    "Nir Eyal's post 12h ago": "That embarrassing thing you said years ago? It may not have happened the way you remember.\n\nYour brain isn't a recording device. It's more like a storyteller who constantly edits the script. \n\nThis unreliable narration can lead to \"self-gaslighting,\" where we use distorted memories to reinforce negative beliefs about ourselves.\n\nI've found that understanding memory's fallibility is surprisingly liberating. Instead of obsessing over whether your perception is objectively true, ask a more useful question: \n\nDoes this belief serve me?\n\nOur memories aren't truths set in stone. They're stories we can choose to rewrite with more compassion and empowerment.\n\nSwipe through to discover how your memory tricks you and what you can do about it.\n\nRead the full article here: https://lnkd.in/eY73JTa8",

    "Vani Kola's post 16h ago": "There‚Äôs a Sanskrit saying that has echoed in my mind lately: Vinasha Kale Viparitha Buddhi. ‚ÄúIn times of decline, the mind turns destructive.‚Äù\n \nI can‚Äôt think of a more apt reflection for what‚Äôs happening to America‚Äôs most respected educational institutions, places like Harvard, which have long been symbols of intellectual rigor, open dialogue, and global collaboration. And more specifically, the quiet devastation now being felt by international students, many of whom arrived with hopes and dreams, just as I did nearly 40 years ago.\n \nIn 1985, I set foot on American shores as an international student. I came with the same optimism many students still carry today. I felt welcomed. My worldviews expanded as I encountered people who were curious about my background and who shared their own stories.\n \nToday, I feel distraught. It‚Äôs hard to put into words the emotions I feel watching this slow erosion of trust. Trust in institutions that stood as beacons of fairness and justice. Trust that if you worked hard, if you contributed meaningfully, you‚Äôd be given a fair chance. That your background, while part of your identity, wouldn‚Äôt become the sole lens through which you were judged.\n \nWhat is gained by eroding trust in educational institutions that have stood for decades as models of excellence and inclusion? What‚Äôs achieved by painting entire institutions with broad, politicized strokes? Who wins in this battle, where the collateral damage is students, used as pawns, many of whom came here on the promise of fairness, hard work, and justice?\n \nInternational students contribute immensely to the U.S., not just culturally and academically, but economically. In the 2023-2024 academic year alone, over 1.1 million international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs. At Harvard, international students make up about a quarter of the student body, enriching the campus with diverse perspectives and experiences.\n \nThis isn‚Äôt about one university or one issue. It‚Äôs about the broader implications of undermining institutions that shape not just minds, but futures. It‚Äôs about the message we send to the world: that America‚Äôs doors, once open to talent and ambition from every corner of the globe, are narrowing under the weight of internal discord.\n \nI don‚Äôt write this with anger. I write it with deep sadness, and a hope that we can pause long enough to consider the long-term damage being done. To remember that educational institutions aren‚Äôt battlegrounds for political point-scoring. They are sanctuaries for learning, for questioning, for challenging norms. For building bridges between cultures and nations.\n \nBecause Vinasha Kale Viparitha Buddhi is not just a cautionary phrase‚Äîit‚Äôs a warning. A warning that in trying to destroy others, we may end up damaging ourselves with short-sightedness.\n\n#HarvardUniversity #Diversity #Leadership",

    "Michelle Chaffee's post 11h ago": "Almost all of the hundreds of books pulled from the shelves of the Naval Academy library, have been returned. \n\nThanks in great part to USNA alumni including William Marks and a group of parents. Marks immediately took action when the books were pulled and started Operation Caged Bird to buy the books that had been removed and hand them out to midshipman. Hundreds of alumni, some now active duty military leaders wrote letters and signed petitions, stating their objection and those efforts had an impact. \n\nHow was this efficient? Forcing staff at USNA to remove hundreds of specific titles, professors having to adjust their teaching curriculum and bringing into question the quality of college education at what is known as one of the nation's finest colleges. Many professors quit or retired early in protest causing the academy to need to find and hire new educators.  \n\n\"Move fast and break things\" is a philosophy in tech. So is \"fail fast.\"  Not so much in our military. The action taken at the Naval Academy did damage. More damage than is known by most. Midshipman were harmed in this debacle. Some are still facing repercussions for simply picking up a book and reading it's pages, for daring to exercise a freedom that is a cornerstone of our democracy. \n\nThis is in no way \"great\" now nor is it a reminder of a similar action in the past that was \"great.\"\n\nPeaceful protest works, courageous actions are worthwhile and very, very American. üá∫üá∏",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 12h ago": "Ignore the Algorithm\n\nThere‚Äôs an entire content industry built around trying to decode LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm‚Äîwhen to post, what format to use, how many lines to write before the ‚Äúsee more‚Äù cut-off.\n\nSome of this advice is practical and actionable, but it‚Äôs really just table stakes if you‚Äôre trying to build an audience and engage with people. \n\nAfter 11 years of writing on this platform, and after earning Top Voice recognition four years in a row, I can tell you this: the algorithm isn‚Äôt your audience.\n\nReal people are.\n\nYour time is far better spent understanding who you‚Äôre writing for, what you want to say, why it matters, and then spending the time and effort to craft content that resonates with your intended audience. \n\nAlgorithms change (and believe me I‚Äôve seen a lot of changes over the past decade). Your voice doesn‚Äôt have to. \n\nIn the early days, I knew some of the editors in LinkedIn‚Äôs New York office. They would often hand select and promote my posts to a much wider audience beyond my own network. \n\nThese were the ones they felt were thoughtful, original, and honest‚Äînot the ones that followed some formula. Like my very first viral article, ‚ÄúWhy Apple owes my mom a huge thank-you‚Äù, where I shared the story of my mother cashing in her government bonds so she could buy my first computer when I was 13 years old. \n\nAnd while the ‚Äúhuman editors‚Äù (their term, not mine) have ceded to the algorithm most of the decisions around what content gets that extra boost, at the end of the day, people still click on and engage with content that resonates with them, that they learn from, that inspires them, that they feel is worth sharing.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs not something you can achieve by ‚Äúgaming the system.‚Äù\n\nImpressions fade. Impact lasts. \n\nWrite for people, not the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n‚û°Ô∏è What do you think? How much weight do you place on understanding and trying to write and post content that fulfills the supposed requirements of the algorithm?\n\nüîîPlease follow or connect with me for more of my takes on work, life, and everything in-between.",
