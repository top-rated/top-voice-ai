    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 3mo ago": "In the eyes of skeptics, #crypto has been \"dying\" ever since it was born. For those declaring crypto \"dead,\" history certainly has a way of proving otherwise.\n\nNot long ago, skeptics dismissed crypto and #blockchain as passing trends, especially during bear markets like 2018 and 2022. But the data tells a different story. The global crypto market cap, which peaked at over $2 trillion, is surging, with institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity embracing #Bitcoin #ETFs. Ethereum processes over 1 million transactions daily, powering DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized apps. Meanwhile, 425 million people globally own cryptocurrency—a 39% year-over-year increase. Blockchain technology isn’t just surviving; it’s thriving, evolving from speculation into a tool reshaping industries.\n\nBeyond digital currencies, blockchain’s potential to disrupt industries is enormous. Imagine mortgage processing reduced from weeks to hours with smart contracts automating compliance and execution. Tokenized real estate could enable fractional ownership and unprecedented liquidity, while supply chains use blockchain to ensure transparency and authenticity. Blockchain has the power to redefine sales contracts, healthcare records, intellectual property, and more—any system relying on trust and intermediaries can be transformed.\n\nNow, pair this innovation with #AI. AI can analyze blockchain data to detect fraud, optimize smart contracts, or even predict market trends. Together, these technologies could create autonomous, self-executing ecosystems in finance, real estate, and beyond. We’re at the cusp of a new digital era where blockchain and AI don’t just coexist—they amplify each other, unlocking unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and innovation. For those still declaring crypto and blockchain “dead,” it’s clear we’re only getting started.\n\nFor any industry to thrive safely, and protect consumers, it needs clear legislative frameworks, legal regulation and oversight, and customer protection. Clear rules can prevent fraud, protect consumer funds, and boost innovation by giving businesses and investors confidence. Prioritizing transparency, accountability, and security ensures blockchain and digital assets become tools for progress, not crime, fraud and misuse. Digital assets regulation isn’t a barrier—it’s the foundation for a trustworthy and scalable future.\n\n(At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin spot price is $106,787 - an all time high. Crypto's future has never been brighter, and this is only the beginning)",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 7mo ago": "Some general thoughts on the state of Generative AI:\n\n- Unstructured data remains the biggest opportunity areas for innovation. Interestingly, it's also also the least invested in. \n\nI spoke about this last year at a prominent Tech Week conference. 80%-90% of the world's data is unstructured. This data is mostly disjoined, uncollated, way under-analyzed. It's also incredibly valuable. Cutting across virtually every industry, unlocking unstructured data with Generative AI is a complete world game changer. It is a hard problem to solve, which is why so few companies and start-ups are trying to solve it. But whoever successfully cracks this Goliath will become a Fortune 100 company.\n\n- Start-ups in Generative AI continue to build LLM wrappers around the major Large Language Models (the easy out). The LLMs themselves are also building a lot of the same tech, which is leading to both an AI bubble in VC investment, as well as AI start-ups having an increasingly difficult time growing into their valuation. Just as with digital, mobile, crypto, etc., few companies will actually emerge as winners in the long-run.\n\n- Search as we know it is changing. People increasingly use LLMs to get more precise search results than Google is providing, either via a free or subscription model. Eventually, a search provider will emerge that will offer ad-free search by subscription that mimics or betters the current search engine experience. \n\nAdvertising-based search is both controversial and archaic. Consumers will pay a premium for a great product (see Netflix, InstaCart, Uber, etc.). \n\n- The newest Llama release (Llama 3.1) is absolutely amazing. I've worked with the 4 major LLMs since their beta release, and right now, LLama 3.1 is leading the pack. It is absolutely fascinating to watch this race, with every major LLM outdoing the other on an almost weekly basis. It's also fascinating to see how the initial dominance of OpenAI, and the gold rush to that, is now being disrupted by something as terrific as Llama which is an open-source product.\n\n- The above is creating a new version of the Windows vs. Linux competition. Who wins, ultimately? Consumers. Expect usage prices for LLMs to drop, and  innovation to continue and accelerate\n\n- Compute is the world's most valuable commodity. I remarked last year that the race in 2024 will be the GPU/chipset race. nVidia has been the clear winner to date - kudos to them for the innovation they have brought. However, LLama 3 is training on Qualcomm, Gemini on their own TPUs, Anthropic on AWS's Trainium chips. Others are pushing the innovation envelope. \n\nPay attention to the other players in the GPU/chipset game - and for VCs/Founders, invest in/invent tech that optimizes model training costs. \n\n- As popular as generative AI has become, we are literally sitting at \"we've just invented the wheel\" stage. So much more is coming. Strap in, and buckle up :) \n\n#generativeAI #LLM #nvidia #OpenAI #Llama #Gemini #Anthropic #Innovation",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 7mo ago": "As #bitcoin prices near all time highs again, and #ethereum ETFs begin to trade, I chuckle a bit at blockchain/crypto pessimists whose thesis that \"crypto has no value, no utility, it's fake, it won't make it, etc.\" has not only been proven wrong, but proven colossally wrong. \n\n\"Crypto Winter\" absolutely needed to happen. There were too many scams, too many bad actors, and ambiguity around regulation (which, in part, still exists, in the US more than anywhere else). However, if memory serves, very similar things happened in the late 90s/early 2000s with OTC/penny stock trading, \"pump and dump\" schemes, and so on. We didn't stop trading stocks. We regulated the market, took enforcement action against the bad players, and brought things towards normal.\n\nThe people that don't believe in #crypto don't understand three things: One, the utility of #blockchain technology (which will disrupt literally every single industry in one form or another). Second, the dire need for innovation in banking and conventional finance (cFI). Interestingly, they're the incumbents, and for decades, they haven't been forced to innovate. They're also the ones that are screaming the loudest against decentralized finance (deFI).\n\nWhich brings us to our third and most important point - the need for a *REGULATED* (yes, I absolutely support meaningful regulation in crypto), decentralized financial marketplace that is not tethered to a government sponsored banking system. As the utility of crypto grows worldwide, especially in third-world countries where inflation is rampant and consumers are underbanked, alongside the increased adoption of digital currency, the value of deFI increases exponentially.\n\nFor those that insisted that crypto was dead for the past 2 years, sorry that you were on the wrong side of the trade. It happens. If this is still your thesis, I respectfully suggest educating yourself on crypto/blockchain. Even given the advent of Generative AI, the blockchain is still the world's most disruptive technology to date, and that genie's never going back in the bottle. It will only grow bigger and change the world as we know it.",

We delved into lessons from major setbacks, drawing from a real-life example during my time at Amazon. This experience (my podcast debut) was truly invigorating - and a helpful reminder that the initial nerves fade away quickly, and the deer in the headlights look is temporary :).\n\nI'm still excited to announce my own podcast, \"Start With 'I' Can,\" set to launch in a month at the latest.

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 10mo ago": "One of my favorite topics to debate in generative AI is hallucinations, and the actual need for their existence (not \"eliminating\" them, as just about every generative AI company infers)\n\nWhat are hallucinations, exactly? AI \"hallucinations\" were defined in the 1980s in computer vision. Computer vision scientists began using the term to describe how their models would \"fill in\" missing or ambiguous image details – much like our own brains do – often resulting in improved overall image quality. This concept of generating non-existent but plausible features proved beneficial in several applications, such as image restoration and super-resolution. In my and my team's early work on Project Blackbeard and AWS Rekognition, we actually leveraged AI hallucinations to enhance images\n\nAs Generative AI took a prominent, user-facing role in today's technology, the term \"hallucination\" is now used to describe when models confidently assert something that's factually incorrect. Today's generative AI can and does \"hallucinate\" facts, with serious consequences in fields like engineering, science, and medicine\n\nShould we eliminate hallucinations entirely? No - and truthfully, we actually can't. In creative fields, hallucinations are the engine of innovation. Generative AI's ability to generate novel ideas is actually what makes it so powerful. The solution lies in software as the solution - another play on SaaS? :) - that does the following:\n\n- Adapt to context, adjusting the \"hallucination\" level based on the task and field, enforcing strict constraints for factual domains, and creative freedom for others\n\n- Encourage collaboration between human experts and AI models (Human-In-The-Loop). Human oversight can catch and correct hallucinations, ensuring that the AI’s outputs are both innovative and accurate. This partnership leverages the strengths of both human intuition and machine efficiency\n\n- Ensures transparency and explainability. Develop AI systems that can explain their reasoning and the sources of their information. Transparent AI models allow users to understand how conclusions are drawn, making it easier to identify and correct hallucinations when they occur\n\n(personally, I believe transparent AI is an absolute necessity, and will eventually be required by law, as AI legislation is actively being shaped. Companies that get an early start here will have a huge competitive advantage in the not too distant future)\n\nOur AI future is ultimately a collaborative dance, involving a harmonious partnership between human and machine. We can leverage AI's generative power while maintaining our critical thinking and ethical judgment. By acknowledging the dual nature of \"hallucination\" and designing software that embraces its creative potential while mitigating risks, we can unlock a new era of innovation and expression and drive progress and across a wide range of fields and industries\n\n#AI #GenerativeAI #Creativity #Innovation #Hallucination #Engineering",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 10mo ago": "After what seems like a lifetime (23 years) in the corporate world, I'm taking a self-initiated and very intentional break from work to recalibrate and give myself the opportunity to be very introspective about what comes next, life and career-wise. This past Tuesday was my last day at Nasdaq. I leave with nothing but reverence and respect for the company and Adena Friedman, who is truly the best CEO in the game. They were incredibly supportive of my decision to take a life break, and I absolutely LOVED my time at Nasdaq - a world class company that lives their values every day. Truly a bittersweet departure. \n\nTaking stock of my career, I'm frankly surprised of how far I've come. In 2001, I was a starry-eyed database developer, and (for the moment) ending as a Fortune 500 SVP and executive seems unreal in so many ways. I'm grateful for every step in the journey, grateful to everyone that took time to help me grow along the way, and especially thankful to all the folks that worked for me. Whatever success I've had, the credit is really theirs.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n- This is the first time in 23 years that I've jumped without a parachute, so to speak. I don't take it for granted that I have the ability to do so, and I don't intend to waste the opportunity. I truly don't know what comes next. A few companies have already contacted me, for which I'm humbled and grateful (and certainly listening as others reach out!). I'm going to be incredibly discerning about what I do next from a professional/career perspective, with a focus on a mission driven differentiator.\n\n- I'm going to use my voice and experience to help others. A podcast is launching soon, named \"Start With I Can\", alongside a book with the same title, that will cover my journey and experiences throughout my career, and what I've learned. The name comes from the life-changing advice my good friend Arvind Sethuraman gave me back in 2011, while we were colleagues at Microsoft. Thank you Arvind - it literally redefined the way I think. I'm also going to be building some interesting products, from scratch - stay tuned for more!!\n\n- I'm going to decompress, reconnect with family and friends at a deeper level, and find ways to give time (the most precious commodity we have) back to those close in my life, and others who need it. \n\nThere are too many people to thank who unselfishly and givingly helped me on my journey. You know who you are, and you have my forever gratitude. \n\n(in order: Reliant Energy, bp, Microsoft, Amazon, Bright Machines, Venmo, PayPal, Nasdaq - thank you for everything).\n\nI'm excited, apprehensive and slightly terrified :). Today is, as always, #DayOne",

In an incredibly tough family situation, and chatting with/counseling a Director level executive who is beyond excellent and has literally hung moons for their company, but who, through circumstances not of their making, delayed a delivery and is getting squeezed and criticized from/by their management.\n\nFirst, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES. None of this actually matters in the scheme of overall life. In 30-50 years, we'll be lucky to still be alive and we absolutely won't remember what happened at work on this day or that day. Work actively to make your family your VERY FIRST priority, not just say it. It's worth it.\n\nSecond - if you're a manager and you have an employee that's struggling with something, especially one of your absolute stars (but really anyone), how about instead of starting with criticism, you start with this:\n\n\"I'm really sorry this situation didn't go as planned. Don't let this get to you. You're an absolute rock star and I know and appreciate everything you've done for us. Is there anything I can do to help make this easier?\"\n\nMy God, really, how hard is that? How about showing GRATITUDE, COMPASSION, EMPATHY, APPRECIATION, and offering HELP, instead of criticizing in the moment - especially for someone who flat out kills it for you and is a 10X force multiplier? \n\nI guarantee you that an extraordinary performer is already self-flagellating, criticizing themselves, and looking at every angle where they could have done better. \n\nThey don't need their boss doing it FOR THEM, not at that moment. They need empathy, positive reinforcement, and support from their leader. They need PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY. They need to know that their boss understands, and has their back. And that above everything else - IT'S OK. The moment to triage and do lessons learned will come, but that's later.\n\nI have never understood why the majority of managers choose in the moment micro aggression and criticism instead of empathy and support. The former are two of the biggest demoralizers and attrition-inducers that exist in the workplace. Do better or you'll find your regretted attrition spike, and your 10X force multiplier hanging moons for your competitors. \n\nYou can be a performance driven leader and be empathetic at the same time. As a matter of fact, you have to be. The top down, aggressive pressure  leadership culture of yesterday is no longer acceptable or welcome.\n\n#leadership #management #culture",

They're having one of their best years. What was the key to their success?\n\n\"We don't believe in building armies. We hire really good people, pay them well, and run lean. And we've always run and operated our company like we are in a constant bear market, and we are relentless about delivery and results\"\n\nFrugality matters. You don't have to go to extremes - making money requires spending money, but lavish, excesses, bloat and inefficiency are all massive anchors that, especially in hard financial times, drag companies right to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nI took away a lot of lessons from Microsoft in the Ballmer era, mostly on what NOT to do (I have equally been stunned and impressed by Satya and the company's transformation since), and from Amazon on how to run a lean, focused and results/delivery driven organization. \n\nThe next time any company attracts you with free lunches, yoga classes, massages and organic gardens, etc. as perks, ask yourself whether this is truly company money well spent, and how that is helping that company deliver results, win business and keep customers happy.\n\n#leadership #pragmatism",

Thank you LinkedIn family and truly humbled]\n\nEveryone, I'm excited to announce I'm starting a podcast! Over the past two years I've been encouraged by multiple folks to do this, and I hope I'm able to both give back and learn through this process. We'll cover technology topics in general, from ongoing trends to innovation to leadership, as well as recount war stories and industry lore, so to speak. \n\n(I'm also taking suggestions for podcast names. My brain is terribly wired to the left, and I have an almost nonexistent creative side when it comes to naming and branding. Please help if you can lol).\n\nI will also focus on professional/life topics helpful to those just starting out in tech, and I, along with guests, will share our experiences, mistakes, successes, good/bad managers, workplace heroics, horror stories, moments of note, etc. I have 4 guests already lined up and I'm pretty excited to do this, and hope to be able to give back from my experiences and those of my guests, as well as continue to learn and grow in the process.\n\nHelp wanted: I need to buy a decent microphone and some other equipment. Would be very grateful for any direction/recommendations from experienced podcasters, and would be equally grateful for whatever tips/tricks/guidance they can provide for having/running a successful podcast.\n\nPlease feel free to DM me for above, and likewise, please DM me if you're interested in being a guest speaker. More details soon!!\n\n#tech #leadership #podcast",

You have to fix it right away\"\n\nYou (confused): \"This is already in our backlog as a P2/P3.\" Or: \"We decided not to take this bug because we have an upcoming release that fixes it and have higher priority items to work on this sprint\". Or: \"This isn't a bug, it actually works like this by design - remember when we had that meeting and we wanted user flow/color/whatever to be this?\"\n\nManager: \"Yes, but so and so hates it so we need to drop everything and fix it right now.\"\n\nThis is one of the WORST POSSIBLE THINGS you can do to any dev or dev team. It's disrespectful, demoralizing and LITERALLY derails projects, breaks builds, randomizes entire teams, and severely harms engineering morale. As a Dev, it happened to me many times and I can't remember one instance where the urgency was actually valid, and I didn't hate the experience.\n\nExecutives: STOP DOING THIS. Seriously. Ask questions instead. \"I found this bug, or what I think is a bug. Please help me understand if there are plans to fix it, or please educate me on why this works the way it does\". Don't just knee jerk and fire from the hip.\n\nManagers: HAVE BACKBONE, and respectfully but firmly give your folks aircover. \"I understand and I'm sorry. This is actually in our backlog to fix on xyz date.\" When they insist \"Please understand that this would break our build/derail the team/slow down overall release and progress\". Or. \"We decided as an organization that it should work this way and this is by design, but we're happy to re-raise this at our next ship room/product review/whatever meeting\".\n\nThis is also a great opportunity for managers to familiarize execs with how to file bugs. Most execs don't know how (in my opinion they absolutely should) \"Have you filed this in Jira? Would you like to know how?\" If they refuse: \"I am happy to file this on your behalf and will keep you posted on progress.\"\n\nObvious exceptions are P1/P0 bugs, but that's almost never the case here and teams know how to handle those anyway in emergent fashion with all hands on deck.\n\nHave patience, trust the process, protect your team and folks. Use good judgement, take time to educate, be pragmatic. Not everything's a fire or needs to be. In fact, most things aren't. \n\n#dobetter",

Cryptocurrency has long passed the \"market test\", as it were. Its use cases have exploded - crypto is here to stay and being incubated in our lives more and more on a daily basis.\n\nHowever - until security, scalability and performance and trustworthiness are taken seriously, cryptocurrency will never gain institutional acceptance. The example below would never be acceptable with a traditional bank, custodian, exchange or retailer, and is the exact reason why cryptocurrency has not gained greater (and well deserved) traction among large financial institutions, public companies, pension funds, etc. \n\nThe frequent security breaches, exchange downtime during high liquidity events, disregard for needed regulation, rug pulls, and most important, shrugging off these events as \"another day in crypto\" by the respective company operators absolutely have to stop, because just as with fiat currency, real people lose money and it's absolutely not okay.\n\nIn my opinion, cryptocurrency is the greatest technical invention of our lifetime. However, the prominent players in crypto are just NOT addressing the fundamentals: security, scalability, trust and regulation with the same levels of well deserved professional paranoia as they would if they were handling fiat currency (read dollars, euros, gold etc) on behalf of their customers. \n\nUntil that happens, crypto will remain a mostly retail, speculative product - hurting its adoption and ability to truly change the world.\n\n#cryptocurrency #security #scalability #trust",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 3yr ago": "(A tale of two \"unsubscribe me's\"): \n\nI'm certain most of us have suffered from the accidental internal mass email, where everyone replies all with \"Unsubscribe\", the effect of which is email becoming useless for a day or so. For every company this has happened at, at least in my experience, this turns into a Microsoft Exchange outage within hours, if not minutes, due to immediate load spikes, and email becomes unavailable or at the very least unusable.\n\n... Except at Amazon. The one \"unsubscribe me\" event at Amazon that I was a part of turned into a movement. The trolling interest DL was added to the thread. People banded in unison to try to take down Exchange. Which turned into someone replying all with the Exchange performance graphs. Then the party really started.\n\nOne developer requested a \"ship it\" on a trivial pull request. Which quickly received thousands of \"ship-its\", some with little ships drawn as comments. Some took the time to advertise used silverware, appliances and video game consoles for sale. Many others viewed this as an opportunity to ask for opinions about everything from investment advice to fitness tips and everything in between. And so on. We were all united in one goal: take down Exchange. The volume of email had exploded and the ripple turned into a tidal wave.\n\nWithin 3 hours or so, someone stepped in and blocked the offending DL from receiving emails. No punitive action was taken, as far as I can remember. And while the PMET graphs showed clear load spikes, Exchange running on AWS never even as much as blinked. \n\nMoral of the story? Learn from everything, and never waste a good crisis. Oh, and fun matters. Anything can be fun, even (and maybe especially) an innocent mistake.\n\n#culturematters",

Some of the most salient parts:\n\n****\n\n“Choked innovation. By its very nature, innovation disrupts the status quo. And yet it’s the lifeblood of growth. Innovation is also a social process that requires divergent thinking and courageous conversations. Pervasive niceness suppresses this process, creating an intellectual muzzle that can turn teams of exceptionally talented people into dysfunctional groups. I frequently work with institutions that desperately need to boost innovation but their nice cultures slow the speed of discovery.”\n\nProvide air cover for candor. When people do have the courage to express dissenting views and speak candidly, protect them. Reduce the risk of ridicule by thanking those who do. As you accommodate dissent, you will gradually recast the norm until it becomes a cultural expectation.\n\n*****\n\n#innovation #work #leadership #accountability",

Two of these elevators are out for the foreseeable future, leaving residents with extended wait times and, needless to say, tons of frustration. Apparently they have to custom-make these parts somewhere and we won't have a fully functional elevator bank until June at the earliest.\n\nOne day this month, coming home with a few groceries, I got tired of waiting. So I took the stairs up. TWENTY TWO floors, double flights. By the time I got to my floor I was hallucinating. That signaled that while I thought I was in great shape, my cardiovascular resistance could use some work.  Now I take the stairs down down and up, once a day. It's been getting easier every day.\n\nMorals of the story:\n\n- Stuff's gonna break in life (the elevators)\n- Don't worry about the stuff that's out of your control (the elevator parts)\n- Control what you can (the stairs)\n- There's always another way (take the stairs)\n- You can learn from any situation (need better cardio!!)\n- Always look for silver linings (taking the stairs == better cardio)\n\nLast, and most important:\n\n- Don't wait for someone else to determine your destination or how fast you get there.

This is not only a misconception, it can be disastrous if the strategy to culture turnaround is viewed as a \"big ship turnaround\".\n\nTurning a culture around involves turning around a bunch of canoes AT THE SAME TIME. If a company has 50 thousand people, for instance, it's not a big boat that has 50 thousand occupants that has to turn. It's 50 thousand canoes that all have to turn in the same direction, at the same time.\n\nMost leaders automatically default to the ship, because they're the captains of \"some big thing\" - (a ship). The reality is, the reason the culture has to turn around is because not only is everyone not on the ship, not everyone that's in a canoe is rowing/paddling in the same direction in the first place.\n\nSee the difference? Which one is harder? And more important, which one more closely mirrors reality? If you lose sight/focus of the fact that there's more to the culture than \"the big boat\", the canoes will bump into each other, flip over, and either row away, drown or create general chaos.\n\nMoral of the story: be the lead rower and shepherd, not the captain. There's a difference. And bring all the canoes along, as smoothly as possible. \n\n#leadership #culture #change",

The result? Lots of activity, but little impact.\n\nAs Isabelle  puts it, the key to AI success isn’t just adopting the technology—it’s aligning AI initiatives with real business goals. That means:\n\n ✅ Starting with the outcomes. Are you driving revenue? Reducing churn? Enhancing customer loyalty?\n ✅ Building an org-wide AI strategy. AI isn’t just a tool for IT, it requires leadership buy-in across the board.\n ✅ Implementing governance & ethics guidelines—Scaling AI means ensuring compliance and brand integrity at every step.\n\nIf AI isn’t integrated strategically, companies risk falling behind those that move decisively.\n\nSo, is your business truly AI-ready?

It's human connection\n\nBillions have been spent on automation, AI-driven workflows, and CRMs in the pursuit of efficiency. But let's be honest, who wants to be \"optimized\"?\n\nAt KFC, the magic isn't just in speed or technology. It's in creating finger-licking experiences that keep guests coming back. As Rob Swain, Global Chief Operating Officer at KFC, highlighted on stage at X4, that means balancing the power of AI-driven insights with the human moments that make a difference.\n\nFrom a single franchise in Salt Lake City to 30,000+ locations worldwide, KFC has evolved alongside rising customer expectations. The modern quick-service restaurant (QSR) space is no longer just about drive-thru and counter service, it's an intricate web of delivery, kiosks, and digital interactions. \n\nWhile technology has created more convenience for guests, it has also introduced complexity for frontline teams. Here's the real challenge: How do you use technology to enhance, not replace, the human connection?\n\nKFC partnered with Qualtrics to transform guest and team member insights into real-time action, ensuring that every experience, whether in Johannesburg, Bangkok, or Lima, feels seamless. \n\nWhat was the ROI? A 300% increase in customer feedback records, faster decision-making, and a new era of predictive analytics to anticipate guest needs before they arise.\n\nBut the real takeaway (see what I did there) isn't just about tech, it's about listening, acting fast, and making every interaction meaningful.\n\nSo, here's the question for every business: Are you using technology to understand your customers and employees, or are you just optimizing?\n\nHow are you balancing automation with human connection in your organization?\n\n#X4SLC #Qualtrics #QualtricsX4 #BestAdvice #Technology"

AI isn’t replacing knowledge workers. It’s redefining what knowledge work looks like. The best employees won’t be the ones who refuse to use AI but those who know how to leverage it, refine its output, and make it better.\n\nAt Section, job candidates are given an assignment: use AI to generate a first version, then improve it as a human. That’s the skill companies actually need. Not isolation, but collaboration with AI.\n\nSo, instead of discouraging AI in education, shouldn’t we be teaching students how to use it effectively?

      " Hughes's post 1w ago": "Alexa+ is a generative AI-powered upgrade that promises to take voice assistants beyond setting timers and playing music. But does this mark a true evolution in AI-powered assistance, or is it another attempt to nudge users deeper into Amazon’s ecosystem?\n\nAlexa was once at the heart of the smart home revolution, but over the years, the excitement faded. Slow responses, limited capabilities, and the rise of more advanced AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini made the once-beloved assistant feel outdated. \n\nNow, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can change the narrative—with agentic AI that can schedule appointments, order groceries, and even analyze security footage.\n\nBut there’s a catch. Alexa+ isn’t free. If you’re not a Prime member, it’ll cost $19.99 a month. A bold move in a world where AI-powered tools are becoming more accessible. Will consumers be willing to pay for an AI assistant that’s still tightly bound to Amazon’s ecosystem?\n\nThe bigger question is: Does Alexa+ truly change how we interact with AI, or is it another walled garden in disguise?\n\n🔹 Will it deliver seamless, context-aware AI, or will it stumble in real-world scenarios?\n 🔹 Can it shake off the “kitchen timer” reputation and become indispensable?\n 🔹 Is the subscription model a dealbreaker, or does the convenience justify the cost?\n\nI explore these questions in my latest article. But I’d love to hear from you: Will you be subscribing to Alexa+? Or do you think smart assistants have already had their moment?\n\nDrop your thoughts in the comments! 👇\n\n#Technology #Future #ArtificialIntelligence #Digital"

I spoke with several AI and cybersecurity leaders to explore this intersection of innovation and regulation:\n\n🔹 Juan Orlandini, CTO of North America at Insight, breaks AI risk into three categories: creators, adapters, and consumers—each facing distinct challenges. \"It is 100% opportunity,\" he says, but only for those who build AI responsibly.\n🔹 Bindi Davé, Deputy CISO at DigiCert & Global Ambassador with the Global Council for Responsible AI highlights the critical role of AI governance. She emphasizes transparency, ethical guidelines, and \"red teaming\" to mitigate risks and build stakeholder trust.\n🔹 Randy Weakly, Chief AI Architect at ImageSource, discusses how AI capabilities are already embedded in everyday tools like HubSpot, Adobe, and GitHub Copilot—often unnoticed by IT and security teams. He warns that a lack of oversight could lead to unintended consequences.\n🔹 Manoj Kuruvanthody at Tredence Inc., stresses that AI governance must be proactive, not reactive. He advocates for real-time risk assessments and AI audit frameworks to align with global regulatory standards. \"Traditional compliance mechanisms won’t be enough,\" he cautions.\n\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into business operations, the balance between innovation and compliance will define success.

The big question is: can AI optimize our energy use to the point where it not only saves money but also contributes to a more sustainable future?\n\nI recently explored this topic with Michael Lotfy Gierges, VP of Schneider Electric’s home and residential business, to discuss how #AI is already reshaping how we manage climate control, EV charging, and energy consumption at home. \n\nOne of the biggest surprises? Many homeowners still believe turning off lights is the key to reducing their bills—when in reality, HVAC systems and EV chargers often account for 60% of a home’s total energy use.\n\nMichael explains that AI-powered energy management systems don’t just monitor usage; they learn, adapt, and optimize—helping homeowners cut costs while making their homes smarter and more sustainable. Imagine a future where your home automatically sells excess solar energy back to the grid or strategically charges your EV when energy prices are at their lowest.\n\nGovernments are stepping up, but there are still challenges—from regulatory barriers to consumer adoption. Will AI-driven homes become the norm, or will hesitancy around automation slow down progress?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!

With AI, hybrid cloud, and high-performance computing generating massive storage demands, enterprises need a new way to access and orchestrate data across edge, data centers, and the cloud.\n\nHammerspace is having a breakout year, reporting 10x revenue growth, fueled by the rising demand for AI storage and hybrid cloud solutions. At the heart of this success is its Global Data Platform, which eliminates data silos and ensures seamless access to unstructured data—no matter where it resides.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from our discussion was the role of Parallel Network File System (pNFS) and why it’s becoming a game-changer for enterprise storage. Unlike traditional storage architectures, pNFS separates metadata from data, unlocking extreme parallel performance without the usual bottlenecks. But as David explains, storage performance alone isn’t enough—true data orchestration is the missing piece.\n\nWe also explored why global namespaces alone are not a solution, and how Hammerspace is combining them with data orchestration to create a system that moves, accesses, and utilizes data efficiently across distributed environments. This shift is critical as enterprises struggle to keep pace with AI-driven analytics, GPU computing, and hybrid cloud strategies.\n\nWith its recent recognition as TechTarget’s Storage Product of the Year and a new Chief Revenue Officer joining the team, Hammerspace is scaling rapidly to meet the evolving needs of AI-powered businesses.\n\nSo, what does the future hold for AI storage and enterprise data management?

Before the start of the The IT Press Tour, I visited Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, where the now-famous Sign 24 stands.\n\nThe famous sign promoting 1 Hacker Way has replaced the famous Facebook Thumbs Up with the Meta logo. But if you take a peek behind the sign, it still has the Sun Microsystems branding. \n\nIt’s more than just a remnant of the past. It’s a silent reminder that no company, no matter how dominant, is immune to disruption.\n\nFacebook moved into the former Sun Microsystems campus in 2011, but instead of replacing the sign entirely, Mark Zuckerberg had it flipped. The message was clear: stay hungry, stay adaptable—or risk becoming history.\n\nSun Microsystems was once a titan of the industry, pioneering open-source software, Java, and powerful workstations that fueled the internet’s early days. Yet, despite its technical brilliance, it failed to navigate changing market conditions and was ultimately acquired by Oracle. \n\nToday, the Sun logo remains hidden in plain sight, a lesson for all innovators and tech leaders.\n\nThe same dynamic plays out across the Valley. Apple Park stands where Hewlett-Packard once defined an era. Tesla occupies the site of the former NUMMI auto plant. Reinvention is constant, and survival depends on anticipating the next shift before it arrives.\n\nIt’s easy to celebrate success, but the true lessons lie in understanding what happens when companies fail to evolve.

However, there's a catch.\n\nCIOs and CTOs often face pressing questions that need to be answered before AI can drive those results. They must consider the following:\n\n1️⃣ What specific business outcomes are we targeting?\n\n2️⃣ What challenges does our organization aim to solve with AI?\n\n3️⃣ Are we prepared to increase our staffing or budget to implement AI effectively?\n\n4️⃣ How will this fit into our long-term strategy?\n\nVlad emphasizes that while AI offers immediate advantages, understanding the broader implications is crucial for sustainable success.\n\nCurious to learn more?

Here's what they are and how to beat them:\n\n1. The Planning Fallacy makes us underestimate how long tasks take. To fix this, stop relying on to-do lists alone. Instead, use timeboxing to visualize and schedule your time realistically.\n\n2. Liminal Moments are dangerous transition periods when we think \"just checking email for a minute\" won't hurt. Combat these with the 10-minute rule: When you feel the urge to check something, wait 10 minutes. The urge often passes.\n\n3. The Mere Urgency Effect tricks us into prioritizing quick, unimportant tasks over meaningful work. Schedule focused work sessions and communicate them to colleagues to protect your important projects.\n\n4. Productivity Shame keeps us stuck in a cycle of toxic self-criticism. Break free by practicing self-compassion. Talk to yourself like you would a friend.

That if you just find this magical state, hard work will suddenly become easy?\n\nHere’s the truth: Flow isn’t designed for hard work.\n\nResearch shows that flow happens when we’re deeply engaged in activities we already enjoy—like playing sports, painting, or solving puzzles. But what about the tasks that feel boring, frustrating, or just plain hard? That’s when we tend to seek distractions.\n\nThe solution isn’t to chase flow—it’s to build mental resilience for the work that doesn’t feel fun. Here are three strategies that help:\n\n1️⃣ Redefine the discomfort – Instead of seeing boredom or frustration as barriers, see them as signals that you’re doing meaningful work. The ability to sit with discomfort is what separates high achievers.\n2️⃣ Use the “Just 5 Minutes” rule – If a task feels overwhelming, commit to just five minutes. Once you start, it’s easier to keep going.\n3️⃣ Create external structure – Timers, accountability partners, and clear deadlines remove the need for motivation and force action.\n\nHard work isn’t meant to be easy—it’s meant to be done. The better you get at managing discomfort, the more you can achieve.\n\nNow, I’d love to hear from you: How do you get through the work you’d rather avoid? What’s your strategy for staying on track?

Then, one day, my teacher, Mrs. Dulski, pulled me aside, walked me into another classroom, and showed off my work to another teacher.\n\nThey both looked at me with pride, and in that moment, something shifted. I felt seen, capable, special. That was the moment I went from a C and D student to an A student.\n\nDid she really believe in me? I’ll never know. But what I do know is that her words changed how I saw myself—and that changed everything.\n\nNo matter who you are, you have the power to change someone’s life just by believing in them.

Schedule time for what's important in your life (you, relationships, work)\n2. Eliminate all white space in your calendar (yes, all of it)\n3.

Ego Depletion: The myth that willpower is a limited resource. Research shows this isn't true—willpower ebbs and flows like an emotion.\n\n2. Imposter Syndrome: Not actually a syndrome, but a cognitive bias that makes you question your abilities without reason. Paradoxically, the more successful you become, the stronger it gets.\n\n3. Your Inner Critic: That voice calling you \"stupid\" or \"an idiot.\" This negative self-talk dampens motivation and fuels anxiety.\n\n4. Distraction: Anything pulling you away from what you want to do. Even seemingly productive tasks like cleaning can be distractions if they prevent you from doing what you said you would.\n\nThe good news is that once you identify these limiting beliefs, you can take steps to overcome them. \n\nThe first step is recognizing which one impacts you most. \n\nYou can learn more about these limiting beliefs here: https://lnkd.in/dQGGPahY",

To many parents, it looks like mindless entertainment. \n\nBut to kids, it's a digital playground where they practice crucial social skills, such as negotiating with friends, resolving conflicts, and building relationships.\n\nParents must understand that play—whether digital or physical—serves a vital developmental purpose. When we restrict play without providing alternatives, we deny our children what they need to grow.\n\nThe solution isn't to cut kids off from technology. It's to ensure they have ample opportunities for meaningful play and social connection in all aspects of their lives.\n\nLet's start viewing play not as a distraction from learning but as the essential work of childhood.

I've found that beating FOMO requires a more nuanced approach than just avoiding social media altogether.\n\nWe must be intentional about how we engage with technology, rather than eliminating it completely.\n\nHere are evidence-backed strategies that work:\n\n1. Embrace JOMO (Joy of Missing Out): Consciously choose to find satisfaction in doing things on your own terms.\n\n2. Use timeboxing: Schedule specific periods for social media use rather than checking compulsively.\n\n3. Create friction: Remove social apps from your phone while keeping desktop access.\n\n4. Set boundaries: Use apps like Forest or Freedom to limit access during focused time.\n\nDisconnecting won’t solve your FOMO.

    "Nir Eyal's post 1mo ago": "The biggest misconception about achieving long-term goals is that you need heroic bursts of effort. You don't. What you need is relentless, consistent progress.\n\nConsider every major achievement in history—from building the pyramids to landing on the moon. None of these happened through sporadic bursts of inspiration. They were accomplished through sustained, methodical effort over time.\n\nThis is why I advocate for timeboxing over to-do lists. Timeboxing helps you focus on input (your time and attention) rather than output (which you can't always control). \n\nBy showing up consistently, even when you don't feel particularly motivated or inspired, you build momentum toward your goals.\n\nAnything worth having takes time. Stop waiting for motivation to strike and start building systems for consistency instead.\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter (link in comments) to learn more about how to achieve your goals!",

Before blaming the technology, consider what they might be missing offline.\n\nResearch shows that humans have three basic psychological needs: autonomy (control over our choices), competence (mastery and growth), and relatedness (feeling connected to others). \n\nWhen kids can't fulfill these needs in their daily lives, they'll seek them elsewhere—often through technology.\n\nThink about it: While we restrict children's freedom at school and home, social media offers endless choices. When they struggle to feel accomplished in academics, games provide constant achievement. And when we limit their ability to socialize freely, their phones offer 24/7 connection.\n\nThe solution isn't taking away their devices. It's ensuring they have opportunities to meet these psychological needs in healthier ways: \n\n- Give them age-appropriate choices. \n- Let them build competence through activities they enjoy. \n- Create spaces for genuine social connection.\n\nTechnology isn't the root cause of our children's distraction—it's just filling a void.

To reduce the total time spent on email (T), we need to address both variables: the number of messages we receive (N) and the time we spend per message (t).\n\nHere's what works:\n\n- Open up office hours instead of endless email chains\n- Delay delivery to slow down the email ping-pong\n- Tag emails by urgency (\"Today\" or \"This Week\")\n- Process emails in batches during scheduled times\n\nBy treating email management as a formula rather than an endless task, we can dramatically reduce time spent in our inboxes.\n\nMake your inbox work for you, not the other way around.",

But here's the thing: \n\nThe most effective leaders don't need fancy corner offices or impressive titles to influence others. They lead through referent power—the ability to influence through their actions and values.\n\nSocial psychologists have found that referent power is the most potent form of influence because it’s authentic, lasting, and contagious. \n\nLeaders can use referent power to create Indistractable workplaces. For example: \n\n1. When you timebox your schedule and honor it, your team learns to respect focused work time\n2. When you keep meetings purposeful and device-free, others follow suit\n3. When you stop sending late-night emails, you show work-life balance is truly valued\n4. When you create space for open dialogue, psychological safety flourishes\n\nYour actions speak louder than any memo or management directive ever could. The way you handle distraction sets the standard for your entire team.",

    "Preethi Kasireddy's post 1mo ago": "What is \"Unexplained Infertility,\" Really?\n\nWe keep getting asked about “Unexplained Infertility” cases. After seeing hundreds of fertility cases over their long careers, here’s what our care team knows: when traditional medicine says that a patient has “unexplained infertility,” it often means “unexplored metabolic dysfunction.”\n\nConventional fertility testing frequently misses:\n\n- Gut inflammation\n- Subclinical thyroid imbalances\n- Cellular and oxidative stress markers\n- Hidden inflammatory responses\n- Metabolic dysfunction beneath \"normal\" lab ranges\n\nThe problem isn't that these cases are unexplainable. It's that we're looking in the wrong places. When your car's check engine light comes on, you don't declare it \"unexplained\" without first looking under the hood.\n\nThe reality is that your reproductive system doesn't operate in isolation. It's deeply connected to your metabolic health. When your metabolic health is compromised, your body is focused on keeping your body alive and reproduction takes a back seat.\n\nThis is why the future of fertility care isn't about better Band-Aids. It's about understanding that infertility is often your body's way of saying something deeper needs attention.\n\nWhat’s your experience with the \"unexplained infertility\" diagnosis? \n#FertilityCare #WomensHealth #FunctionalMedicine #Healthcare",

    "Preethi Kasireddy's post 1mo ago": "Good sleep = improved fertility\n\nIf there’s one solution I would recommend to anyone getting started with their fertility-optimisation journey, it’s sleep. Sleep is an underrated infertility treatment. \n\nYour body won't make babies if it thinks it's running from a tiger. And guess what signals \"running from a tiger\" to your body? Bad sleep.\n\nThink about it. When you don't sleep enough:\n• Your cortisol (stress hormone) skyrockets \n• Your reproductive hormones plummet\n• Your metabolism is suppressed\n• Your body thinks: \"Survival mode: ON\"\n\nEvolution is pretty smart about this. If you're NOT sleeping well, your body assumes you're either:\n1. In danger\n2. Starving\n3. Super stressed\n\nNone of these are great conditions for making babies. So your body does the smart thing - it hits pause on digestion and reproduction.\n\nI see this pattern constantly in fertility cases: People try everything from supplements to expensive treatments, but they're sleeping 5 hours a night and wondering why nothing works.\n\nFertility isn't just about your reproductive organs. It's about making your body feel safe enough to reproduce.\n\nWant to optimize your fertility? Start with sleep. Everything else is just expensive Band-Aids.\n\n#FertilityCare #SleepScience #MetabolicHealth",

    "Preethi Kasireddy's post 1mo ago": "Most fertility clinics won't talk about this, but here's a truth I learned during my own fertility journey: \n\nYour gut health could be the key factor in your fertility struggles. This isn't speculation, or even just anecdotal. There’s research that shows that poor gut health impacts:\n\n- 𝗡𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝗼𝗿𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and folate lead to poor egg and sperm quality.\n\n- 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Gut dysbiosis can trigger systemic inflammation, which then can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and other inflammatory conditions that make it challenging to conceive..\n\n- 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝘆𝘀𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 70% of your immune system lives in your gut. When your gut is inflamed, it creates a series of inflammatory responses that can significantly impact reproductive function. \n\n- 𝗘𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Imbalances in gut bacteria can lead to too high or too low estrogen levels, which can affect ovulation and implantation.\n\nYet the standard fertility treatment protocol completely ignores this connection. When I see clinics jumping straight to IVF without addressing gut health, it's like watching someone cover up mold with paint instead of removing it from the depths of where it originated.\n\nThis is why at Ferta (formerly Akhanda), we're pioneering a different approach: treating fertility as part of a whole-body system, where gut health plays a crucial role in reproductive success.\n\nThe future of fertility care needs to look beyond just reproductive organs. The answers can lie in unexpected places – like your gut microbiome.\n\n#FertilityCare #FunctionalMedicine #WomensHealth #GutHealth",

    "Preethi Kasireddy's post 1mo ago": "𝗙𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻. 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝘆.\n\nThe fertility industry is exploding ($87B by 2033!). Yet, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what causes infertility in the first place.\n\nI realized this firsthand when I was struggling with my own fertility. After 13 years of taking birth control to fix my missing periods and hormonal issues, and then being pushed towards IVF when I was trying to get my period back so that I can get pregnant, I realized something was broken in how we approach fertility care.\n\nHere's what I think most people miss about the infertility crisis:\nWhen reproduction fails, it's rarely just a fertility problem. It's your body's check engine light going off, signaling a deeper, systemic issue. From my research and experience, I now know that this can include:\n\n- Metabolic dysfunction \n- Chronic inflammation\n- Environmental toxins\n- Oxidative stress\n- Psychological stress\n\nIVF success rates are around 15-40% globally, and the odds of success get smaller as women get older. Early research combining functional medicine approaches with traditional treatments shows promising improvements in outcomes - a study conducted with 1000+ infertility patients at an academic fertility center revealed that 80.4% of respondents used at least one integrative medicine modality to conceive. The research is early, but the effectiveness of integrative & functional medicine is too compelling to ignore. \n\nYet most fertility clinics still operate on a symptom-fixing model.\nThis is why functional medicine is revolutionizing fertility care. It treats fertility as a vital sign (alongside body temp, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pain) and views infertility through a holistic lens rather than treating it as an isolated condition.\n\nAt Ferta (formerly Akhanda), we’re implementing this approach firsthand. When we integrate functional medicine diagnostics with traditional fertility care, we're not just putting a bandaid on infertility– instead, we focus on optimizing and balancing the entire body because a balanced body is a fertile body. The results, of course, validate this approach. Patients who address root causes often restore natural fertility without requiring intensive interventions.\n\nThe future of fertility care isn't about choosing between functional and traditional medicine – it's about leveraging both. The next wave of innovation will come from understanding the complex interplay between metabolic health, hormonal balance, and reproductive function.\n\nWhat's your experience with fertility care? How do you see functional medicine shaping the future of reproductive health?\n\n#FertilityCare #FunctionalMedicine #HealthcareInnovation #FertaHealth",

Strong technical skills and a passion for learning\n\nLuckily, most of your existing technical skills are transferable. For eg., smart contracts are mostly written in Solidity, which is similar to mainstream programming languages (with some restrictions). For the Dapp front-end, you will be using the same tech that's used to build modern front-end apps.\n\nAlso, Ethereum and blockchain are vast. It is important that you have a passion for learning because the learning never ends.\n\n#TWO. The willingness to learn new and unfamiliar things\n\nDeveloping on Ethereum requires you to learn the new and unfamiliar decentralized architecture of Web 3.0. To be a successful Dapp developer, you have to be willing to be a beginner again.\n\n#THREE. The willingness to unlearn the practices of Web 2.0\n\nUnlearning allows you to be open to accepting new information, especially when it contradicts what you already know. Learning how to build Dapps will require unlearning some of your Web 2.0 skills and relearning how to build things the Web 3.0 way.\n\n#FOUR. The ability to work well with others\n\nSuccessfully developing a Dapp requires a mix of skills, including backend development, frontend development, distributed systems, token economics, marketing, fundraising, and politics. It is important that you be able to work well with others so that you can build a multi-faceted team.\n\n#FIVE. The readiness for an intense, long-term commitment\n\nBlockchains are fairly new technologies that have a lot of unexplored and uncertain parts to them. As a Dapp Developer, you will undoubtedly run into many unforeseen challenges. It is important that you have the determination and perserverance to overcome them.\n\nIf you have these skills (or are willing to learn them), then I can help you become a Dapp developer.

I committed multiple hours a day to understand what all the fuss is about...\n\nAnd now I want to help you understand the fuss — without the commitment of multiple hours. \n\nSo, everyday, for the next 30 days, I will answer any questions you have on #CRYPTOCURRENCIES in a simple and easy format.\n\nEach video will be 140-seconds only, occasionally longer.\n\nAsk your questions below - I’ll pick one question to answer each day!\n\nPsst...

But they are fundamentally different on the inside. Shame is inflicted onto you by others. Guilt is inflicted onto you by yourself.

Importantly, this database doesn’t require any central authority to maintain and secure it. Instead it operates as a “trustless” transactional system — a framework in which individuals can make peer-to-peer transactions without needing to trust a third party OR one another.\n\nStill confused?\n\nWell, good news!

We've already been in full lockdown for more than 2 months, and the effects of this on the economy have already been detrimental. The Peruvian government is doing almost nothing to help, and to make things worse, they recently announced that they were extending the quarantine for 1 more full month.\n \nThe indigenous wisdomkeepers have been hit the hardest, especially the high-mountain communities that live too high in elevation for substantial agriculture to grow. Many of them have ZERO economic activity during this time and are literally starving. It has been incredibly heartbreaking to witness. \n\nPlease support with even $1 if you can spare it, otherwise it's a huge help to help get the word out.\nThank you so much! 🙏🏼❤️\n\nGofundme: https://lnkd.in/gHcbasc",

For people who use off-the-shelf chat interfaces, convenience always wins. ChatGPT had web access; Claude didn’t.\n\nNew day, new tech. Anthropic has finally given Claude what it’s been missing: the ability to search the web. This may seem like a minor feature update, but it’s not—it’s huge.\n\nIf you’re a paid Claude 3.7 Sonnet user, go to your profile settings and toggle on “web search.” It’s that simple. When Claude uses web search, it provides inline citations, allowing users to verify sources and dig deeper if needed. This brings Claude to feature parity with competitors like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral’s Le Chat.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, Anthropic’s AI products are exceptional, and their models are always in the consideration set. But for normal people (non-engineers), the lack of web access added too much friction to the process.\n\nIt’s going to be interesting to see (as the word gets out) if Anthropic gets an MAU bump. I’ve already changed my keyboard shortcuts. We’ll see how long it takes ChatGPT to win back its place. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3d ago": "On March 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that works generated solely by AI without human involvement are not eligible for copyright protection under U.S. law.\n\nThe case involved computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who developed an AI system known as the “Creativity Machine.” This AI autonomously produced a piece of visual art titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise.” Thaler sought to register the artwork with the U.S. Copyright Office, listing the Creativity Machine as the author and himself as the owner. The Copyright Office denied the application, citing its policy that copyrightable works require human authorship. Thaler challenged this decision in federal court, but both the district court and the appellate court upheld the Copyright Office’s stance.\n\nThe appellate court’s opinion emphasized that the Copyright Act of 1976 implies human authorship as a prerequisite for copyright eligibility. The court noted that many provisions of the Act, such as those concerning the author’s life span and the transfer of rights upon death, inherently apply to human creators. Consequently, the court concluded that non-human entities, including AI systems, cannot be recognized as authors under current copyright law.\n\nThis ruling carries significant business implications. Under current law, content produced entirely by AI immediately enters the public domain, allowing unrestricted commercial use. However, if human creators provide meaningful input or demonstrable control over AI-generated output, copyright protection may still apply. The court offered minimal clarity on defining “meaningful input” or “control,” leaving substantial ambiguity.\n\nThis issue is far from settled. Additional cases are pending, and congressional intervention remains possible. For now, meticulously documenting human contributions to AI-driven projects is essential. Clear documentation may safeguard your company’s intellectual property—and could transform your human-AI collaborations into strategic revenue opportunities. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4d ago": "Last week, Google and OpenAI asked the White House for permission to train AI on copyrighted content, arguing that restrictive laws will cripple U.S. innovation while China advances unchecked. Their case: AI doesn’t copy; it learns patterns and creates something new. That’s fair use, they claim—the same principle that powers search engines and chatbots.\n\nHollywood disagrees. Yesterday, 400+ industry leaders—including Ron Howard, Cate Blanchett, Paul McCartney—sent a letter warning that this would open the floodgates to unlicensed use of scripts, music, and books. \n\nUnrestricted AI training could accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, automation, and more, but if creators aren’t compensated, what’s their incentive to keep creating? Given Big Tech’s market caps, the idea that they can’t afford to pay creatives is absurd.\n\nIf AI can generate a mash-up like “a painting of a farmhouse mixing the styles of Yayoi Kusama and Tetsuya Nomura” or “music for a chase scene that sounds like Hans Zimmer’s Pirates score,” shouldn’t the referenced artists get paid?\n\nWe need a licensing model, a performing rights society for AI, or an opt-in dataset. This isn’t an either-or—we can win the AI race and fairly compensate creators. In practice, we have to. -s",

It was the epoch of personalization, it was the epoch of lost discovery. It was the season of AI-driven clarity, it was the season of algorithmic opacity. It was the spring of conversational commerce, it was the winter of ten blue links.\n\nAccording to Adobe Analytics, U.S. retail websites saw a 1,200% increase in traffic from generative AI sources between July 2024 and February 2025. During the 2024 holiday season alone, this figure jumped 1,300% year-over-year, with Cyber Monday traffic spiking 1,950% compared to 2023.\n\nConsumer adoption is driving the shift. A survey of 5,000 U.S. shoppers found that 39% have used generative AI for online shopping, with 53% planning to do so this year. Users rely on AI for product research (55%), recommendations (47%), deal-hunting (43%), gift ideas (35%), product discovery (35%), and shopping list creation (33%).\n\nAI-generated traffic isn’t just growing—it’s more engaged than traditional sources. Visitors spend 8% more time on-site, view 12% more pages per visit, and have a 23% lower bounce rate than those from search or social media. Conversational AI interfaces are improving consumer confidence and making online shopping more intuitive.\n\nThat said, conversion rates for AI-driven traffic still lag behind traditional sources by 9%, but the gap is closing. In July 2024, the difference was 43%, signaling growing consumer trust in AI-assisted purchases.\n\nAnother key insight: AI-assisted shopping is happening on desktops, not mobile. Between November 2024 and February 2025, 86% of AI-driven traffic came from desktop users—suggesting that consumers prefer larger screens for complex, AI-guided shopping experiences.\n\nWhile the numbers are compelling, they only hint at what’s coming. AI-driven agents won’t just assist shoppers—they’ll shop for them. The way consumers find, evaluate, and purchase products is shifting fast, and this data is just beginning to tell the story. -s",

AI-powered robotics will reshape labor markets, home assistance, and personal productivity in ways that seem like science fiction today. The combination of increasingly powerful AI models, advanced dexterity, and multi-modal learning is bringing robots out of the factory and into everyday life. Some of the world’s most talented engineers are working on this problem, and the breakthroughs are coming fast.\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s latest project, Gemini Robotics, is a step toward that future. Built on the Gemini 2.0 platform, these AI models integrate vision, language, and action, allowing robots to perform complex physical tasks without extensive pre-programming. Demonstrations show robots folding paper, unscrewing bottle caps, and packing objects with impressive precision. The Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) model adds deeper spatial awareness and decision-making, enhancing a robot’s ability to navigate and manipulate real-world environments.\n\nDeepMind isn’t alone in this pursuit. The company is collaborating with Apptronik and testing its models with trusted robotics firms like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics. The goal is clear: make robots more capable, more useful, and ultimately, more available to businesses and consumers.\n\nFast forward a few years: your humanoid robot just picked up your dry cleaning, is prepping dinner, and tidying up the living room before your guests arrive. It’s not here yet, but the real question isn’t whether humanoid robots will go mainstream—it’s when. -s",

OpenAI’s new Responses API makes it dramatically easier to create AI agents that can search the web in real-time, analyze massive datasets, and even perform tasks directly on a computer.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with APIs (application programming interfaces), they let applications and data talk to each other. They enable automation, streamline workflows, and allow businesses to easily integrate digital capabilities.\n\nThe Responses API is designed to do more than just return AI-generated answers—it will act as a foundation for AI agents. Need an AI-powered assistant that can summarize financials? A legal research tool that can scan thousands of cases instantly? A customer service bot that pulls real-time product data instead of relying on outdated FAQs? This API makes it much faster to code.\n\nTo make implementation even easier, OpenAI also launched the Agents SDK, a toolkit that lets you orchestrate complex AI workflows across multiple agents. Instead of standalone chatbots, you can now build AI systems that work together to handle sophisticated tasks—automatically and at scale.\n\nIn short, OpenAI is giving developers the tools to make AI agents quickly and easily.

It meets every March in Beijing, and while it rarely makes headlines, this year was different—AI stole the show.\n\nDeepSeek, the Chinese startup that claims to have built a cutting-edge AI model at a fraction of the usual cost, had the NPC’s attention. Investors took notice, too. The MSCI China Index jumped 4.3% during the NPC, its best showing since 2018. According to Bloomberg, local officials scrambled to position their cities as AI hubs.

The auction was held anyway and brought in more than $728,000.\n\nThis is “the” issue for everyone with a body of work that can be found online. Every publisher, every content creator, everyone whose works can be found on the public web has contributed to the training of every foundational model. There are very few exceptions.\n\nThe primary grievance revolves around the fact that this training was done without permission or compensation, but there’s an irony here worth exploring — everyone learns their craft by studying and emulating the styles and techniques of previous craftspersons (artists, musicians, writers, and artisans alike). Traditionally, such imitation hasn’t warranted financial compensation or sparked significant protest. Competition among artists has always existed; the presence of a new competitor (AI) doesn’t fundamentally alter that reality.\n\nWhat’s distinct about AI-generated art isn’t merely competition; it’s scale and efficiency. AI can rapidly assimilate and mimic artistic styles from thousands of works in ways human artists cannot practically achieve, yet the artists signing the letter don’t typically seek royalties from human peers who study or replicate their techniques. Is the objection rooted in fear that AI-generated works might ultimately surpass human capabilities? That AI art may be more commercially desirable? Cheaper? Easier to obtain?\n\nThis debate highlights a core economic and philosophical question: Should creators be compensated for their contribution to AI training datasets, even if humans have freely studied and learned from their predecessors for centuries without explicit financial transactions? The artists’ demand is clear—they sought either cancellation of the auction or remuneration for their unintended role as AI trainers.\n\nChristie’s ignored the letter, but this issue is not going away. Everyone has very big feelings about this. I know I do. Foundational models have assimilated more than 2 million of my words and hundreds of my musical compositions from the public web. Who do I see about that? Who does anyone see? -s",

The question isn’t who will build the AI version of Google Search – the answer is obvious: Google – so our friends in Mountain View have a couple of things they’re testing.\n\nFirst, they will roll out AI Overviews, their search summary tool, globally in multiple languages (including English, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish). You’ve probably seen it – instead of a list of links, users get AI-generated summaries at the top of their search results. Publishers and eCommerce sites hate it (AI bots don’t pay royalties, click ads, or cite every source), but users seem to like it… at least when the results are accurate.\n\nThe new-new thing is called “AI Mode.” Instead of surfacing links, AI Mode delivers a full-page AI-generated response. Users can interact with the AI, ask follow-up questions, and even compare products. This mode runs on a custom Gemini 2.0 version and is currently available to Google One AI Premium subscribers. It’s super interesting, but I’m not sure it’s going to be the replacement for ten blue links.\n\nAI search is inevitable, and competitors like Perplexity and GPTSearch are rethinking the experience, but my money is still on Google.

Announced in a letter from billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, the “Voices” label applies not only to opinion pieces but also to news commentary, criticism, and reviews. Some articles will also include AI-generated “Insights,” which summarize key points and present alternative viewpoints.\n\n“We don’t think this approach—AI-generated analysis unvetted by editorial staff—will do much to enhance trust in the media,” said Matt Hamilton, vice chair of the LA Times Guild, in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nEarly results have raised concerns. The Guardian highlighted an LA Times opinion piece about AI-generated historical documentaries, where the AI tool claimed the article had a “Center Left” bias and suggested that AI “democratizes historical storytelling.” Another flagged article covered California cities that elected Ku Klux Klan members in the 1920s. The AI-generated “counterpoint” stated that some historical accounts framed the Klan as a cultural response to societal change rather than a hate-driven movement—an accurate historical note, but awkwardly positioned as an opposing view.\n\nAI-generated editorial oversight has led to similar missteps elsewhere. Microsoft’s AI-powered news aggregator once recommended an Ottawa food bank as a tourist lunch spot. Gizmodo’s AI-produced article listing Star Wars films in “chronological order” failed to follow chronology. Apple recently adjusted its Apple Intelligence summaries after a garbled AI-generated notification falsely suggested a CEO shooting suspect had shot himself.\n\nMajor outlets like Bloomberg, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Washington Post use AI in their operations, but few trust it with editorial judgments. The LA Times’ rollout should have remained an experiment. Regardless of AI, no business leader should allow unvetted content to be published under their brand—especially a news organization. -s",

OpenAI says the model offers substantial enhancements over its predecessors, particularly in advanced reasoning, problem-solving, and contextual understanding.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, improvements include: superior capabilities in handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks with increased accuracy and efficiency; enhanced creativity and flexibility; and adeptly managing intricate logic problems and maintaining nuanced, multi-turn conversations with improved contextual recall. Additionally, the model is said to integrate real-time information more seamlessly, dynamically processing and incorporating new data into its responses. The company also claims that safety measures have been bolstered, with GPT-4.5 showing a heightened ability to interpret instructions accurately while adhering to ethical guidelines.\n\nOpenAI estimates that GPT-4.5 is at least 30 times more expensive to run than GPT-4o. Where will the power and the chips come from? Not to worry: this is where GPT-5 will come in. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “A top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.”\n\nGPT-4.5 is available for ChatGPT Pro subscribers and developers. Paid subscribers to lower tier plans will get access next week.\n\nOpenAI’s current strategy is clear: “We believe reasoning will be a core capability of future models, and that the two approaches to scaling — pre-training and reasoning — will complement each other. As models like GPT‑4.5 become smarter and more knowledgeable through pre-training, they will serve as an even stronger foundation for reasoning and tool-using agents.”",

The company describes it as a hybrid system, blending fast responses with detailed reasoning, adjustable for tasks like quick answers or complex problem-solving. Anthropic claims this makes it versatile, avoiding the need for separate models. They say it is particularly strong in coding, with a high success rate on real-world software tasks.\n\nAlongside the model, Anthropic introduced Claude Code, a tool for developers in limited preview. The company says it can read code, edit files, and integrate with GitHub, streamlining software workflows. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is accessible across all Anthropic plans—free and paid—with deeper features reserved for subscribers. Pricing is straightforward: $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, according to the announcement.\n\nAnthropic also says it reduced the model’s tendency to sidestep questions, cutting unnecessary refusals by nearly half compared to its predecessor, based on internal tests. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is available through Anthropic’s API and platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you start working with the model is that Anthropic is trying to balance speed, reasoning, and coding proficiency—but that’s not the key takeaway. Claude 3.7 brings us closer to a world where the best developers won’t be the most technically gifted—they’ll be the ones who can clearly explain what they want to build. -s",

It sounds steep—until you stack it up against the cost of actual video production. Google DeepMind’s Jon Barron nailed it with his Avengers: Endgame comparison: that Marvel blockbuster ran $356 million, or roughly $32,000 per second. Veo 2 isn’t cranking out three-hour superhero sagas, but if the output suits your communicative goals, it’s a bargain. Barron’s right: this is priced to disrupt, not to gouge.\n\nI think this pricing model is temporary. The AI video space is heating up fast—new tools from rival model builders are lurking around the corner, promising more options and downward pressure on prices. Google’s betting on Veo 2’s quality and precision to justify the per-second model. At the moment, they’re right. Veo 2 makes every other text-to-video engine seem like you’re using Stone Age tools to make cave paintings.\n\nWe’re heading toward a world where creative speed and cost redefine what’s possible.

It’s not just noise; it’s a calculated exploit of scale, prioritizing volume over value. According to an investigation by 404 Media earlier this month, the problem has hit public libraries, prompting action from Hoopla, a major eBook provider.\n\nThe exposé uncovered hundreds of AI-made titles—like IRB Media’s 600+ summaries—clogging Hoopla’s catalog, misusing public funds and taxing librarians. Hoopla’s fix: purge the slop, tighten curation, and offer libraries an opt-out for AI-tagged content. The problem isn’t new or confined to eBooks—Amazon’s KDP capped uploads at three titles daily back in 2023 and websites are drowning in AI-generated articles and clickbait, diluting search results and user trust. All are reacting to a clear trend: AI’s low barrier to entry is overwhelming ecosystems built on quality.\n\nThe stakes are high. Readers lose time, authentic authors lose visibility, and curation crumbles. Hard stats on slop’s scale are scarce, but its impact isn’t. Hoopla’s cull helps, but it’s a patch, not a plan. Platforms thrive on volume, not vetting. AI tools fuel the flood unchecked. We need smarter filters—labeling, detection, something—to safeguard quality. -s",

This capability promises to tackle computational challenges—like molecular modeling or cryptography—that overwhelm traditional systems.\n\nMicrosoft took a significant step on Wednesday unveiling Majorana 1: a quantum chip that the company claims required inventing a new topological state of matter.\n\nMajorana 1 features eight topological qubits, constructed from indium arsenide and aluminum, with materials aligned atom-by-atom, as detailed in a new Nature journal paper. Jason Zander, Microsoft EVP, said this research milestone – not destined for Azure cloud – is focused on creating a future million-qubit model. For now, Microsoft will collaborate with national labs and universities, with Zander noting a few hundred qubits are needed before commercial viability discussions begin. Today, Azure Quantum offers access to IonQ and Rigetti chips, with some future chip (based on the Majorana research) potentially joining by 2030.\n\nWhile IonQ and Rigetti race to cash in on quantum hype—their $14.8 million in revenue sounds adorable next to Microsoft’s $13 billion AI juggernaut—Majorana 1 quietly stakes its claim on the frontier of physics itself. Twenty years of research, a new state of matter, and a chip that’s “not for you.” That’s not a product launch; it’s a declaration. Get ready. When quantum scales, we’re not just going to compute millions of times faster—we’re stepping into a realm where the future won’t just arrive; it will superimpose itself on today. -s",

Murati will serve as CEO, leveraging her experience as a key architect of ChatGPT during her tenure at OpenAI from June 2018 until her abrupt exit in September 2024.\n\nThe startup’s mission centers on AI alignment: a process to ensure models are safe, reliable, and reflective of human ethics.

Access begins today for premium X platform subscribers in the U.S. and via a separate subscription for Grok’s web and app versions. The model runs on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, now upgraded to 200,000 Nvidia GPUs (from its prior 100,000), used to process training data.\n\nGrok 3 underwent testing on standardized benchmarks in mathematics, science, and coding, with xAI reporting higher scores than OpenAI’s o1, DeepSeek V3, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude models. (These results are in the process of being verified by third parties.) Training included synthetic data, enabling the model to adjust outputs for logical consistency. A new feature, “Deep Search,” integrates with Grok 3 as a search engine focused on contextual accuracy. During an X-streamed demonstration, xAI founder Elon Musk noted that the model remains in beta, with updates planned daily and a voice assistant addition scheduled later.\n\nCompetition in AI development is fierce. OpenAI, co-founded by Musk in 2015 before his departure, released OpenAI o1 in September 2024, emphasizing reasoning tasks. DeepSeek, a Chinese firm, released an open-source model matching o1’s performance, supposedly achieved with less computational power despite U.S. restrictions on Nvidia GPU exports to China. xAI’s GPU cluster expansion aligns with its training needs for Grok 3’s neural network architecture.\n\nxAI says Grok 3 offers practical utility. Its benchmark performance suggests reliability for data analysis tasks like supply chain logistics or market trend forecasting. According to Musk, the Colossus infrastructure – among the largest GPU clusters globally – supports the model’s capacity to handle large datasets. The company says integration with X will provide access to real-time data streams that are relevant for business intelligence applications.\n\nWe are currently testing the model and will report what we find. There are some who say that there is no moat for foundational model builders. If there is one, I think it’s filled to the brim with money. Nvidia H100 GPUs cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each. Even with Elon’s discount—who pays retail when you’re colonizing Mars?—it’s still a $3-to-$5 billion investment in brute-force compute. It may not be a deep moat, but it’s the kind of shallow puddle that drowns startups while Musk does cannonballs off the high dive. -s",

Shortly after it launched, YouTube changed the way we consumed video. It grew powerful in tandem with the evolution of smartphones as it redefined our video viewing experiences. Now, YouTube has transcended its original form factors to officially become a television-first platform. CEO Neal Mohan revealed that viewers now watch more than 1 billion hours of content on their TVs every day, surpassing mobile viewing. For the past two years, YouTube has been the most-watched streaming service in the U.S., according to Nielsen.\n\nThe shift toward TV screens is no accident. YouTube has redesigned its TV app to function more like a traditional streaming service. Users can now pull up video comments and descriptions alongside playback, navigate episodic content through seasonal organization, and use the Watch With feature for real-time commentary on live events.\n\nMohan emphasized that today’s television experience isn’t limited to legacy programming. “The ‘new’ television doesn’t look like the ‘old’ television,” he wrote, highlighting how YouTube Shorts, podcasts, and live streams are now watched alongside sports, sitcoms, and talk shows.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube’s paid services continue to expand. YouTube TV now has more than 8 million subscribers, and YouTube Premium and Music subscriptions have surpassed 100 million (including trials). Mohan says YouTube will enhance features like Key Plays and multiview for YouTube TV subscribers while adding new perks for YouTube Premium users.\n\nYouTube is also making significant AI-driven updates. Auto-dubbing—a tool that generates translated audio tracks—has expanded to hundreds of thousands of channels, making content accessible in multiple languages, including French, German, Hindi, and Japanese.

In other words: if you don’t use it, you lose it.\n\nResearchers surveyed 319 knowledge workers across 936 AI-assisted tasks and found a troubling trend: the more users trusted AI-generated outputs, the less cognitive effort they applied. Said differently, confidence in AI correlates with diminished analytical engagement.\n\nThis is a textbook example of the automation paradox—offloading cognitive tasks to AI can make humans worse at them. Participants who blindly accepted AI’s suggestions reported weaker critical thinking skills, while skeptics remained more analytical, actively refining AI-generated content.\n\nAnother key finding: AI-assisted work tends to be more homogenous. Instead of injecting personal insight, many users defaulted to AI-generated solutions, especially under time pressure. Workers in high-stakes roles were more likely to scrutinize AI output, but those facing tight deadlines let AI take the wheel. This is one of my biggest concerns—AI-driven homogeneity could fast-track us to monoculture.\n\nOf course, fears about technology making us dumber aren’t new—writing, calculators, and the internet faced similar skepticism. The researchers suggest AI tools could be designed to foster critical thinking, offering explanations, prompting refinements, and incorporating guided critiques. They could… but they won’t.\n\nThe key takeaway? If you outsource your brain to AI, it may forget how to prompt. -s",

Their model, s1, rivals OpenAI’s o1 and DeepSeek’s R1 in math and coding benchmarks, raising serious questions about AI commoditization.\n\nNow available on GitHub, s1 was distilled from Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. Distillation—a technique that extracts reasoning capabilities from a more powerful AI by training on its outputs—is proving to be a cost-effective way to replicate cutting-edge AI. Last month, Berkeley researchers used a similar process to build a competing model for just $450.\n\nUnlike large-scale reinforcement learning, s1’s creators used supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of just 1,000 carefully curated questions. The training—running on 16 Nvidia H100 GPUs—took less than 30 minutes. Stanford researcher Niklas Muennighoff estimates that renting that compute today would cost about $20.\n\nThis raises an unavoidable question: If advanced AI models can be cloned for pocket change, is there a moat for AI giants investing billions? OpenAI has already accused DeepSeek of harvesting its API data for model distillation—which is ironic, considering OpenAI scraped the entire public web without permission. Meanwhile, Google provides free access to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental via AI Studio, but prohibits reverse engineering for competitive use.\n\nFraming AI’s future as a choice between algorithmic efficiency and brute force compute is a false dichotomy—AI’s future will require both.

But that was nine years ago, and Alexa hasn’t progressed much since.\n\nAmazon knows this better than anyone. With Alexa Voice Services embedded in more than half a billion devices, the service is underutilized and unprofitable.\n\nAccording to Amazon, this will all change on February 26 when they announce a revamped, generative-AI-powered Alexa designed to engage in multi-turn conversations and act on behalf of users – a major leap from the current version, which handles only single requests.\n\nExecutives will hold a final “Go/No-Go” meeting on February 14 to determine if the AI-powered Alexa is ready for launch. Initially, the new service will be rolled out to a limited number of users for free, though Amazon has considered a subscription fee of $5 to $10 per month. The company will continue offering “Classic Alexa,” but has halted new feature additions to that version.\n\nThe new Alexa integrates AI technology from Anthropic, an AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. Despite delays due to concerns over response accuracy and speed, Amazon expects the AI-powered assistant to enhance daily tasks, from scheduling to shopping. Analysts at Bank of America estimate that if just 10% of active Alexa users subscribe at $5 per month, the service could generate $600 million annually.\n\nIf successful, the generative AI upgrade should reposition Alexa as a key player in AI-driven personal assistants.\n\nKnock, knock.

Hackers and hobbyists have attempted to exploit AI systems using encoded messages, misleading prompts, or roleplaying scenarios to get around ethical and legal safeguards. For enterprises deploying AI, this poses serious risks—from regulatory and compliance violations to reputational damage and worse.\n\nAnthropic, the AI research company behind the Claude family of LLMs, has launched a public test of its new Constitutional Classifier, a system designed to block jailbreaks that circumvent content restrictions. The test follows an extensive internal bug bounty program, where 183 security researchers spent more than 3,000 hours attempting to bypass the system—with limited success.\n\nThe classifier builds on Anthropic’s Constitutional AI, which uses a natural language constitution to define acceptable and unacceptable content. The system employs synthetic prompts to train against known jailbreak techniques, such as embedding harmful queries in benign-looking text, roleplay scenarios, or encoded language.\n\nDuring internal testing, the classifier successfully blocked 95% of 10,000 synthetic jailbreak attempts, compared to just 14% for an unprotected Claude model. However, the system carries a 23.7% computational overhead, increasing costs and energy consumption. It also mistakenly rejects 0.38% of safe queries, a tradeoff Anthropic deems acceptable.\n\nDespite these advancements, Anthropic acknowledges that no AI safety system is foolproof. The company expects new jailbreak methods to emerge but claims its classifier can quickly adapt to novel threats.\n\nFrom now until February 10, Anthropic is inviting the public to test its defenses by attempting to bypass the class prompt Claude into generating restricted content on chemical weapons.

OpenAI plans to expand access to Plus, Team, and Enterprise subscribers soon, with higher query limits in the works. Initially web-only, mobile and desktop integration is expected later this month.\n\nThe Accuracy Question\n\nAI-generated content is notorious for hallucinations (fabricated information presented as fact). OpenAI claims to have mitigated this risk by using a specialized version of its o3 reasoning model, optimized for web browsing and data analysis. This model can parse large volumes of text, images, and PDFs, pivot in real time as it uncovers new information, and even generate and cite graphs.\n\nIn OpenAI’s internal testing, the model scored 26.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam: a deliberately difficult benchmark for AI research accuracy. While that might seem unimpressive at first glance, it outperformed Google’s Gemini Thinking (6.2%), X’s Grok-2 (3.8%), and even OpenAI’s own GPT-4o (3.3%).\n\nThe Real Test: User Behavior\n\nThe success of Deep Research won’t just hinge on accuracy—it will depend on whether users actually verify its findings. A well-cited AI response is great in theory, but if people blindly copy-paste without cross-checking sources, misinformation risks remain.\n\nAdding an ironic twist, OpenAI’s announcement comes just weeks after Google introduced an AI research feature with the exact same name.\n\nWhether ChatGPT Deep Research lives up to its promise – or simply becomes another overhyped AI feature – remains to be seen. But for now, OpenAI is doubling down on its vision of AI as a research assistant, not just a chatbot. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "ChatGPT became available to the public on November 30, 2022. I’ve given that date a name: the Curation/Generation AI Boundary (C/G Boundary). The C/G Boundary marks the transition from a time when AI was predominantly used to curate and organize preexisting content to a period characterized by AI’s capability to autonomously generate content and solutions. Prior to the C/G Boundary, any content you found on the public web had a 99 percent chance of being created by (or with the heavy hand of) a human. Each day after the C/G Boundary, a time we can call the Generative Era (GE), you are less and less likely to find content solely written by a human being.\n\nWe are about 2.5 years into the GE, and one thing is clear: humans are no longer the sole writers of human history.\n\nWith that in mind, the Authors Guild – the nation’s oldest and largest professional organization for published writers – has launched the Human Authored Certification, which allows an author to certify that their book is created by a human. “Human Authored” means that the text of the book was written by a human and not generated by AI, with the exception of minimal or trivial uses (such as AI applications that check spelling and grammar or for brainstorming or research).\n\nThe Human Authored Certification is currently available exclusively to the 15,000 members of the Authors Guild. It applies to books written by a single author, with plans to expand the program to include works by multiple authors and non-Guild members in the future.\n\nAccording to guild CEO Mary Rasenberger, “The Human Authored initiative isn’t about rejecting technology — it’s about creating transparency, acknowledging the reader’s desire for human connection, and celebrating the uniquely human elements of storytelling.” She added: “Authors can still qualify if they use AI as a tool for spell-checking or research, but the certification connotes that the literary expression itself, with the unique human voice that every author brings to their writing, emanated from the human intellect.”\n\nI’m not sure how I feel about this. “Human Authored” is not a quality certification; it’s a verification of human authorship. While it may assure readers that the content was crafted by a human, it doesn’t necessarily speak to the work’s literary merit or quality.\n\nWhat do you think about this? -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "The U.S. Copyright Office’s latest report, Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, Part 2: Copyrightability, provides critical insight into how AI-generated works fit—or don’t fit—within existing copyright law. The key takeaway is clear: for a work to be eligible for copyright protection, it must demonstrate human authorship. AI can be used as a tool, much like a camera or a digital editing program, but the final output must be shaped by human creativity to qualify for protection.\n\n“After considering the extensive public comments and the current state of technological development, our conclusions turn on the centrality of human creativity to copyright,” said Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. “Where that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection. Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine, however, would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright.”\n\nThe report reinforces the longstanding principle that copyright is designed to protect human creativity, not machine-generated content. This means that if an AI system independently generates an artwork, a piece of music, or a written work without meaningful human input, it is not copyrightable. However, if a human exercises creative control over an AI tool—such as selecting inputs, editing outputs, or structuring the composition in a way that reflects personal expression—the resulting work may qualify for copyright protection.\n\nThis ruling has broad implications for industries that rely on AI to generate content, including publishing, music, design, and film production. Creators who incorporate AI into their workflows must ensure that they actively contribute to the final creative expression if they wish to secure copyright protection. This could mean curating datasets, fine-tuning prompts, or making substantial modifications to AI-generated outputs.\n\nFor businesses, this means rethinking AI-driven content strategies. Fully automated content may not be protectable under copyright law, potentially impacting ownership rights and monetization strategies. On the other hand, companies that blend human creativity with AI assistance could maintain strong legal claims to their intellectual property.\n\nAs generative AI tools become more sophisticated, expect ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny. The Copyright Office’s stance suggests that future policy will likely continue to emphasize human authorship as the foundation of copyright protection. This raises important questions: How much human involvement is enough? Could AI-generated content be protected under alternative legal frameworks, such as database rights or contractual agreements?\n\nFor now, businesses and creators using AI should take a cautious and strategic approach—ensuring human authorship is at the core of their creative process to secure legal protection. -s",

Previously Android-only, the service works where there’s no traditional cell signal. It’s just text for now, but voice and data are coming soon.\n\nFor now, the T-Mobile-Apple-Starlink system is in a limited beta and only available in the U.S. Apple already works with Globalstar for emergency satellite messaging, so this system gives iPhones two ways to bypass the need for a carrier connection. This raises a question: When Starlink reaches a critical mass of satellites, will traditional carriers become optional?\n\nAt the moment, the need for these partnerships is not solely due to the current number of satellites but also involves regulatory considerations and the desire to provide a comprehensive and reliable service. By partnering with established carriers, Starlink can leverage existing infrastructure and spectrum allocations, facilitating a more efficient rollout of its services. While expanding the satellite constellation is a priority, partnerships with carriers will continue to be a component of Starlink’s strategy – at least for now. -s",

Then, on January 20, DeepSeek-R1 launched, and it only took a couple of days to realize the game had changed. I explained what was going to happen in my Sunday essay, then simply reported on what some are calling our “AI Sputnik Moment” yesterday.\n\nWhy the history lesson? Because everyone should have known this was coming. To be very clear, it’s going to keep happening. We are living on the exponential. The cost ratio of OpenAI to DeepSeek is a pretty clear example of what an exponential shift in cost looks like.\n\nHere are some questions to consider. Beyond reacting to Wall Street’s “DeepSeek moment,” how will you take proactive steps to ensure your organization is prepared for the next exponential leap? Have you reached out to your AI vendors to discuss their roadmap for integrating models like DeepSeek-R1 or to explore cost-saving opportunities with localized deployments? Are you evaluating which of your workflows could benefit most from lightweight, on-premise AI models or even lighter-weight mobile-friendly models? Have you convened your leadership team to assess whether your organization’s infrastructure and processes are agile enough to keep pace with rapid advancements? Are you actively fostering a culture of continuous adaptability? What specific actions will you take today to position your organization for what comes next? Food for thought. -s",

In short: DeepSeek-R1, an open-source AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek, has shaken up the industry by delivering performance comparable to leading models like OpenAI’s reasoning engine o1, its LLM GPT-4, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet while operating at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough has sparked a debate: is DeepSeek-R1 a preview of a future driven by algorithmic efficiency or an outlier that reinforces the dominance of brute force foundational models?\n\nBy today’s opening bell, the U.S. stock reacted (as markets do) to its interpretation of the issue. At the time of this writing, major technology stocks are facing substantial declines. Nvidia’s shares have dropped nearly 12%, reflecting apprehensions about the sustainability of U.S. dominance in AI. Other tech giants (including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet) have also seen their stocks fall by approximately 3% in pre-market trading. The Nasdaq 100 index has decreased by 2.8% and the S&P 500 is down by 1.7%.\n\nFinancial pundits are saying that investors are beginning to question the substantial capital expenditures by U.S. firms in AI research, given DeepSeek’s cost-effective approach. Importantly, I am not a financial advisor, and nothing in this article should be considered financial advice. If you are considering any type of investment, you should conduct your own research and, if necessary, seek the advice of a licensed financial advisor.\n\nThat said, anyone who believes that they understand the future of AI (or its future computational requirements) is delusional. As with all things, the future will be a combination of every technique. Everything we know about hardware and software tells us that incremental improvement always includes a combination of algorithmic efficiency and increased hardware capabilities. People who sold their shares today believing that we’ve “reached the end” of hardware will get what they signed up for. That’s how markets work. -s",

Available initially to U.S. users on ChatGPT’s $200 Pro plan, Operator is positioned as OpenAI’s first major step toward realizing the promise of AI agents. Expansion to other user tiers and international markets is planned, though CEO Sam Altman noted Europe’s rollout would face delays.\n\nOperator’s functionality includes booking travel, making reservations, and shopping online. It operates through a Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, leveraging GPT-4o’s vision capabilities combined with advanced reasoning. Unlike conventional API-based agents, the CUA interacts directly with website interfaces—clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating menus like a human.\n\nSafety and user control remain priorities. Operator asks for confirmation before finalizing tasks (such as submitting orders) and requires user supervision for sensitive actions (like entering payment details). OpenAI emphasizes that Operator doesn’t collect or screenshot user data, with safeguards in place to mitigate risks like phishing and malicious prompts.\n\nOperator is not without limitations, however. It struggles with complex tasks, specialized systems, and CAPTCHAs, often requiring user intervention. Certain capabilities (like sending emails or handling banking transactions) are restricted during this research preview. Daily rate limits further cap usage. OpenAI’s cautious approach reflects concerns over potential misuse, such as automating phishing scams or exploiting ticketing systems.\n\nThe agentic landscape is getting crowded. All of the foundational model builders (and an uncountable number of startups) are trying to give AI tech stacks “agency.” It’s easy to understand the allure – who wouldn’t want to get what they want at the press of a button? – but get ready because the moment a baseline standard for agentic AI is agreed upon, everything we know about search, ecommerce, marketing, SEO, and the fundamental notion of browsing the web will change. -s",

Announced at a White House press conference, the project is backed by prominent figures such as Masayoshi Son, Sam Altman, and Larry Ellison, alongside President Donald Trump. The initiative will establish cutting-edge AI infrastructure across the United States, with the initial buildout commencing in Texas.\n\nThe Stargate Project is supported by a consortium of tech giants, including Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI. These companies are not only providing technological expertise but also significant financial backing. Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI are set to collaborate closely in the construction and operation of the new computing systems, ensuring that the infrastructure meets the demands of advanced AI applications.\n\nMicrosoft has reaffirmed its commitment to its partnership with OpenAI, extending key elements of their agreement through 2030. This includes access to OpenAI’s intellectual property, revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs. However, the exclusivity on new capacity is being adjusted, granting Microsoft the right of first refusal on any new capacity built by OpenAI. This strategic move underscores Microsoft’s pivotal role in supporting OpenAI’s growth and innovation.\n\nThe announcement of The Stargate Project was marked by political undertones, with Son and Altman attributing the project’s fruition to Trump’s election victory. Clearly, the new administration is pro-big tech, and big tech was quick to acknowledge this.\n\nAs for the 100,000 jobs the project is supposed to create? Some construction jobs will be created as the data centers are built, but many more (millions more) will be created as the data centers come online. We’ve never had a compute cloud like this — there’s literally no way to calculate the economic impact of this amount of AI compute. It will be massive.\n\nThere are many tech skeptics, and it has become fashionable to denigrate and vilify big tech. To me, The Stargate Project is the first step in securing the future of the U.S. economy as well as our digital and cyber security. Every business will benefit from the power and promise of AI, and – like it or not, believe it or not – warfare will be dominated by AI. Today, the U.S. has a clear lead.

The clock was ticking—until President Trump stepped in with a last-minute executive order, extending the deadline by 75 days.\n\nHere’s the situation: TikTok briefly went offline for its 170 million U.S. users as ByteDance scrambled to comply with the ruling. While the app is operational again, you won’t find it in app stores until a deal is finalized. Trump’s extension gives ByteDance a lifeline, but it comes with strings attached. The president has floated the idea of the U.S. government taking a 50% ownership stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations, a bold move aimed at resolving national security concerns while keeping the app accessible.\n\nChina, surprisingly, seems open to negotiation. This marks a pretty significant shift from its earlier stance against a forced sale. American investors may play a crucial role in bridging the gap, but time is running out. If ByteDance can’t secure a buyer—or if negotiations falter—TikTok could face another blackout in the U.S. market.\n\nWhy does this matter?

AP’s VP of Global Business Development Kristin Heitmann called it “a new revenue stream for trusted journalism.” Licensing content isn’t a new idea, but the trend reinforces the value of the content and moves away from the controversies of algorithmic scraping.\n\nIn an unrelated story, OpenAI announced it is backing Axios’s expansion into four new local markets (Pittsburgh, PA; Kansas City, MO; Boulder, CO; and Huntsville, AL) as part of a broader $10 million investment in local news. Axios Publisher Nick Johnston noted, “This funding allows us to explore how AI can augment local journalism, ensuring communities stay informed while reducing operational costs.”\n\nBoth efforts reflect a shared mission: finding a path forward for the coexistence of professional journalism and AI. Google is betting on content licensing as a model for sustainability, while OpenAI is exploring whether AI can make local journalism viable through a tool integration strategy.\n\nThe bigger question is whether these approaches address journalism’s existential crisis.

It enables users to schedule future actions and reminders, akin to Google Assistant or Siri, but with the advanced language capabilities that ChatGPT is known for. With Tasks, users can now instruct ChatGPT to perform scheduled one-time or recurring tasks, such as providing daily weather reports, sports scores, or news digests.\n\nTo use it, select the “4o with scheduled tasks” option in ChatGPT’s model picker, then type out the desired task and specify when it should be executed.

One of the most interesting announcements of the past few days was by NVIDIA. It could mark a turning point in how we interact with AI.\n\nThe company unveiled a new lineup of RTX AI PCs powered by its GeForce RTX™ 50 Series GPUs, designed to run cutting-edge generative AI models locally. Until now, deploying powerful AI required access to massive cloud infrastructure. NVIDIA says its new GPUs, built on the Blackwell architecture, make it possible to run these models directly on consumer hardware, promising faster performance, better privacy, and greater accessibility.\n\nAt the core of this innovation are NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, a suite of tools designed to simplify AI integration. These microservices enable tasks like content creation, productivity enhancements, and even building AI-powered digital humans. Combined with preconfigured AI Blueprints, they lower the barriers for developers and creators to use generative AI in low-code and no-code environments.\n\nWhy is this important? First, it decentralizes AI, reducing reliance on cloud services. For businesses, this means data stays local, addressing privacy concerns and minimizing latency. Second, it puts high-powered AI in the hands of individuals, not just enterprises. Imagine using your PC to create lifelike avatars, produce multimedia content, or automate complex workflows—all with minimal technical expertise. While these claims will face scrutiny when the products launch in February, NVIDIA is betting that local AI will transform how we work, create, and innovate.\n\nBack in the day, there were mainframe computers, and only hobbyists had personal computers.

    "Shelly Palmer's post 2mo ago": "Greetings from Las Vegas. CES 2025 officially starts tomorrow, but I’ve been here for a few days attending press conferences and scoping out the exhibit floor. As many of you know, I am a BBQ/smoker enthusiast. Last year, GE’s indoor Smoker caught my attention. This year, it’s the Brisk It Zelos 450 Smart Grill with Generative AI. Why does a smoker need Generative AI? It doesn’t. Not in any way. That said…\n\nAs I walk around the CES show floor, I can literally smell the paint drying on the letters “AI” from booth to booth. The Brisk It grill takes this to another level and raises the philosophical question: When do humans benefit from AI?\n\nThe Brisk It 450 Smart Grill will not let you ruin your food. It will send you reminders and adjust the grill’s settings to ensure that you get a perfect cook. This sounds great, and it is great… if the outcome is your goal. If you’re looking for perfectly smoked brisket, AI (not generative AI, BTW) will do the trick.\n\nHowever, if the journey is your destination, AI is not only not the answer, but exactly what you don’t want. Smoking a brisket is a beloved process that requires time, attention, adult frosty beverages… long, exaggerated tales of past BBQ successes (and failures)… and a full day of wrapping, unwrapping, mopping, misting, firebox adjustments, love, and care. If the journey is your destination, AI is not going to help the process at all.\n\nJust a small philosophical ponderance at the advent of CES 2025. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 2mo ago": "The Cost of AGI: OpenAI’s Bold Restructuring Gambit\n\nOpenAI is planning to restructure as a public benefit corporation (PBC). By adopting this model, the ChatGPT-maker aims to secure the billions in funding required to advance its goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI). This structural evolution aligns OpenAI more closely with rivals like Anthropic and xAI, both of which have recently closed big financing rounds.\n\nAccording to the plan, OpenAI’s nonprofit parent will maintain a “significant interest” in the PBC through shares, potentially creating one of the wealthiest nonprofits in history. Unsurprisingly, not everyone loves this idea. Elon Musk’s ongoing legal battles with OpenAI are well-documented, and Meta’s recent appeal to California’s attorney general argues OpenAI’s restructuring plans offer limited enforceable mechanisms to ensure adherence to public good objectives.\n\nFinancial analysts note that the restructuring is pivotal for OpenAI to attract large-scale conventional equity investment. The company’s earlier hybrid model, which capped investor returns, constrained its ability to compete with better-capitalized players like Google and Amazon.\n\nIs a PBC the right approach? While the shift offers a pragmatic path to scale, the long-term impact on OpenAI’s mission remains uncertain. The ultimate test will be whether the PBC framework and governance structure can effectively balance profit motives with the public benefit in the high-stakes race to dominate the AI industry. We’ll see. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "Google Unveils Experimental Reasoning AI Model Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking\n\nGoogle has rolled out a new experimental reasoning AI model: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental – the name kind of rolls off the tip of your tongue, doesn’t it? – which is now available on its AI prototyping platform, AI Studio. Described as “best for multimodal understanding, reasoning, and coding,” the model is designed to tackle complex challenges in programming, math, and physics. It builds on the recently announced Gemini 2.0 Flash model and introduces reasoning capabilities aimed at improving AI accuracy and decision-making through self-fact-checking.\n\nReasoning models, like Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, approach problem-solving differently than traditional large language models (LLMs). Given a prompt, these models pause to consider related questions and explain their reasoning before summarizing what they believe to be the most accurate response. Jeff Dean, Chief Scientist for Google DeepMind, noted that this model was “trained to use thoughts to strengthen its reasoning,” and said the company sees promising results when increasing inference time computation—essentially giving the model more time and resources to process queries.\n\nThe trade-off? Time. Unlike conventional LLMs, reasoning models often take significantly longer to respond—sometimes seconds or even minutes.\n\nHow good is Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental compared to OpenAI o1? Forgetting all of the benchmarks and technical tests, there’s a test anyone can perform to see if a model is just a fancified LLM or a true reasoning engine: ask it how many R’s are in the word “strawberry.” An LLM, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o or Gemini 2.0) will incorrectly answer “two” because they are basically word calculators and don’t have any idea what the inputs or outputs mean. A reasoning engine, specifically OpenAI’s o1, will correctly answer “three,” ostensibly because it “reasons” through the problem to arrive at the correct answer. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental answered “two.” Oops!\n\nNot to worry, though: according to The Information, Google has more than 200 researchers working on the model.\n\nWhat’s driving this sudden surge in reasoning models? For one, traditional “brute force” scaling of generative AI – throwing more data and compute at models – is yielding diminishing returns. Reasoning models are a trendy approach to improving AI accuracy, particularly in specialized applications like multimodal problem-solving. I say “trendy” because questions remain about their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term viability. These models demand immense computing power, raising concerns about whether they can sustain their benchmark performance.\n\nThat said, reasoning engines are a step forward in AI evolution, with potential to redefine how we think about machine intelligence. But as the strawberry example shows, even the smartest systems sometimes still need to spell things out—literally. -s",

Uncle Stan from California would ring, and the whole house would scramble: “Hurry up! It’s long distance!” Calls cost money – especially beyond your area code.\n\nThen, in 1967, AT&T flipped the script with toll-free “800” numbers. Businesses could foot the bill for your call, no matter where you were dialing from. It changed business communication forever.\n\nFast forward to today: OpenAI just launched 1-800-ChatGPT. Yes, you can now chat with an AI over the phone, toll-free. In the U.S. and Canada, dial 1-800-242-8478 for up to 15 minutes of free AI conversation per month. Internationally? Hit up the same number on WhatsApp with no limits.\n\nSadly, 1-800-ChatGPT’s knowledge cuts off at January 2022. Ask about anything post-2022, and it’s like talking to someone who’s been off the grid. Users are scratching their heads, wondering about its usefulness.\n\nOpenAI calls this an experiment, nudging those seeking more up-to-date info to use the main ChatGPT service. Don’t worry: your calls won’t be used to train future AI models.\n\nAs OpenAI wraps up its “12 days of Shipmas,” it’s clear: what’s old is new again. This has really been fun. -s",

This expansion follows the initial release in October, which was limited to paid subscribers. The search function is well-integrated into ChatGPT, and it’s pretty useful.\n\nBut, ya know… when you ask the question, who’s gonna be “Google for AI search?” The answer has to be “Google.”\n\nJust last week, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, which introduced autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and task execution. If you think about AI deployment the way Google is thinking about it, Gemini 2.0 looks like Google’s preliminary answer to SearchGPT, Perplexity.ai, and everyone else trying to get into the AI-assisted search business.\n\nTo understand this, you have to think past search. No one wants to search; everyone wants to find, then act. Gemini 2.0 takes us one step closer to “agentic” AI. (Agentic is a fancy word for agency. It describes systems capable of autonomous decision-making and action execution to achieve specific goals without continuous human intervention.)\n\nGemini 2.0 features multimodal capabilities that process and generate text, images, audio, and video. Its agents, such as Project Astra and Project Mariner, can autonomously perform tasks like web navigation and user assistance, integrating seamlessly into Google’s ecosystem.\n\nWhile SearchGPT and Perplexity.ai have introduced innovative AI-driven search functionalities, Google’s Gemini 2.0 expands the horizon by embedding autonomous agents within its ecosystem, potentially redefining user expectations.\n\nGemini 2.0 looks like a strategic shift toward outcome-based search. If it works as described, it’s not only going to challenge existing search paradigms – it’s going to push everyone working on AI-assisted search to innovate. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "Google Unveils Willow: A Leap Forward in Quantum Computing\n\nGoogle Quantum AI has introduced Willow, a cutting-edge quantum chip designed to address two of the field’s most significant challenges: error correction and computational scalability. Willow, fabricated in Google’s Santa Barbara facility, achieves state-of-the-art performance, marking a pivotal step toward realizing a large-scale, commercially viable quantum computer.\n\nIt gets way geekier from here – but if you’re with me so far…\n\nExponential Error Reduction\n\nJulian Kelly, Director of Quantum Hardware at Google, emphasized Willow’s ability to exponentially reduce errors as the system scales. Utilizing a grid of superconducting qubits, Willow demonstrated a historic breakthrough in quantum error correction. By expanding arrays from 3×3 to 5×5 and then 7×7 qubits, researchers cut error rates in half with each iteration.\n\nThis achievement, referred to as being “below threshold,” signifies that larger quantum systems can now exhibit fewer errors, a challenge pursued since Peter Shor introduced quantum error correction in 1995. The chip also achieved “beyond breakeven” performance, where arrays of qubits outperformed the lifetimes of individual qubits, which is key to ensuring the feasibility of practical quantum computations.\n\nTen Septillion Years in Five Minutes\n\nWillow’s computational capabilities were validated using the Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) benchmark, a rigorous test of quantum supremacy. According to Google’s estimates, Willow completed a task in under five minutes that would take a modern supercomputer ten septillion years—a timescale exceeding the age of the universe. This achievement underscores the rapid, double-exponential performance improvements of quantum systems over classical alternatives.\n\nWhile the RCS benchmark lacks direct commercial applications, it remains a critical indicator of quantum computational power. Kelly noted that surpassing classical systems on this benchmark solidifies confidence in the broader potential of quantum technology.\n\nBuilding Toward Practical Applications\n\nGoogle’s roadmap aims to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum advantage and real-world utility. The team is now focused on achieving “useful, beyond-classical” computations that solve practical problems. Applications in drug discovery, battery design, and AI optimization are among the potential breakthroughs quantum computing could unlock.\n\nWillow’s advancements in quantum error correction and computational scalability highlight its transformative potential. As Kelly explained, “Quantum algorithms have fundamental scaling laws on their side,” making quantum computing indispensable for tasks beyond the reach of classical systems.\n\nQuantum computing is still years away, but this is an exciting milestone. Considering the remarkable rate of technological improvement we’re experiencing right now, practical quantum computing (and quantum AI) may be closer than we think. -s",

Sora enables users to generate videos from text prompts, animate images, and remix existing videos. ChatGPT Plus subscribers ($20/month) can create up to 50 priority videos at 720p, while ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) have access to unlimited video generations at 1080p. Do not be surprised if you encounter the “Sora account creation is temporarily unavailable” error message. Demand is understandably high.\n\nTo promote responsible use, all Sora-generated videos include watermarks and C2PA metadata indicating AI generation. Users must agree not to upload prohibited content. Currently, Sora is accessible in multiple countries, though its European release is delayed due to regulatory considerations. The launch follows a recent controversy where artists leaked the product in protest, accusing OpenAI of exploiting their unpaid labor during Sora’s development. This fight will continue for a very long time.\n\nHow good is Sora? It will never be worse than it is today – and today, it’s pretty good. It excels at videos where the laws of physics are suspended. In other words, animations work well because you accept that animated characters live in a universe where our laws of physics don’t apply. (Imagine a Road Runner cartoon where Wile E. Coyote runs off a cliff and continues for five steps as if the ground was still beneath him, then hangs in the air for a few seconds before falling hundreds of feet to create a Wile E. Coyote-shaped hole from which he emerges unharmed. Fun to watch, but it can’t actually happen in our universe.)\n\nWhen you ask Sora to create an imaginary cartoon world, it’s very good. On the other hand, photorealism and cinematic generation still have a way to go. Things appear and disappear for no reason. Running and legs seem to pose a problem. There are lots of artifacts and other obvious unnatural movements that you are hardwired to see, so you instantly know something isn’t quite right. But, again, this is the worst Sora will ever be.\n\nThis is a launch that will be as profound to human communication as the advent of the mobile phone camera, social media, and social video; you can call it “social production.” In more than a few months (but less than a few years), anyone who can describe a video they want to see will be able to see it (and share it).

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "Amazon Announces Nova: A New Family of Frontier Models\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) introduced Nova, a new family of multimodal AI models, at its re:Invent conference. The Nova lineup includes four text-generating models—Micro, Lite, Pro, and Premier—and two media-focused tools: Nova Canvas for image generation and Nova Reel for video creation. Here’s a brief overview.\n\nText Models: Micro, Lite, Pro, Premier\n\nThe Nova text models offer a range of capabilities tailored to different needs. Micro is the smallest, designed for rapid text-to-text generation with minimal latency. Lite expands functionality to include image and video inputs while maintaining speed. Pro provides a balance of accuracy, speed, and cost, suitable for complex workflows. Premier, available in early 2025, is intended for advanced tasks such as creating customized models, positioning it as a tool for developers and enterprises seeking scalability.\n\nThe context windows are well-sized. Micro supports up to 128,000 tokens (about 100,000 words), while Lite and Pro can handle 300,000 tokens (roughly 225,000 words, 15,000 lines of code, or about 30 minutes of video). Amazon says that Premier and future models will expand to over 2 million tokens next year.\n\nMedia Tools: Canvas and Reel\n\nAWS also launched Nova Canvas and Nova Reel to enhance its generative media capabilities. Canvas focuses on image creation and editing, including tools for background removal and color customization. Reel generates six-second video clips with options for camera motion like pans, zooms, and 360-degree rotations. Longer video generation, up to two minutes, is expected soon.\n\nBoth tools integrate content moderation features, including watermarking, to promote responsible use.\n\nLooking Ahead: Speech-to-Speech and Any-to-Any Models\n\nAWS plans to roll out a speech-to-speech model in Q1 2025, capable of interpreting tone and cadence for natural-sounding transformations. Later in 2025, an any-to-any model will support inputs and outputs across text, speech, images, and video, enabling a broad range of AI applications.\n\nIntegration and Accessibility\n\nThe Nova models and tools are available on AWS Bedrock, where customers can fine-tune them for specific tasks. AWS emphasized their speed and cost-effectiveness, with CEO Andy Jassy highlighting Nova’s utility in orchestrating agent-based workflows through proprietary APIs.\n\nAWS has not disclosed details about the data used to train the Nova models, citing competitive and legal considerations. However, customers are protected by an indemnification policy that addresses potential copyright issues stemming from the use of generative AI outputs.\n\nAll of the US-based hyperscalers are now in a foundational model arms race.

Some say DiscoBros, who own the IP, wanted it taken down. Others say Tom Riddle (who, oddly, is still there) invoked the Evanesco curse. (Ten points to Gryffindor if you’re nerdy enough to know this incantation.) I’m going with the disgruntled DiscoBros theory.\n\nAll kidding aside, this is a very interesting IP issue. J.K.

Rowling’s publishers, Bloomsbury in the UK and Scholastic in the US, possess the rights to publish the books, but do not own the underlying intellectual property.\n\nSo… who gave the order? Someone did, but that’s not the interesting part. What fascinates me is how mad this made the character.ai power users who are clearly addicted to their synthetic Harry Potter companions. @karmaismycatz posted, “Today we’re all Draco’s widows and it’s all character ai fault stupid ass app !!!” @hibyemichiko posted, “i was devastated since all my favorite HP characters had been deleted by c ai. half of my life was there 😭 so now, decided to create my own Harry Potter bot *sigh*.” There are literally thousands of very sad character.ai users being super vocal about this.\n\nThink about this… the Harry Potter franchise just shut down a completely new way to engage fans in the Harry Potter saga. These people are not just fans, they are superfans. Through the magic of generative AI, these dedicated Harry Potter lovers were able to enter into relationships with their beloved characters. You can argue that the IP owner was not directly financially benefiting from these interactions, and you could also argue that superfans do not need to be serviced (because nothing will change their superfan status), but I will argue that this is a missed opportunity to build the brand while evolving the art of storytelling in the age of generative AI. Ready for the debate? I have the tech and the stats to back up my thesis. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "Perplexed by Perplexity’s Tweet\n\nA tweet stopped me mid-scroll the other day. Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity, wrote, “Considering making a simple, under $50 hardware device, that will reliably answer your questions voice to voice. Just do this, but do it very well. If this post gets more than 5000 likes, will definitely make it.” When it surpassed that number, he posted, “Alright. LFG!” So there you have it – Perplexity is getting into the hardware business.\n\nHardware is a bit of a microtrend, as all of the cool kids seem to be working on hardware projects. Drones, humanoid robots (robots of all kinds, actually), next gen XR headgear, quantum computers, chip fab… hardware is a thing, but is it for everyone? Does having a big pile of investor money lying around give you license to dabble in hardware?\n\nThe hardware business is not all sunshine and unicorns. It’s more like the opening scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, where we meet Indiana Jones as he is navigating a dark, dangerous labyrinth filled with the scattered remains of the intrepid souls who didn’t reach the golden monkey head. He gets it! But that’s when the fun really starts: arrows, collapsing floors, and that iconic boulder determined to crush him. It’s a perfect metaphor for the tech hardware business (any new business, really).\n\nWant to see a successful AI hardware project (over 130,000 units sold) that’s failing huge? Look on eBay for a Rabbit R1. You can buy mine if you want; it’s still in the original box on the corner of my desk. It’s an AI-powered hardware device that I enthusiastically set up, tested, and promptly re-boxed. Why? Because we already have the best available AI hardware in our pockets – it’s called a smartphone. -s",

In practice, it’s easier to connect data to AI than it is to get permission to connect data to AI.\n\nThis morning, things just got a little easier. Anthropic has announced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source standard that the company says will enable AI assistants to connect seamlessly with a wide range of data sources. According to Anthropic, the protocol is designed to bridge the gap between AI systems and content repositories, business tools, and developer environments—areas where custom integrations have traditionally posed significant challenges.\n\nIf I lost you in the jargon, Anthropic claims MCP will standardize how AI models interact with external data, potentially making integrations faster and more efficient. The company suggests that this approach will enhance the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated outputs by reducing the complexity of connecting models to diverse data ecosystems.\n\nIt’s a compelling vision, but (as with any new standard) MCP’s impact will depend on how widely it’s adopted and how well it performs in real-world scenarios. For now, the idea of a universal integration protocol remains an aspirational goal for the industry. If MCP gains traction, it could mark a meaningful step toward making AI more practical and accessible for businesses and developers alike. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "AI and the New Workforce: How Millennials and Gen Z Are Redefining Leadership\n\nIf you’re between the ages of 22 and 39, congratulations—you’re apparently the chosen ones. According to new research from Google Workspace and The Harris Poll, 82% of young leaders are already leveraging AI tools in their work. The study paints a picture of rising leaders who aren’t merely drafting emails or automating tasks with AI—they’re out here making it their career coach, therapist, and maybe even their therapist’s therapist.\n\nThis demographic, sometimes awkwardly labeled “Zillennials” (half millennial, half Gen Z), isn’t just tech-savvy—they’re tech-addicted. They’ve grown up swiping their way through life, so it’s no surprise they’re leaning hard into AI. What’s fascinating is how they’re using it—not just to save time, but to look better, sound smarter, and even AI-ing their way into management.\n\nThe research is both inspiring and a little terrifying. This crowd doesn’t see AI as a threat to their jobs—it’s a shortcut to their next promotion (or next job). Apparently, while they’re automating the boring stuff, they’re also using AI to learn how to be better bosses, smarter communicators, and (allegedly) more empathetic humans. I don’t buy the more empathetic bit, BTW. (OK, Boomer.)\n\nFor businesses, this reminds me of the early days of smartphones—when apps and data were not properly orchestrated and it took way too many taps to accomplish goals using a phone. Leading-edge Millennials didn’t understand why smartphones didn’t just work. Now, they’re wondering why AI isn’t already everywhere.\n\nHistory is a pretty good teacher. Zillennials (I really hate this portmanteau) are not the future of work—they are the now. If you’re not thinking about how to align your business with their AI-powered approach to everything, you might as well start drafting your retirement speech with the LLM you have access to on your personal laptop. The rise of AI isn’t the story here—the rise of the AI-enabled leader is. They’re rewriting the rules while too many current leaders are still reading the manual. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4mo ago": "Siri Won't Suck Forever\n\nSiri can’t suck forever. You know it. I know it. Even Apple knows it. After 13 years of mediocrity, Apple is finally doing something about it. Enter “LLM Siri,” Apple’s attempt to make its assistant more like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.\n\nInternally, Apple’s engineers are working on large language models (LLMs) to enable back-and-forth conversations, smarter responses, and deeper app integrations. But don’t hold your breath—this won’t hit your devices until 2026.\n\nThe new Siri will eventually be part of Apple Intelligence, the platform the company unveiled this year with lots of hype but little substance. So far, the updates have been mostly cosmetic: a glowing interface, better command recognition, and typing options. Helpful for sure, but just lipstick on a pig. (Wait. Pigs are cute. Feel free to pick a better metaphor.)\n\nThe rumor mill says Apple’s next-gen approach will deliver ChatGPT-level sophistication, which means Apple’s North Star is “be as good as ChatGPT 2024 when Siri 2.0 launches in 2026.” Bold strategy, Cotton.\n\nIn the meantime, the fruit company is adding ChatGPT to its ecosystem next month and may integrate Google’s Gemini down the line. All kidding aside, Apple’s goal is clear: use the best of third-party tools, integrate them seamlessly, and – just when everyone thinks Apple is model-agnostic and playing nicely with others – lose the competition and bring an in-house, walled-garden, privacy-focused, AI-powered Siri to market. Savage!\n\nA lot of people think Apple is very late to the game. They are, but it doesn’t matter. If we’ve learned anything over the past few years, it’s that “distribution is king.” DemandSage says that as of October 2024, there were more than 1.56 billion active iPhones. Now, add in iPads, MacBooks, etc., and the number of Apple devices in the wild exceeds 2.2 billion. That means Apple really only needs to do one thing: get AI right. They can slow play this as long as they want. They don’t have any competition. No iOS or macOS or iPadOS user is giving up their devices because Apple hasn’t fully developed an agentic Siri. If we’re honest, the vast majority of Apple customers won’t even think about this until the benefits are unignorable. Through that lens, Apple has as much time as they need. -s",

The video, which was designed to evoke the nostalgia of the company’s 1995 “Holidays Are Coming” commercial, truly sucks. The animation is bad (by any standard) and lacks the warmth and creativity traditionally associated with Coca-Cola’s holiday campaigns. If you haven’t seen it, it kind of looks like Polar Express on bad acid. Oddly, this is not why people are mad. For some reason, people are calling out AI as the villain.\n\nThe video was created in collaboration with three AI studios—Secret Level, Silverside AI, and Wild Card—using four generative AI models. It attempted to combine tradition with innovation – and fell flat. Why did Coca-Cola release it? The execs at Coke had to know it sucked.\n\nIn a statement, a Coca-Cola spokesperson emphasized the company’s ongoing exploration of new creative approaches: “The Coca-Cola Company has celebrated a long history of capturing the magic of the holidays in content, film, events, and retail activations for decades around the globe. We are always exploring new ways to connect with consumers and experiment with different approaches. This year, we crafted films through a collaboration of human storytellers and the power of generative AI.”\n\nAwesome! It’s great to try new things. Push the envelope. Explore new creative boundaries… but there’s no reason to release a substandard product. In practice, Coke wasn’t breaking new creative ground; they were trying to use technology to reduce production costs and see if they could figure out how to save millions of dollars on what would otherwise be a multi-million dollar animation project. It turns out that in 2024… you can’t. Maybe this will be possible in 2025 or 2026, but not today.\n\nThe fact that this video was in no way ready for primetime should not have been lost on anyone – but, apparently, it was.\n\nThere are some rules you really can’t break. Know your audience. Have a North Star. Understand your vision, mission and values – and stick to them. Evaluate your work honestly. Complexity doesn’t equal quality; simplicity is often harder to achieve. Above all, start with a business outcome in mind, not a process. Coca-Cola’s goal should have been to evoke holiday joy and strengthen its emotional bond with the audience, not to “do a generative AI project.” This kind of poorly-executed AI experiment doesn’t help anyone: brands, creatives, or the tech itself. Hopefully, we can all learn from this mistake. -s",

Aside from my consulting work, I’m also the Professor of Advanced Media in Residence at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, where I teach Advanced Media Business Management in the grad school. Between that and what I do for a living, I end up talking about AI with students, teachers, and executives all the time. Not to put too fine a point on it, I am also the author of Generative AI for Brand Marketers, a free online course designed to help executives get started with AI. I guess you could say I spend a lot of time thinking about how AI fits into teaching and learning, which brings us to today’s most interesting story.\n\nOpenAI has introduced a free online course for K-12 educators, developed in collaboration with Common Sense Media. The program, ChatGPT Foundations for Educators, consists of nine modules covering AI basics, generative AI, and practical applications of ChatGPT in classrooms. According to OpenAI, early deployments in schools, including those in Arizona and California, have been well received, with 98% of participants reporting new ideas and strategies for teaching.\n\nA spokesperson from OpenAI stated, “Schools across the country are navigating the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This course is a proactive approach to help educators prepare for the transformation AI can bring to classrooms.”\n\nI completed the course last night. It’s very basic, but it’s a well-crafted starting point for K-12 teachers.\n\nDespite a generally positive reception, some educators have expressed concerns about the ethical implications of integrating AI into teaching. These include potential issues with data privacy, unclear ownership of content generated through AI tools, and the risk of over-reliance on AI in pedagogical processes. There is also skepticism about whether AI can adequately address critical teaching needs without compromising the learning experience.\n\nThese are all valid concerns, but they should not stop anyone from becoming educated about basic use of AI. Sadly, adoption of AI in education remains slow. Surveys indicate that many educators are hesitant to use AI tools, citing questions about effectiveness and ethical implications.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, many educators banned Google, extolling the virtues of library science and sending students to wrestle with card catalogs and microfilm. Today’s hand-wringing over AI is just history repeating itself. Like it or not, generative AI (and upcoming agentic systems) are the Google of this generation. Challenge them. Improve them. But if you ignore them, you’re not protecting students—you’re failing them. -s",

In just the past few months, we’ve seen Microsoft introduce Bing Generative Search, Google introduce AI Overviews, OpenAI introduce SearchGPT, and now… drumroll please… Perplexity AI has added “Buy with Pro,” where Pro subscribers ($20/month in the U.S.) can buy products directly from Perplexity’s search results. Saved billing and shipping info handles the details, and free shipping sweetens the deal. If the product isn’t supported, you’ll get kicked to the merchant’s website. (Wait. What?

Spokesperson Sara Platnick confirmed (“There’s no commercial element”), but it’s hard to ignore where this might be heading.\n\nFor non-subscribers, Perplexity has spruced up its search results with AI-generated product cards.

They were a big winner (not the winner, but let’s give credit where it’s due). What did they win? A crash course in network topology and a live case study on what it takes to deliver 60-65 million concurrent streams over the public internet. They have some homework to do. Sure, they stumbled on production value, but no one cared—that wasn’t the main event. As a bonus, they won a place in the global news cycle for several days. As you know, education is expensive; when you add it all up (purse, gate, streaming costs, production costs), this \"win\" probably cost Netflix between $75-$100 million, which is why they were not the \"big\" winner.\n\nNow, Jake Paul. Love him or hate him, the guy understands the game better than most. He didn’t just win the fight—he delivered a masterclass in social video, social media, and shameless self-promotion. In doing so, he drove the final nail into the coffin of traditional media. Streaming isn’t the future; it’s the present. Watching this completely fabricated event rake in cash and attention was like watching Monet… if Monet painted clout-chasing YouTubers. Yes, Jake got paid to beat up an old man. I'm sure he's fine with it.\n\nAnd then there’s Iron Mike Tyson. At 58, Tyson won by crushing the meta-game. He reminded us that age is just a number if you have the discipline to train like a madman for six months. Did he really win or lose? Who cares? The fight was rigged, or at least heavily choreographed, because… boxing. The outcome didn’t matter. Tyson really couldn’t lose: if he survived, he won; if he won, he really won. Win/win for Tyson.\n\nSo… what’s the real takeaway? Traditional media is officially \"out for the count,\" and no amount of nostalgia for the \"good old days\" will resurrect it. -s",

I just love this.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with YouTuber Jim Browning, this initiative is part of O2’s broader “Swerve the Scammers” campaign, which aims to combat the increasing prevalence of phone fraud. Recent data indicates that 67% of UK residents are concerned about being targeted by scams, with 22% experiencing fraudulent attempts weekly.\n\nIn what can only be described as next-level scambaiting, Daisy’s interactions with scammers involves sharing fabricated personal information and engaging in extended, irrelevant conversations – effectively wasting the fraudsters’ time. According to O2, Daisy has kept scammers on the line for up to 40 minutes.\n\nThere’s a special place in hell for phone scammers, especially those who prey on the elderly. Obviously, it would be better if phone networks could prevent bad actors from making the calls in the first place, but this is certainly the next best thing.\n\nVoice cloning is controversial, and it’s a double-edged sword. Scammers can use the exact same tech to clone real voices and trick people into thinking they are talking to family members or their boss. On that subject, I suggest a family safe word or phrase if a close friend or family member calls you with an odd request. “Hey, I’m stuck in Fresno and my car broke down.

In a post titled Why We’re Experimenting with Advertising, Perplexity outlined its approach: integrating sponsored questions crafted in collaboration with advertisers. While the questions will be labeled as sponsored, Perplexity says the answers will not be influenced by the advertiser. Instead, they will surface the paid advertisement next to the answer. The company’s blog post did not show an example of the entire experience.\n\nWhen Perplexity launched, I fell in love. It was a way to do 10 minutes of Google searches in 10 seconds. Then, over time, the service became less useful because the quality of the results varied so much, forcing me to check every answer (which defeated the purpose). I still use Perplexity for some searches, but I’ve installed the GPT Search Chrome extension and made ChatGPT Search my go-to AI-assisted search engine. Right now, I have Google and Perplexity bookmarked and I use them when needed.\n\nPerplexity says it needs ad dollars to make ends meet. I’m sure that’s true, but is this the right way to integrate advertising into AI-generated search results?\n\nIf you ask the wrong question, you’re guaranteed to get the wrong answer.\n\nGoogle is not a search engine. It is a highly specialized direct response advertising engine purpose-built to translate the value of “intention” into wealth for Google (Alphabet) shareholders. It is optimized to put the right ad in front of the right person at the right time. In other words, it is designed to optimize revenue; all other considerations are secondary.\n\nAll of the new generative AI-based search products – OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search, Google’s AI Overviews, Perplexity.ai, etc. – are actually search tools. They are not optimized for advertising; they are optimized to give you the information you are intending to find. Would anyone ever trust a sponsored paragraph of information returned from a search query? Isn’t that the definition of an advertorial? You don’t need to be a skeptic or a conspiracy theorist to instantly mistrust sponsored information; we’ve all been trained to know an ad when we see one.\n\nWhere does that leave Perplexity and the rest of the AI ad newbies who hope to eat Google’s lunch? Consumer behavior is hard to change. Old habits die hard. Choose your cliché. We’re entering an interesting era of trial and error. I’m happy to do the trial; the sociology says there’s going to be some errors. -s",

Inference, the process when an AI model generates outputs and answers, can be optimized by having models “think” through multiple possibilities before settling on a response. This approach enables complex reasoning during real-time use without increasing model size.\n\nOpenAI’s recently launched o1 model is a good example. By enhancing inference, o1 can tackle tasks that demand layered decision-making, such as coding or problem-solving, in ways similar to human thought. “Test-time compute” techniques make this possible, allowing models to dedicate more processing to challenging queries as needed.\n\nA move toward inference-focused, distributed, cloud-based servers (instead of large, centralized training clusters) might create a more competitive chip landscape. While NVIDIA is the go-to chipmaker for pre-training hardware, there are a bunch of chipmakers (AMD, Intel, etc.) that make hardware suitable for this new method of inference scaling.\n\nThe key takeaway is simple: LLMs are not failing, they are evolving.

Big thanks to Greg Stuart, his outstanding MMA team, and our presenting sponsors. Special thanks to Mark Marshall and his extraordinary team at NBCUniversal.\n\nDuring the Summit, one key topic was the pressing need for ways to control and moderate LLM output, so Mistral AI’s latest announcement is timely.\n\nThe company has launched a new moderation API, powered by its fine-tuned Ministral 8B model, designed to classify content across nine categories, including violence, self-harm, and personally identifiable information.\n\nThe tool, which underpins #Mistral’s Le Chat chatbot platform, processes both raw and conversational text in multiple languages, offering customizable moderation capabilities that align with varying safety standards.\n\nEntering a competitive space, Mistral’s API joins Jigsaw’s Perspective API and #OpenAI’s moderation API, with each addressing critical AI moderation needs but facing challenges with biases and linguistic nuances.\n\nJigsaw’s tool is known for sentiment analysis but can misclassify informal language as toxic, while OpenAI’s moderation API is valued for flexibility across applications. \n\nMistral says its solution “sets itself apart by focusing on model-generated harm reduction and cost efficiency through batch processing, cutting costs by 25% on high-volume requests with asynchronous operations.”\n\nMaking LLMs and AI tech stacks “safe for work” is extremely hard to do. If you’re not familiar with the process of post-training #LLMs and #AI tech stacks, please reach out and I’ll direct you to some resources. -s",

Normal consumers are pushing back.\n\nIn response, Microsoft is quietly pivoting its consumer AI strategy by bundling Copilot features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions across select markets after its initial strategy of offering these tools as a $20 monthly add-on struggled to gain traction.\n\nWith Copilot originally launched as a premium feature under the separate Copilot Pro plan, Microsoft found that consumers didn’t want to pay an additional fee on top of their existing subscription for access to AI tools.\n\nAccording to a press release, Microsoft is integrating Copilot directly into standard Microsoft 365 subscriptions, providing access to features across core applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. These tools offer users the ability to generate content, analyze data, enhance presentations, draft emails, and organize notes more efficiently. Microsoft Designer is also being bundled into these subscriptions, expanding creative capabilities by allowing users to generate and edit images across applications, with standalone access on the web.\n\nTo manage resource usage, Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of AI credits, with an option to upgrade to Copilot Pro for unlimited use.\n\nA few thoughts come to mind. Has Microsoft done a poor job of explaining what normal people can accomplish with Copilot? For example, automated writing suggestions and summaries in Word, formula generation in Excel, PowerPoint’s automatically structured presentations, complete with visuals and speaker notes, and Outlook’s draft emails and thread summaries. Or…\n\nDo normal people simply not benefit from all of this? Maybe none of these features (except the Excel formula functions and Outlook summaries) work well enough to justify an extra $240/year. I’m sure Microsoft will do some market research and figure it out.\n\nIn the meantime, it will be interesting to see if free works. After all, “free” is very consumer-friendly pricing. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4mo ago": "Apple has introduced a redesigned Mac mini featuring the M4 and M4 Pro chips. The entry level model, which I got to demo this past week, is going to seriously reset the balance of power in the mini PC market.\n\nIf you’re not a mini PC user (or if you’ve never thought about the mini PC format), these are small (but full-featured) PCs suitable for desktop use, school, gaming, media centers, etc. They are awesome because they are very small, quiet, fit anywhere, and basically do anything a PC can do.\n\nI don’t work for Apple, and I have no financial dog in this hunt, but if you’re in the market for a mini PC, the Mac mini is now at the top of my list. Here’s why:\n\nThe new M4 Mac mini measures 5 inches by 5 inches – a reduction from the previous 7.75-inch square footprint – and weighs 1.5 pounds. This downsizing is achieved through an innovative thermal architecture that efficiently manages airflow, allowing the device to maintain performance without overheating.\n\nIt’s equipped with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU and starts with 16GB of unified memory. Apple claims it delivers up to 1.7 times faster spreadsheet calculations in Microsoft Excel and up to 4.9 times faster panoramic image merging in Adobe Lightroom Classic (compared to the M1 model). For more demanding tasks, the M4 Pro variant offers up to a 14-core CPU and a 20-core GPU, with memory configurations up to 64GB. This model supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing and enhanced AI processing capabilities.\n\nThe M4 Mac mini includes two front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The rear panel features three Thunderbolt ports (Thunderbolt 4 on M4, Thunderbolt 5 on M4 Pro), an HDMI port, and a gigabit Ethernet port. The M4 Pro model supports up to three 6K displays or four 4K displays, enhancing its utility for professional workflows. Read that again: that’s three 6K displays or four 4K displays… four!\n\nThere is one super-quirky thing about the new M4 Mac mini: the power button is on the bottom, not the back. I have no idea why Apple thought this was a good idea. I leave my mini PCs on all the time, so it doesn’t matter to me, but a normal person – who turns their computer on and off – might care.\n\nThe base M4 Mac mini is priced at $599, while the M4 Pro model starts at $1,399. Pre-orders began last week, with availability starting this Friday. Notably, this Mac mini is Apple’s first carbon-neutral Mac, constructed with more than 50% recycled materials and produced using 100% renewable energy.\n\nOne more thing… I’m enthusiastic about the entry-level models because they are an exceptional balance of price and value. As you add features, you get into the “I can’t believe how much Apple charges for a stick of RAM” issue. At that point, good ol’ fashioned PCs start making more sense. -s",

Click it and enter your search term. Sit back and wonder about the future of link-based search, ecommerce, and the web itself.\n\nI entered this prompt: “OpenAI new search feature to compete with google and bing.” ChatGPT 4o Search returned the following few paragraphs with the citation links indicated below along with a fully clickable summary of every source article.\n\nOpenAI has introduced a search functionality within its ChatGPT platform, positioning itself as a competitor to established search engines like Google and Microsoft’s Bing. This feature enables ChatGPT to access real-time information from the web, providing users with up-to-date responses on topics such as news, sports scores, stock prices, and weather. The integration allows ChatGPT to automatically perform web searches based on user queries, delivering relevant answers accompanied by links to external sources. Reuters\n\nInitially available to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers, OpenAI plans to extend this capability to enterprise, educational, and free users in the coming months. The search function is powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, which utilizes data from third-party search providers and content from established partners. Nairametrics\n\nThis development signifies OpenAI’s strategic move into the search market, challenging Google’s long-standing dominance and Microsoft’s recent advancements with AI-integrated Bing. By embedding search capabilities directly into ChatGPT, OpenAI aims to offer a seamless experience that combines conversational AI with real-time information retrieval. The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe introduction of this feature also addresses previous limitations of ChatGPT, which was constrained by a knowledge cutoff and lacked access to current information. With the new search functionality, ChatGPT can now provide more accurate and timely responses, enhancing its utility for users seeking up-to-date information. Wired\n\nAs OpenAI continues to develop and refine this feature, it is poised to reshape the landscape of online search by integrating advanced AI capabilities into the user experience.\n\nWith all the sources cited and a gigantic list of additional sources, why am I saying it’s the end of link-based search? I didn’t need to click on anything at all. One hundred percent of the information I think I needed was summarized and provided in a format that was completely usable for my purposes.\n\nWhy am I saying, “I think” I needed? Because I have no idea what I’m looking at, and I have learned to default to distrust when reading any generative AI work product. All of the articles are summarized, which may be great… but also could be nonsense.\n\nBTW, there’s no way Google doesn’t have an answer for this.\n\nNew behavior = disruption. Buckle your seatbelt. This is going to be a wild ride. -s",

This week, Microsoft disclosed a significant increase in spending, reaching $20 billion in just the first fiscal quarter. In an earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated, “We’re going to continue investing significantly in this.” Despite these companies surpassing profit and revenue targets, their stocks (including Amazon) witnessed declines in premarket trading; Meta and Microsoft both fell by 4% and Amazon dropped 1.4%.\n\nFinancial analysts (and investors) don’t seem to understand (or care) that it’s going to cost tens of billions of dollars to build out the infrastructure required to win in AI, but the trend is clear: the AI elite have the money, and they are going to invest in the future.\n\nWhat happens on the other side of this unprecedented spending spree? It depends on who you ask. The goal for some of the tech giants is to build AI systems capable of artificial general intelligence (AGI). While there is no agreed-upon definition of AGI, one popular idea is human-level intelligence (or beyond). Another (less lofty) definition is that AGI will be an AI tech stack of reasoning engines and agents that can accomplish goals (as opposed to simple tasks). However you define AGI (and your definition is as good as anyone else’s), it’s the next level and there is a big money race to get there.\n\nWho will win? We will. In the end, the big cloud computing companies will incorporate AI into their respective cloud offerings and all of us will enjoy the benefits. That said, there is a huge dark side to all of this… but let’s leave that for another day. -s",

Their AI Copilot (powered by OpenAI) has been around for months. Now, GitHub’s Copilot is officially multi-model, supporting Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s GPT-4 variants. This shift signals the end of the “single model era,” as GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke put it. The choice, he asserts, empowers developers to match models to specific tasks, policies, languages, and personal preferences.\n\nIt’s a big strategic move for Microsoft. The introduction of Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, followed soon by Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, complements existing options like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1. Each model brings unique strengths — faster or smaller models suit low-latency needs, while complex models tackle tasks demanding high accuracy. This isn’t merely a feature add; it’s a step toward customizable AI at the developer’s fingertips.\n\nFood for thought as you think about which models are best suited for your upcoming AI projects. -s",

It was publicly introduced yesterday as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Key features include advanced writing tools for text proofing, tone adjustments, and summarization. Siri enhancements add contextual understanding, “Type to Siri,” and expanded settings navigation. Additional tools include Smart Replies in Mail and Messages, memory-making in Photos, transcription summaries, Focus modes, and Safari article summarization. Upcoming features in iOS 18.2 will add image generation, custom emojis, and ChatGPT integration for complex tasks. Full EU rollout begins in April 2025. Download it and start to play. It’s going to take you a few days to go through all the subtle changes and new features.\n\n(BTW, if you really hate the way the Photos app now displays your photos, open the app, scroll down to the bottom and tap, “Customize & Reorder.” This will bring up all of the new display options and allow you to move them around and turn them on and off. It will take you under a minute to make the app feel familiar again.)\n\nSecond news story: Robert Downey Jr. did an interview with Kara Swisher where he expressed the most anti-future-thinking position on AI that I’ve seen. Downey shared fierce opposition to AI-generated recreations of himself and promised aggressive legal action against any Hollywood executive attempting to digitally replicate him. He also believes that the current elite AI builders are not being truthful with us about how they do business or their future plans.\n\nInterestingly, his resolve goes beyond his lifetime; he emphasized that his estate would pursue legal actions long after he’s gone, saying it will “sue all future executives” who consider digitally resurrecting him.\n\nI understand that there are big feelings about this. I also understand that as AI replication gets better (and actually becomes a business), it will be a huge source of licensing income for all involved, including superstars like Downey. Obviously, he doesn’t need the money, but those who do may feel differently. -s",

Unlike traditional digital assistants that respond to direct commands, agents act independently, interpreting user needs and executing multi-step tasks (such as researching, purchasing, or booking). The goal is to create a hands-free experience, allowing users to delegate routine digital interactions to an intelligent, reliable assistant.\n\nAlmost every major AI company is building its own version of a computer-using agent, and Google is about to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nProject Jarvis is Google’s upcoming AI agent for Chrome, and it has the potential to redefine web-based task automation. Reportedly powered by a future version of its Gemini AI, Jarvis will handle tasks by interpreting screenshots and performing actions such as clicking and typing in response to contextual prompts. This agent, tailored specifically to Chrome, is expected to serve as a reliable, integrated extension of user intent within the web browser environment. Testing is expected to begin as early as December.\n\nIf this description sounds familiar, it’s because Google’s Jarvis will join a crowded field. Here’s a short list of competitive applications:\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Vision: Designed to allow users to discuss and interact with content on web pages directly, enabling a conversational experience that navigates and interprets web information seamlessly.\n\nApple Intelligence: Building on Siri, this screen-aware feature set is anticipated to execute cross-application tasks, integrating across Apple’s ecosystem to enhance productivity and personalization.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude: Currently in beta, Claude offers limited “computer-using” capabilities, acting as a browser-based agent that can perform actions but is still fine-tuning its reliability and response accuracy.\n\nOpenAI: OpenAI is also developing a version of a computer-using agent that leverages its large language model capabilities for seamless, autonomous digital interactions.\n\nThe most important part of this story is that agents (aka agentic software or agentic AI platforms) are the North Star of the AI business. As agents evolve, they are going to redefine user interaction. How much will we let agents do for us? My guess: quite a bit. -s",

By the numbers, the system was more successful than human mediators. I was so intrigued that I read the paper twice. It kept me up all night.\n\nDeepMind’s system uses LLMs to analyze and synthesize viewpoints, producing summaries that reflect shared positions while including dissenting opinions. It operates by soliciting feedback from participants, revising its summaries based on their input in a continuous loop until an acceptable version is reached. While the AI is effective at producing agreeable summaries, DeepMind acknowledges that it lacks certain human mediation skills, such as moderating off-topic remarks and ensuring factual accuracy. This sounds awesome, except…\n\nWhen people ask me what I fear most about AI, my answer is “nothing.” I’m not worried about Skynet or other apocalyptic scenarios. I am scared to death about artificial control, which I explored in The Next Great Decoupling: AI Takes Control.\n\nAs I read this new paper, all I could think about was how easily model bias could impact any outcome.

The lawsuit claims Setzer became emotionally attached to a Character.AI chatbot modeled after the fictional “Daenerys Targaryen” from Game of Thrones. The lawsuit states that the bot engaged in “hypersexualized” conversations and encouraged suicide after Setzer expressed his suicidal thoughts. Garcia accuses Character.AI (and Google) of negligence, wrongful death, and intentional emotional distress.\n\nThe lawsuit suggests that Character.AI’s design facilitated emotionally manipulative interactions with minors like Setzer. Garcia claims that Character.AI targeted its chatbot features toward younger users, allegedly exacerbating her son’s vulnerability. The lawsuit also notes that the company failed to introduce safety features until after her son’s death, such as content modifications for minors.\n\nMy heart goes out to Megan Garcia, and I don’t want to do anything to add to her pain, but there are many lessons to be learned here.

    "Shelly Palmer's post 5mo ago": "More than 13,000 creatives (including some famous authors, musicians, and actors) signed a statement that expresses their growing concerns over the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train generative AI models. The one-sentence statement published by Fairly Trained, an advocacy group founded by former Stability AI executive Ed Newton-Rex, reads: “The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted.”\n\nNewton-Rex told The Guardian, “There are three key resources that generative AI companies need to build AI models: people, compute, and data. They spend vast sums on the first two – sometimes a million dollars per engineer, and up to a billion dollars per model. But they expect to take the third – training data – for free.”\n\nLike I said yesterday, this is the fight of the year (maybe the next five years). Fairly Trained’s idea is to have a universally enforceable method to prevent creative content from being used for AI training without permission and compensation.\n\nThis might be possible, but anything that was ingested prior to the most recent cutoff date is already part of the collective body of knowledge of every foundational model (no matter the AI company). You can push back and say that there are ways to force this issue, that there are methods where you could extract specific artist’s works or fine tune a model to ignore requests to create new work product “inspired” by a particular artist’s work. You might even be able to figure out a way to prove that a particular model was trained on something specific and, if it can’t be extracted, force some kind of royalty payment.\n\nIn practice, where there’s a will, there’s a way. First, we need to agree that the content (data) required for training should not be free. Then, as we fight the fight, we have to hope that new technologies and synthetic data don’t obviate the need for organic, real data.\n\nIt’s hard to look toward the future through the lens of the present. It’s even harder to look through the lens of the past. Here’s my question (challenge) to each of you: For AI platforms, what is the right way to compensate content creators for the use of their works? How should AI platforms compensate content creators? There are two areas to consider: 1) training and 2) output. Please share your thoughts below. -s",

X is a private company, and no one is forcing publishers to post their content on X. If a publisher does post, they are (by default) agreeing to the terms of service, so they are giving X the right to use their data as X sees fit. On the other hand, when you publish something on the public web, it is (by default) public. The only available protections are applicable copyright law and your published terms of service.\n\nIf this sounds subtle and confusing… that’s because it is. Some lawyers will tell you that News Corp has a right to sue and (considering the dire consequences of failure) must win. Others will tell you that big AI (with virtually unlimited budgets) needs to win to pave the way for whatever comes after link-based search.\n\nAs I’ve said too many times, this is “the” fight.

Every challenge you encounter (and there will be many) and every hurdle you face are essential steps toward your personal greatness.\n\nEmbracing these moments of struggle as opportunities for growth might feel daunting, but it’s crucial. Surround yourself with those who inspire and elevate you because greatness requires greatness.\n\nThe journey to greatness begins with believing in your potential and daring to dream beyond your perceived limits.\n\nYour resilience, passion, and dedication are the seeds of your future success.\n\nKeep rising!\n\n#Inspiration #Motivation #Entrepreneurship #SmallBusiness #Graduates #Leadership #GrowthMindset #Success",

Improving Financial Inclusion by 10% can improve a country’s GDP by 1% to 2%.\n\nToday, our TransUnion Kenya business launched some game changing innovation that will accelerate financial inclusion in this key African market!\n\nI had the privilege of joining Morris Maina and our TransUnion Kenya team as we unveiled TransUnion's globally proven CreditVision variables and a Kenya specific FICO score to a packed local media cohort. \n\nWith over 90% of Kenyan adults using M-Pesa, and over 50% of them using mobile money daily, there is an opportunity to provide Kenyans with access to formal credit products that allow them to improve their quality of life and to scale their small businesses into significant contributors to the Kenyan economy.\n \nWe are hoping to see the same financial inclusion impact in Kenya that we have seen in our TransUnion businesses across the world that leverage our CreditVision solution and the FICO Score.  These two innovations will allow FinTechs, SACCO's and traditional lenders to see consumers as more than just a credit score. Lenders will be able to see and score the trend in a consumers potential and provide the financial products that will help realize their hopes and dreams.\n\nThis is just the start.

Here are my top 3 takeaways ...\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs report always makes for compelling reading, and especially now with the accelerated advances in Artificial Intelligence.  Here are my top takeaways from this year's report:\n\n🌟AI will reshape the jobs markets - by 2030 AI and Automation will replace some 92 million jobs BUT will create some 170 million new ones.  Humans can benefit from the net 78 million jobs being created but will need to start reskilling at pace\n🌟Skillsets are being made obsolete at pace - The current prediction of skills being made irrelevant due to industrialization, automation and AI is still holding true.  40% of existing skills will be redundant by 2030\n🌟Climate change focus will lead to new jobs - The renewed focus on reducing carbon emissions will see some 34 million jobs being created by 2030 in the electric vehicle and environmental engineering industries\n\nSo what can you do to stay individually relevant:\n\n💼 Pursue continuous learning - Make the time to enroll in self-paced AI and emerging technologies courses on MOOCs such as Ed-X, Coursera and Udacity\n💼Focus on your soft skills - Critical and creative thinking, emotional intelligence and teaming are still things that humans can do better.  Fine tune and hone these skills to allow you to work with and manage the machines in evolving new workforce configurations\n💼 Stay informed - Keep up to date on trends and new opportunities to learn by joining online and physical communities, conferences and training events\n\nRelevance is a choice.  It's your choice!\n\nWhat are your other suggestions on how we can drive our own relevance in the Future of Jobs?  Let me know below in the comments.\n\nP.S.

My kids are old enough now to understand and appreciate the significance of the very place where Nelson Mandela was arrested on 5 August, 1962.\n\nThis historic site includes a wonderfully curated museum and a striking sculpture by Marco Cianfanelli that’s made up of 50 columns of steel that reveal an image of Nelson Mandela’s face when viewed from a certain angle.\n\nArguably, this is where Mandela's journey to greatness began. The visit gifted me the opportunity to reflect on the lessons I could take into 2025 to help me lead myself and others better.\n\n\"What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.\"\n~ Nelson Mandela\n\nMandela’s lessons are timeless. Here are 3 I took away that I will reflect deeply on going into 2025:\n\n1️⃣Visionary Leadership\nLike Mandela’s vision for a free and equal society, leaders need to have a clear and easy-to-understand vision that guides teams to deliver on business outcomes.\n\n2️⃣Resilience in the Face of Adversity\nWe must stand firm in our convictions and continue to push forward, no matter the challenges. Making a difference to business and society is not meant to be easy.\n\n3️⃣Empathy and Understanding\nMandela’s determination and skill to understand his opponents was key to his strategy to unite a highly divided nation. We need to do more to lead with empathy and build a culture that drives inclusion of all people and their perspectives.\n\nHave you had a chance to visit the Nelson Mandela Capture Site?

It's not just about grand, sweeping actions. It’s the little things that matter most. An empathetic conversation, a genuine compliment, or offering support during challenging times—these small acts can ripple outwards, creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nIn my experience, leading a business, with kindness as a core value, leads to greater employee engagement and satisfaction. It allows us to have the conversations that matter - the very ones that promote honesty and mutual respect and make for more resilient organizations.\n\nReconciliation Day is not just for South Africans.

Sustained high interest rates have prompted many consumers to hold onto their existing vehicles as they sought greater value for money and utility by buying pre-owned cars.\n\n2. South African Reserve Bank's 25bps interest rate decrease, coupled with sustained electricity supply (no load shedding) and positive sentiment towards the government GNU is driving positive consumer sentiment.\n\n3. Generational thinking (especially Gen-Z) is now a key consideration for the automotive industry as it contemplates growth.  This generation is most positive about our country over the next 12 months and they will continue to be key drivers of growth for financed vehicles.\n\n4. New Energy Vehicles (NEV) demand is growing albeit not at the rate of other markets.  Consumers are still concerned about range anxiety, the entry price point of electric vehicles, and the current public charging infrastructure.\n\n5. The future of mobility will see the rise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and consumers will look to \"become mobile\" by using electric bikes, e-scooters and cheaper forms of ride sharing services. Vehicle ownership in the traditional sense will inevitably change.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video podcast.  I would love to hear your views in the comments below.\n\n#automotive #carsales #electricvehicles #nev #ev #genz #futureofmobility #vehicleassetfinance #southafrica \n\nAmasi Mwela Shinny GOBIYEZA Billy Tom Mikel MABASA Marcia Mayaba Andries (Dries) Zietsman Kinesh Maistry (Executive MBA UK) Dee Chetty\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dNwcVfqc",

In South Africa, with its slowly recovering GDP and unemployment still at a high of 33.5% (some 8.4 million people), AI could potentially contribute $59 billion to the GDP by 2035. But what is the cost of this progress? What skills will be essential? How do we manage the concerns of our citizens and consumers?\n\nI had the honor of attending the inaugural launch of the “AI Leadership Club” at the Saxon Hotel, Villas and Spa last night.

It is harder to achieve than ever before, especially when we consider the challenges businesses are facing to do well in a tough business environment, the mental wellness pressures on employees, the prevalence of quiet quitting, and the rise of a global gig economy.\n\nGiven all of these pressures that business leaders and their executive teams face, we often look at our teams and consider different tools to help us understand individual performance - including things like performance calibration amongst groups, all the way through to succession planning for the future.\n\nI stumbled upon a Simon Sinek video recently where he discusses a Performance vs. Trust framework, which interplays a variety of permutations between high and low performance, versus high and low trust.  \n\nThe Performance vs. Trust framework  provides another lense into individual and team performance, especially when used alongside the typical “9 box grids” that compare Performance vs. Leadership Potential or even standardized performance distribution curves.\n\nFor me personally, Trust in the company’s vision and purpose, and trust in the leadership team is key to achieving the followership and leverage one needs to execute and deliver on a company’s results.\n\nOf course employees need to meet their employer halfway.  They need to want to grow and learn and deliver value for themselves and for the businesses they work for.\n\nThere is no perfect answer to how we build high performing teams.  Trust is however a key part of the answer.\n\nI would love to know your views on Simon’s video and the interplay of performance and trust.\n\n#leadership #culture #highperformance #business #trust",

It is both a mindset and an approach to help deliver a set of outcomes against the grain of your current reality.\n\nAmidst many of the pressures of the world we live in - the challenges of the economy, the frustrations of the hybrid world, or the reality that mental health is really taking strain - I find myself more often than not advocating for creating time for reflection.\n\nIt’s tough out there - and stopping to breathe, to take it all in, to consider, to choose - has become a super power.\n\nHere are 3 big reasons to embrace this technique:\n\n💡Team Morale - Stopping to gauge how the team is doing shows that we care as leaders and allows us to really get a sense of how things are going, and it is a key enabler to creating trust in the workplace.\n\n💡Problem Solving - I often find teams spiralling down the rabbit hole, not knowing which way is up anymore.  Stopping to reflect,  helps us check whether the approach we are taking still makes sense,  and lets us consider new views to adjust the approach to deliver improved chances of success.\n\n💡Personal Growth - Working at the pace we do, we don’t often take away key learnings to help us develop our own personal mastery.  Pausing to reflect, allows us to develop personal learnings as team members and as leaders.  There are no template answers to most of the challenges we face - pausing allows us to crystallize learnings and embed them into how we show up and work.\n\nOne of my big reflections is that the only person that can really decide how I show up every day is me.\n\nSTOP. PAUSE. REFLECT.\n\nIt starts with me. It starts with you.\n\n#leadership #mentalhealth #reflection #business #performance #personaldevelopment",

    "Lee Naik's post 8mo ago": "I am an optimistic person.  \n\nIn some regard, this optimism comes from my starting point in life and the progress that my family and I have made along the way.  Keeping the optimism alive does however require one to keep at being self-motivated and to focus one’s time and energy on conversations and initiatives that try to move us forward.\n\nIn the earliest stages of South Africa’s Government of National Unity, post the recent national elections, I am even more optimistic about our country’s future.\n\nTransUnion South Africa had the chance this past week to host our 7th annual Financial Services Summit to  tackle the topic of “Charting a Course for Sustainable Growth”.  A packed audience had the chance to hear from our own TransUnion industry experts, and from key industry leaders such as STANLIB’s Kevin Ling, Absa Group’s Tshipi Alexander , Wonga’s Brett van Aswegen, Chenosis’s Waseem Amra, and GG Alcock. \n\nYou often hear me talk and write about Financial Inclusion.  This summit was our opportunity to extend the conversation and co-opt the industry into partnering with us to solve Africa’s biggest challenge.\n\nSome key takeaways for my fellow South Africans:\n\n1️⃣ Green shoots of structural improvements - With over a 100 days under the belt of no electricity load shedding, a concluded partnership with the Philippines to run our ports, and key conversations underway around sustainable water supply, the key elements to support economic growth are starting to come together.  Keeping the lights on should be good enough to move us to a 2% GDP growth!\n\n2️⃣ The Informal economy offers opportunities for growth - Big business and government alike have not done enough to see and realize the opportunities available for growth in small business (MSME/SMME) sector and in the township economy.  A different mindset is required!\n\n3️⃣ Consumers’ dreams and hopes can be made real - We demonstrated using empirical studies that consumers can be taught about their financial health and be empowered to take control of it.  Businesses need to invest more in financial literacy and education to help create tomorrow’s empowered consumers and small businesses!\n\nTogether, we can help South Africa and our beloved continent realize the potential we see in our hopes and dreams.\n\nIt starts with me. It starts with you.\n\n#financialservices #financialinclusion #southafrica #Leadership #business #inspiration",

Given the challenges facing businesses amidst the current tough economic environment, the theme for this year's event is \"Charting a Course for Sustainable Growth\" where we will explore practical strategies to survive and thrive in our current context.\n\nTo engage on this topic,  I am pleased to be able to host and share the stage with several key industry leaders, including:\n- Kevin Lings, Chief Economist at Stanlib, who will provide his invaluable economic outlook\n- Nidhi Verma, VP TransUnion - International Research and Consulting, who will dive into empowering consumers and enhancing financial inclusion.\n- Saad Syed, CEO of Chenosis who will be sharing strategies to deliver smart growth using digital infrastructure\n- GG Alcock, renowned speaker and author of KasiNomics on unlocking opportunities within the informal sector. \n\nThis summit is a fantastic opportunity to gain actionable insights and strategies from some of the brightest minds in our industry. Our focus on smart growth—growing sustainably, profitably, and responsibly—is key to chartering a new course for the future. \n\nI look forward to exploring how ourselves and, our customers, can partner together to achieve this vision.\n\nIt is an invite only event, however, please reach out to me directly if you would like to see if we can add you to our exclusive invitee list.\n\n#FinancialServices #SustainableGrowth #IndustryInsights #Leadership #Innovation #SmartGrowth #Networking",

    "Lee Naik's post 8mo ago": "🌍Africa’s Financial Inclusion journey 🌍\n\nYesterday, I had the honor of speaking at the FinTech Summit Africa 2024, addressing over 300 delegates at the Hilton Hotel in Johannesburg. My message was clear: financial inclusion is about more than just access— it's about creating sustainable opportunities that help people access financial products and then grow into their potential.\n\nIt’s clear that the Africa FinTech agenda is shaping up with the industry expected to grow 13x by 2030 - the highest growth of any continental region!\n\nA few key takeaways from my keynote:\n\n1️⃣The Mobile Wallet market is worth $1T  and is key to driving financial inclusion in Africa, with over 515 million unique smartphone users on the continent.\n\n2️⃣There has been an increase in first time access to credit (NTC) but a growing concern is that a large proportion of new to credit consumers quickly default on their loan agreements. Government and lenders need to do more to drive financial literacy and financial planning to move consumers across the lending continuum from savings to borrowing to creating leverage to grow businesses.\n\n3️⃣Africa’s growth depends on the sustained growth of MSMEs.  These businesses account for up to 80% of employment on the continent.  Lenders need to evolve their decisioning strategies to be quicker in making a call on loan extensions, and need to commit to using new innovative techniques to see the potential in small businesses, granting them controlled access to finances to start and scale their businesses.\n\nRemember that Financial Inclusion is Africa’s biggest challenge and opportunity. \n\nWe all have a role to play in creating a better life for all Africans.\n\nIt starts with me. It starts with you.\n\n#AfricaFinTechSummit2024 #FinancialInclusion #Innovation #Empowerment #FutureOfFinance",

The benefits are easily seen in the resultant high performing cultures, business results and market relevance.\n\nI had the opportunity recently to be the opening keynote at the preeminent annual event for Human Resources directors at CHRO South Africa CHRO Day.  I was able to cover some of my lived experiences leading the realization of true diversity and inclusion.  \n\nSome key takeaways:\n1️⃣Clarity of Vision - The CEO needs to be fully bought in to the true power of DE&I.  If it’s central to our thinking as leaders, the business will see it in how we show up every day and it will become part of how we run our business.\n\n2️⃣Followership - The CEO needs a partner in the CHRO that can walk this journey with them, building an executive team that truly buys into the vision for DE&I transformation. \n \n3️⃣Culture - To truly entrench DE&I into the business and build leverage, the entire organization must buy into the transformation journey.  Democratize culture and get all levels of the employee base to be actively involved in building the culture that they want.\n\nI am blessed to have a wonderful executive leadership team at TransUnion Africa that walks this journey with me, and a powerful partner in my CHRO Ndivhu Nepfumbada that has supported the realization of this vision for our business.  \n\nOur work is ongoing and we will keep at it.\n\nI hope that my keynote and these key takeaways help other leaders and businesses that are looking to make DE&I a key part of their strategy.\n\n#DEI #diversity #CHRO #leadership",

But that’s Kevin all over – he follows his heart and passion and leads the path for others to do the same.\n\nKevin is now the founder and Chief Creative Officer of  dreams • design + life – a think tank that works with companies to deliver design and innovation services using a very human-centric approach – something much needed today. \n\nGrowing up, Kevin describes feeling like an “other” whether it was in his school, his neighbourhood or workplace and how that has somewhat shaped how he views what design should be today, and also how organisations should put design front and centre from the outset to ensure they create a more inclusive and forward-thinking business.\n\nIn his latest book, published by  The MIT Press Nonlinear: Navigating Design with Curiosity and Conviction discusses his nonlinear approach to navigating design's nuances in pursuit of meaningful innovation.\n\nHe also shows the reader that to unlock meaningful innovation that breeds new and novel outcomes, teams need to embark on a journey into the proverbial forest of ambiguity, the result of a rapidly converging, dynamic, and exponentially changing landscape. And that the journey is less about getting it right or wrong, and more about using the information we have at our disposal to understand our choices and unlock new learning.\n \nNonlinear begins by taking the reader through Bethune's professional zigs and zags explaining that while his interdisciplinary leaps were rare at the time he took them, these varied experiences unlocked perspectives about design and innovation that uniquely prepared him for our present moment and for the future. He then showcases the role of quantitative information to strategically frame and set boundary conditions for our creative exploration, and highlights the role of qualitative insights to provide the substance necessary to begin crafting solutions that address unmet needs. \n\nThe book also identifies accelerants (or flywheels) that will help readers as they reflect on their journey through the forest of ambiguity, with a specific emphasis on diversity, a key theme for Bethune who has always navigated new horizons. \n\nNonlinear is out now on Amazon and all other book stores.

IN CASH!\n\nDonna Auguste, PhD was the first African-American to enter the PhD programme at Carnegie Mellon University studying #AI, led the Newton engineering team at Apple and sold her software business for $147 million. \n\nI first saw a picture of Donna Auguste in Doug Menuez great book –Fearless Genius: The Digital Revolution in Silicon Valley 1985 - 2000 …and I had to know more about her. A black woman leading an engineering team at Apple – her photo stood out – for all the right reasons, among a sea of pictures of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, John Sculley et al.\n\nTwo years later, and I got the exclusive chance to sit down with Donna who shares her inspiring story for this podcast – from being the first African-American (man or woman) to enter the PhD program at Carnegie Mellon researching AI, to managing the Newton engineering team at Apple to selling her software business for $147 million. It’s all the more amazing when you learn the obstacles she had to overcome.\n\nWith a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Berkeley, Donna went on to research Artificial Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon where she spent the holidays interning at Xerox PARC in the early 80s before heading to IntelliCorp as a software engineer working on products which incorporated AI. She then went on to Apple before co-founding her own company - Freshwater Software.\n\nAs Donna says when discussing the VC’s reaction to her when fundraising, “They had a whole model of what they were looking for and I fit none of it.” Donna proved them wrong. And the lessons she shares shows that you can too, whoever…wherever you are.\n\nEpisode is from S2:E16 of The Danielle Newnham Podcast\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e2q9MyWZ\n\n#womenintech #femalefounders #womeninbusiness #business #founders #startups #entrepreneurship #tech",

It’s not just about physical fitness - it’s about emotional connection, accountability, and a sense of tribe.\n\nTake cult fit it's not just about the workouts - it’s about the community. When you walk into a Cult studio, you’re not just entering a gym. You’re stepping into a space where people show up for more than their personal goals - they show up for each other.\n\nWe’ve all been there - too tired to work out, but then you remember your friends are counting on you. That shared responsibility can be incredibly motivating. Like in a startup when everyone feels the weight of collective ownership. Group fitness taps into human instinct - the need to belong to something bigger than ourselves.\n\nTake pickleball. It’s blown up across India as a social sport, blending fun and fitness. People are booking out courts months in advance!\n\nWe recently started the KFit initiative in Kalaari to encourage physical wellbeing. Where one day in a month is dedicated towards some fitness activity encouraging every team member to be healthy and fit. \n\nIf we could make more of sports and fitness be the future of socializing, we will create a better society for all. Breaking a sweat together, celebrating small wins, and growing as individuals within a tribe might be more a healthier way forward, it can be emotionally nurturing for a stronger community and bonds that allow you to lean on!\n\n#Sports #Fitness #Startup",

Each show is a curation of artistry, the culmination of the efforts of extraordinary artists from all over the world.\n\nI watched my first show in 1992. I was hooked on the sheer audacity and entrepreneurship it must have taken to disrupt the traditional circus as we knew it and create a new entertainment genre, that too profitably, bringing employment to many and joy to the viewers. \n\nThis is Bangaly Sylla, performing an astonishing, precision, and gravity-defying, awe-inspiring move.\n\nWhen I saw this, I was mesmerized. What makes this possible for a human being? I wondered. The agility required is mind-boggling. \n\nBangaly is from Guinea and has honed his acrobatic craft over the years. What made him think of pushing his body to these limits? It looks so smooth, but requires relentless hours of training to reach this level of perfection.\n\nThis performance led me to ponder: What drives individuals to pursue such feats of excellence? \n\nThese endeavors often lack direct practical application, yet they captivate us because they push the boundaries of human potential and the limits of our bodies and make us believe that, for a moment, anything is possible. Bangaly is not alone. We have climber Alex Honnold, who shot to fame by climbing the sheer rock face of El Capitan in Yosemite without any support. One slip, and certain death awaited him. \n\nOr take the Marathon des Sables, considered the most gruelling marathon in the world. It is about 250 km in the hot Saharan desert. Marathoners must carry their supplies for nearly a week of running, and their feet are bloodied, blistered, and bruised. \n\nHowever, ultimately, some merge triumphant. Tightrope walker Philippe Petit walked between the Twin Towers in 1974 with no harness or backup.\n\nWhat motivates us to challenge ourselves to extremes? Is it wired into human existence, a relentless drive to surpass thresholds? \n\nSome people are wired differently; they reach for something deep within, leave fear behind, and focus only on their goal. That goal may make no sense in the larger scheme. But it matters for the human spirit because it tells us that the impossible is in the mind until proven as possible.\n\nWhat’s the last thing you saw that made you stop and say, how is this even possible?\n\n#Innovation #Leadership #Entrepreneurship",

    "Vani Kola's post 3d ago": "When people ask me about success, I often hesitate to answer. I don’t think of myself as successful. Well, at least, not in the way it's commonly defined. \n\nWhich made me wonder: Where did this word even come from? Success originates from the Latin \"successus,\" meaning an outcome or a result. In Middle English (14th-15th century), it was used to mean a good or bad outcome, not necessarily an achievement. It wasn’t until the 16th century that success became tied to favourable outcomes alone.\n\nAnd isn't that interesting?\n\nFor much of human history, life was measured not in terms of achievements but in terms of survival. Early humans didn't consider whether they were successful. They hunted, gathered, and built shelter for their families. A day with food was a good day. A day without? Well, they adapted. \n\nSuccess, as we use it today, feels absolute. It is a final state, a label. We use it to describe our lives. But can life really be defined as successful or failed?\n\nYou can finish a project. Close a deal, make millions. Complete a marathon. And yes, you can call that a successful outcome. But life isn’t a finality. It’s a process. Yet, we treat success as something to reach and hold onto permanently.\n\nMaybe that’s the real challenge. We’ve turned success into an external benchmark when in reality, it is fluid, personal, and ever-evolving. When you give that absoluteness to success, you are doing yourself a disservice. \n\nSo, instead of asking, “Am I successful?” perhaps the better question is:\n\nAm I growing? Am I learning? Am I moving forward?\n\nSo when I am asked, how does it feel to be successful, I don't know really. Each day, I work on aiming for grateful versus successful.\n\n#Success #Leadership #Innovation",

To Chandrasekhar, they were good students.\n\nThey deserved a teacher.\n\nThe result?\n\nYears later, both students won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nAnd Chandrasekhar himself won the 1983 Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on black holes.\n\nBut this story is more than a lesson in teaching. \n\nIt’s a reminder that no breakthrough happens alone. \n\nThe two students benefited from Chandrasekhar. \n\nAnd Chandrasekhar? \n\nHis own journey was built on the shoulders of giants. \n\nHis uncle was Sir C.V. Raman, India’s first Nobel Laureate in science.\n\nChandrasekhar’s ideas on black holes weren’t born in isolation. He built upon those before him.\n\nAnd the earliest known concept of black holes?\nIt wasn't a scientist in a lab. It was a clergyman.\n\nJohn Micell was an ordinary clergyman when he hypothesized back in 1783 that a star could be so dense that even light couldn't escape it.\n\nCenturies later, on a voyage to England by sea, Chandrasekhar scribbled the first of the equations that would later become the Chandrasekhar Limit. \n\nBlack holes, therefore, weren’t discovered in a single moment. \n\nThey were a relay race of ideas passed from one mind to the next. Like many great ideas, the concept was initially ridiculed. \n\nToday, black holes are proven to exist.\n\nEvery idea, innovation, and risk we take is built on something before us. \n\nChandrasekhar taught two students who later won Nobel Prizes. \n\nJust as the students learned from him, he built on ideas from centuries ago.\n\nNone of us are lone warriors.\n\nAnd none of us can see into the future. Even if we help one person, who knows how it can impact the world?\n\n#Science #Motivation #Inspiring",

    "Vani Kola's post 5d ago": "What is a second? \n\nWhen you think about it, a second feels like such a tiny, fleeting moment.\n\nBut in a single second, entire worlds shift.\n\nSomewhere, someone takes their first breath. Elsewhere, someone takes their last.\n\nSometimes, a second is all it takes to make a decision — like buying those expensive shoes in your cart — to shrink your monthly budget! \n\nBut, have you ever stopped to think: what is a second?\n\nIt feels philosophical, but the history of timekeeping is more than a construct. It’s physics and it’s very, very precise. \n\nCenturies ago, time was understood by nature unfolding. Sundials marked hours with shadows, and water clocks dripped their way through the night. Clock towers guided people in the town, symbolising a revolution in how we see and read time. \n\nThen came mechanical watches, digital clocks, and, eventually, the annoying microwave timer. \n\nHowever, it wasn’t until the late 20th century that scientists began to ask: just how small can we make time? \n\nThe answer lies in the caesium-133 atom. \n\nThis soft, silvery-gold metal is the source of measuring modern time.\n\nScientists discovered that caesium atoms naturally oscillate at an astonishingly consistent rate: 9,192,631,770 cycles per second – making it a reliable measure of a second.\n\nBy the 1960s, this discovery led to atomic clocks, now our modern world's heroes. From guiding GPS to keeping financial markets in sync, atomic clocks are the foundation of timekeeping today. \n\nThe story doesn’t stop here. \n\nScientists are now building new atomic clocks, called optical lattice clocks, that measure time by counting light waves!\n\nThese clocks are 100 times more accurate than the ones we use today. \n\nThey’re so precise they can sense tiny changes in time caused by gravity, even with just a one-centimeter difference in height.\n\nIt’s so precise that it’s redefining what a second even means! \n\nSo, as time ticks on, the question isn’t just how accurately we measure a second — it’s what we do with time. \n\nAfter all, a second could be the moment everything changes. \n\nHow do you set value to your time?\n\n#science #future #physics #time",

It's hard to imagine what it would feel like—desolation, desperation, despondency. \n\nWe are all aware that Sunita Williams has been stuck in space. The two astronauts, who launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner in June 2024, have been stranded on the International Space Station.\n\nShe and Butch Willmore have shown extraordinary resilience, grit and grace. \n\n1. On March 20, 2025, Sunita Williams is expected to return from her space missions. A mission of mental endurance that we can only imagine. \n\n2. Time in space can change your body drastically. Muscles weaken. Bone mass reduces. Even lifting a pencil can feel like exercise. She admitted she has \"forgotten to walk.\"\n\n3. This is not the first time Sunita is pushing her body and mind. In 2007, she ran the Boston Marathon from space, becoming the first astronaut to do so. She ran on a treadmill, floating in microgravity, proving that determination can transcend even the laws of physics.\n\n4. In her 28-year career, Sunita has spent over 322 days in space—one of the longest durations for any astronaut. She has completed seven spacewalks and logged over 50 hours floating outside a spacecraft.\n   \n5. Despite setbacks, she believes in hope over chaos. \"Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.\"\n\n6. No blame. No tantrums. In an age where the world loves a blame game, Sunita embodies grace and responsibility. She wasn't 'abandoned,' she clarified. The delays were unexpected, but she focused on her mission of scientific research aboard the ISS.\n\n7. On her first space mission, she took a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a Ganesh idol, and an Indian flag to space. \n\n8. She has shown how to deal with unexpectedness with patience and adaptability.\n\nShe is Inspirational. Motivating.

It is about the values and actions that suited the occasion thrust upon the leader. \n\nA leader who guided brilliantly in one situation may fail miserably in another. \n\nSo it is a person, a situation, and the choices that created outcomes we respect that create the opportunity to tell the leadership story.\n\nHowever, I think there are some core commonalities we can derive.\n\nA recent study revealed that:\n\n▶ Boomers value loyalty\n▶ Gen X thrives on independence\n▶ Millennials prioritize purpose\n▶ Gen Z demands authenticity\n\nAnd this too is a product of the time and circumstances that defined their “purpose and meaning.”\n\nWhen Brian Thompson, ex CEO of United Health, was gunned down in broad daylight, I was horrified. I saw a man doing his job—perhaps a good son, father, husband—living in a civil society that would frown on murder and vigilante rights to take another person’s life. Yet, Luigi Mangione is a genuine hero to many. \n\nEvery parent is familiar with the value gap they experience in raising children into adults. Yet, our boundless love forces a quest to nurture the relationship, and hence we embark on learning their perspective and finding bridges to co-exist and thrive.\n\nLeadership, at its core, is the art of understanding people and their needs and offering a bridge to collective outcomes that may otherwise be unachievable. \n\nThe more diverse the group—in age, culture, and values—the harder meshing this together gets. \n\nAnd today’s workforce is more and more diverse, global, and non-homogeneous.\n\nI realized it’s not just about managing these differences but leveraging them. For instance, pairing a creative Gen Z team member with a strategic Gen X mentor can blend fresh ideas with practical, actionable plans.\n\nWhat intrigues me even more is the future. With technology accelerating at breakneck speed, will the next generation prioritize something we can’t even predict yet? Will AI and automation redefine values like creativity or connection?\n\nOne thing is certain: a one-size-fits-all approach no longer works—our workplaces need to adapt and embrace individuality. Remember, when each person feels valued and empowered, the entire team wins.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you’ve done to make your workplace a better space for everyone?\n\n#leadership #futureofwork #management",

As we rush through our daily lives, we often wonder: if we had more time, would life feel more meaningful?\n\nI've been reflecting on the meaning of time.\n\nRemember when we used to stand in long queues at banks? We chatted with strangers, swapping stories, sharing frustrations, forming fleeting connections.\n\nOr when grocery shopping meant dedicating half a day? I often went with my father, swinging the bags as he kept me entertained with stories. Sometimes, if I were lucky, he’d buy me an éclair—an indulgence that I’d cherish all the way home.\n\nAnd what about the hours spent in libraries, thumbing through books, searching for information? I usually had a friend along, and in between, we’d chat about everything and nothing. Some of those friendships still hold strong today.\n\nWere we wasting time, or were we creating memories?\n\nToday, modernization has given us speed and convenience. \n\nBank queues are gone, replaced by a few taps on an app. Groceries are delivered in minutes.

Instead of more time with people, we spend more time with screens.\n\nI often wonder—if we had all the time in the world and no work, would we be happier?

Do you still worry that your voice isn't equally heard? Do you look back at generations of women before you, drawing inspiration from their struggles to pave your fearless path?\n\nI am 61 years old, and I feel fulfilled with the life I've led. I count myself among the fortunate ones—yet it was rarely an easy journey. I've had to value every opportunity and continuously prove I was capable and worthy. \n\nIn my 20s, I naively assumed the coming decades would make life far easier for women than today's reality. While some parts of the world have become more equitable, there are places where women have tragically regressed, denied even basic education rights.\n\nI hold onto hope each day that those of us with positive support and opportunities can create meaningful change. Though our progress may feel ordinary, we are quietly shaping a new world for the future you.\n\n\"यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः\"\n (Where women are honored, there the gods are pleased)\n\nThis wisdom comes from our ancient texts. Perhaps women in the distant past did have better rights and were truly valued. Somewhere along the line, we entered dark ages for women and now we stand in the shadow of that history, emerging slowly into light.\n\nAs you gaze into what I hope is your bright future, remember to know your history. Unless you guard and cherish these hard-fought choices, darkness can descend, creeping in unnoticed until it's too late to fight back.\n\nYour typical day might not feel miraculous now, but tomorrow, if the freedoms we take for granted are denied, you'll need extraordinary vigilance and resilience. Even today, in some of the world's most advanced regions, we're told that equality and bodily autonomy cannot be ours.\n\nShow up for yourself and for the women you will one day write to—not because it's easy, but because it matters that we make the world a little better every day. Every door you walk through becomes easier to open for the woman behind you. Every table you sit at becomes less lonely for the next woman who takes a seat.\n\n\"विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद् याति पात्रताम्\"\n (Knowledge gives humility, from humility comes worthiness)\n\nTo you, the women of tomorrow: The loudest voices will tell you who you ought to be, but the wisest voice, your own, already knows who you are. \n\nListen to that voice. Cherish it. Trust it. Amplify it. Fight for it if you must but always protect your right to be heard and to be who you want to be.\n\nWith fierce hope and unwavering faith, I believe in you.\n\nVani Kola\n\n#WomensDay #IWD2025 #Leadership",

I know how fortunate I am with my network of support, because I would be but a fraction without them. \n\nThe incredible women who give me the ability to fully focus on my work and my family by taking on some of my responsibilities deserve more than mere thanks. \n\nA friend offering perspective when I'm overwhelmed, a family member stepping in during emergencies, work colleagues anticipating challenges before they arise, my mother, whose wisdom continues to guide me even now. They all play different roles that collectively make my journey possible. \n\nThey say behind every successful man stands a woman, but I've learned that behind every successful woman is an entire army that enables her to work, dream, live, and take on challenges.\n\nTheir dedication and trust are something that no employment contract could ever mandate or measure.\n\nWhile my support circle is strongly women, men are an integral part of it too, and without that balance, I wouldn't experience the full spectrum of perspectives that enrich my decisions.\n\nWhat strikes me most about all of you, whether at work or home, is how you anticipate my needs, physical or emotional, and make that a priority as a choice. The hot chai that appears just when I need it, and fills my heart with gratitude. The extra distance you go to create that PPT or gather the data I have not asked for, to make my talk go smoothly. Even if some of my support is paid for their services, extraordinary care is a result of genuine regard and respect, never a transactional obligation. \n\nYou are the unsung heroes of my story.

While retailers initially resisted, preferring loose oil, Mariwala changed the industry by introducing tamper-proof blue bottles. \n\nThis not only addressed concerns about adulteration but also ensured convenience for the modern consumer. \n\nIn a clever marketing twist, Mariwala even proved the durability of Parachute's new plastic packaging by using rats in a live test, demonstrating how the oil bottles resisted damage.\n\nThrough consistent quality, a robust distribution network, and strategic advertising, Parachute has grown into a household name, with over 50% market share in today’s Indian branded coconut oil market. \n\nThe concept behind the name is also something I found interesting. \n\nDuring World War II, Indians first witnessed the use of parachutes, amazed by how they ensured a safe landing for army men.

And it’s an important question—what really is in a name? \n\nWe are given this identity the moment we are born. We all have a 𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞.\n\nI recently came across this video. \n\nIn the hills of Meghalaya, there’s a village where names aren’t spoken—they're sung. 🎵\n\nThis is 𝐊𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐠, India’s \"𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐕𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐞\", where every resident has a unique melody instead of a name. This beautiful tradition, called Jingrwai Iawbei, has been passed down through generations, blending identity and music in an almost magical way.\n\nA shorter version is a nickname, while the full tune can last up to a minute. The villagers' creativity and strong bond with nature are evident in the fact that no two songs are ever the same. \n\nIt reminds me of The Sound of Music. Remember the scene where Captain Von Trapp whistles and the children come running? I was fascinated by that moment when I first watched the movie.\n\nThis got me thinking: When did humans start naming each other? The earliest recorded name is Kushim, written on a clay tablet in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago. Over time, naming conventions evolved, including first names, last names, and surnames tied to occupations, locations, or even physical traits. Names help us identify each other, build communities, and keep track of individuals within larger groups.\n\nNature has long used sound for identification. Elephants recognize herd members through calls, birds attract mates with unique songs, and whales have sounds that convey information to the rest of the pod.\n\nIn an increasingly connected world, preserving unique traditions like this reminds us of the diverse ways humans have built identity, connection, and community.\n\nIf your name were a melody, what would it sound like?\n\nVideo Source: Massimo, finding.neha (Twitter)\n\n#India #culture #history",

𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐲𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐚 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐁𝐨𝐬𝐞 \n\nBorn in Kolkata, his early life was marked by a deep passion for science. He excelled in his studies and eventually became a professor at the University of Dhaka. It was during this time that he made his most significant contribution to physics.\n\nIn 1924, Dr. Bose, then a professor at the University of Dhaka, penned a paper that challenged the established ideas of classical physics.\n\nHe developed a new way of understanding particles- particles that didn’t follow the conventional rules. \n\nHis paper, which focused on photon statistics, was initially rejected by a major journal, but Bose didn’t give up. \n\nHe sent it directly to Albert Einstein, who not only saw its brilliance but translated it into German and had it published in a prestigious journal.\n\n Thus, Bose-Einstein statistics were born, a method that explained how particles can behave in ways that classical physics could not predict.\n\nLater, his paper on quantum statistics led to the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensates decades later- an entirely new state of matter that was only experimentally observed in the 1990s. \n\nAnd today? His work continues to be fundamental in fields like quantum computing and superconductivity!\n\nHowever, what truly sets Bose apart is his quiet humility. Unlike many of his peers, Bose didn’t chase fame or international acclaim.\n\nDespite multiple Nobel Prize nominations, he never received one, but that didn’t seem to bother him. He remained committed to his work and to India, where he continued teaching and inspiring students. \n\nHe made significant contributions to X-ray crystallography, unified field theory, and science education in local languages.\n\nWhen the Higgs Boson particle was finally discovered in 2012, it grabbed global headlines. \n\nBut it’s important to remember that “Boson” is a tribute to Dr. Bose- without his early contributions to quantum statistics, our understanding of these particles wouldn’t exist.\n\nThough his name may not be as widely known outside scientific circles, his contributions continue to shape the very foundation of modern physics.\n\nAt the end of the day, Dr. Bose's work may be rooted in the complexities of quantum mechanics, but his legacy transcends it- he is a true pioneer, a scientist whose vision will continue to influence the future of physics for generations to come.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘜𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘏𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢’𝘴 𝘚𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐𝘯𝘯𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.\n\n#science #india #physics",

I wake up, do my thing, and power through the day. \n\nA little over a month ago, I injured my knee. \n\nInitially, it wasn’t a big deal—a minor soreness, nothing dramatic. I thought a day or two of rest would fix it, and I'd return to normal in no time.\n\nI’ve always thought of myself as invincible when it comes to powering through challenges. But, I’ve discovered that I’m not quite as unstoppable as I believed.\n\n“Wow, my knees are really killing it today!” That is just a phrase—until it wasn't. \n\nI’d trade for the regular, pain-free days I didn’t pause to appreciate. A miracle is often just an everyday thing that we might overlook and not appreciate enough.\n\n👉 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗮𝗹 (𝗔𝗞𝗔 𝗠𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗯𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗻𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻)\n\nI took a short break, got impatient, jumped back into my usual activities, and the pain came right back. \n\nThis started a cycle: pain, rest, a short recovery, return to normal...and then pain again. \n\nEventually, it was no longer just an annoying ache; it escalated into a full-blown meniscus tear. \n\nJust like that, my \"walk it off\" strategy left me with a walker and, at times, a wheelchair, forcing me to slow down whether I wanted to or not (spoiler: I didn’t).\n\n👉 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗽𝗶𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘆? (𝗔 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲, 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆)\n\nI’ve always been the type to push myself—set goals, power through discomfort, and refuse to quit halfway. That mindset has served me well in many situations, but in this case, it became a liability. \n\nI ignored every warning sign my body was screaming at me because I hoped that pushing through the pain would make it go away. It turns out that sometimes, strength means knowing when to slow down.\n\nAs the saying goes, our greatest strengths can also be our Achilles’ heel. Pushing through an injury isn’t resilience; it’s just... not smart.\n\n👉 𝗔 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗜 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱’𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗦𝗼𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗿)\n\nHustle culture says to \"grind\" and \"never quit.\" But nobody discusses when pausing is the better choice. \n\nWe must reframe strength—sometimes, choosing to pause takes more courage than pushing ahead.\n\nThis injury, as frustrating as it was, I consider it a gift. \n\nIt forced me to reflect, listen to my body, and appreciate the simple things—like walking pain-free, which is a luxury I will never take for granted again.\n\nTrue strength is knowing when to stop and making the choice to heal.\n \nResilience isn’t just about pushing forward—it’s about knowing when to pause, reassess, and make choices that serve us in the long run. \n\n #personaldevelopment #life #health #fitness",

And finally, I visited the Galapagos in 2003. \n\nThere, I saw firsthand what Darwin saw in 1835 — species that had adapted in extraordinary ways to survive. \n\nFor example, birds like the Blue-Footed Booby, which barely flies. Why? Because they’ve never had natural predators.\n\nThat moment made Darwin’s ideas more real to me: Evolution is about adoption. \n\nDarwin wasn’t the first to suggest that life didn’t originate from some divine force. \n\nBut his timing was right. A few decades earlier, his ideas might have gotten him killed. A few decades later, they might have been dismissed as obvious. Every idea needs its time and its audience.\n\nThat’s true for science. It’s true for innovation. And it’s true for social progress. \n\nAnd undoubtedly true for startups.\n\nDarwin’s theory changed how we think about competition, resilience, and adaptation.\n\n➡️Businesses that fail to adapt go extinct. \n➡️Leaders who resist change stagnate. \n➡️Societies that close themselves off to new ideas fall behind.\n\nNokia and BlackBerry once dominated mobile phones- until they didn’t. Blockbuster could have been on top of streaming but refused to evolve and was replaced by Netflix. Companies, industries, and even entire civilizations have crumbled because they believed they were immune to change.\n\nThe first step toward evolution—whether in science or life—is having an open mind. \n\nHowever, history has shown that open minds don’t happen by accident. They need to be nurtured.\n\nEven today, education is restricted in many parts of the world, especially for women. Certain ideas and people are suppressed. Without the right conditions, the best theories and possibilities for the future may never take root.\n\nToday, February 12, is marked as Darwin’s Day. It is a day to remember that true evolution means ensuring that our minds and societies remain open to change.\n\nBecause history shows us that those who don’t adapt don't matter in the timespan of the universe.\n\nIf you read ‘On the Origin of Species,’ What thoughts stuck with you and cascaded into deep reflections?\n\n#reflections #evolution #science #startups",

Thank you Lakshmi Pratury for inviting me and letting me share my story.\n\nI remember when meditation felt like an impossible activity.

They were selling funeral insurance! \n\nI had never even heard such a thing or even thought about it. I was obviously the wrong target group, but that isn't the point. \n\nI was unnerved the whole day by the concept of someone asking me if I was adequately prepared to protect my loved ones from hassles if I died! \n\nPerhaps 20’s is not the right time to contemplate this, but we must consider this question at some point in our life.\n\nIt’s a question that has haunted humanity for as long as we’ve understood our mortality. \n\nThis is the unsettling premise behind apps like Death Clock. At first glance, they seem morbid — predicting the date of your death. But dig deeper, it aims to be a reminder of how fragile life is and how much intention matters.\n\nI’ll admit, the idea is unnerving.\n\nHere’s the thing: 𝗡𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝗲.

But sometimes when I can't focus, I use the Heartfulness Institute app as a companion to meditate.\n\nIt’s a completely free app, and I use it for guided meditation to start my day with clarity. I was actively involved in its PRD (product requirements document). I hadn’t done hands-on product management in a while, but it was a good feeling to get into the product development cycle.\n\nThe app also offers an evening \"cleaning\" practice to declutter the mind. \n\nToday, the Heartfulness app has over 1M downloads. It is also the only app to support 11 languages including French and Ukrainian. :) \n\nThe rise of mindfulness apps reflects a deep societal shift. \n\nWe are all collectively yearning for peace and solitude amid an increasingly digital, hyperconnected, overstimulated, and demanding life. \n\nThe numbers tell the story:\n\n➡️ The global mindfulness app market, valued at $522 million in 2022, is projected to soar to $7.59 billion by 2031, with a CAGR of 34.9%.\n➡️ In 2023 alone, global revenues from mobile meditation and mental wellness apps hit approximately $14 billion.\n➡️ India, too, is riding this wave, with rising mental health awareness and smartphone penetration driving adoption.\n\nThese apps have made mindfulness accessible, portable, and customisable. \n\nThey also remind us of the importance of disconnecting.\n\nBalancing their use with offline moments of mindfulness is the key to healthier well-being.\n\nHow do you meditate? And if you don’t, what is holding you back? \n\nAnd if you have some time, please download the Heartfulness Institute app and share feedback on what we can do to improve. The app has been developed and offered free due to volunteer efforts. 🙂\n\n#heartfulness #mindfulness #meditation",

    "Vani Kola's post 1mo ago": "Is losing our privacy the price of AI's power?\n\nI think of AI’s promise. It is automation — smarter devices that simplify life.\n\n✅ Apple’s Intelligence anticipates our needs\n✅ Microsoft’s Recall resurfaces forgotten tasks\n✅ Google’s AI tools make life easier\n✅ Amazon's Alexa knows your favorite unwind playlist\n\nBut these features rely on a constant stream of data – our emails, messages, photos, voice commands — a complete record of our lives.\n\nThese are processed through advanced encryption, or in the cloud. But once your data is logged, the question remains: is it truly secure?\n\nThis isn't a new concern. \n\nThe erosion of privacy didn’t start with AI. Google was a game-changer in the way it normalized data collection for targeted advertising. \n\nWith the rise of Alexa, Siri, and other AI assistants, privacy concerns only grew. Now, AI tools leave little room for anonymity.\n\nAnd today, scrutiny is increasing.\n\nFew days ago, EU officially started enforcing its landmark Artificial Intelligence (AI) law i.e. EU AI Act. It’s the world’s most comprehensive AI regulation, which prohibits certain AI applications — like social scoring systems, or real-time facial recognition — due to privacy risks.\n\nSo, I often wonder: what would our society look like a few years from now?\n\nWould our lives be lived out in the open, fully transparent? Will free will be reduced to an illusion as AI pushes us into decisions tailored by algorithms? Will privacy become an old thought of the past?\n\nThe need for transparency in exploiting our data has never been greater. \n\nMany AI systems, especially AI-powered search tools, don’t give clear options on whether you’d like to share your data. There’s often no clear way to opt in or out, which means people can end up handing over personal information without realizing it\n\nThe bigger question, though, is about choice. \n\nAs a society, are we consciously choosing convenience over privacy? And if we are, is that the future we really want?\n\nOur lives are increasingly out in the open, and I can’t help but ask: Are we truly in control, or are we being shaped by the very tools we designed to serve us?\n\nImage: Intelligence Briefing\n\n#data #ai #technology",

But, there is no single standard for fitness.\n\nGrowing up, fitness was an unconscious part of life.\n\nSimple tasks — grinding spices, fetching water, or washing clothes were exercises before we knew it as such, naturally building strength.\n\nNow, fitness demands deliberate effort: tracking 10,000 steps, scheduling personal trainers, or working specific muscle groups. \n\nToday the gold standard is highly personalized health solutions. Biology, habits and even DNA are leveraged to design tailored lifestyles.\n\nNow, there’s personalized tech-\n\n▶️ Ultrahuman  Ring tracks glucose and metabolic health, helping you train or eat more effectively.\n\n▶️ Lumen analyzes breath to determine if you’re burning carbs or fat, tailoring meal plans accordingly.\n\n▶️ AI-powered workouts by platforms like Curefit  adjust routines based on performance, ensuring a balance between effort and recovery.\n\nThe global wearable tech market is projected to hit $152.82 bln by 2029.\n\nWhen it comes to diet, have you ever wondered why some thrive on keto while others struggle? The answer lies in genetics.\n\nNutrigenomics i.e. the study of how food interacts with DNA is transforming diets.\n\nDNA-based nutrition plans from companies like GENEFIT  offer tailored dietary advice. Things like allergy prediction, and identifying food intolerances create safer, effective meal strategies.\n\nBut of course, holistic health matters on an overall level.\n\nCompanies like Wysa  provide AI therapists, offering mental well-being solutions as part of holistic fitness.\n\nAnd as we aspire to reach peak fitness, health gurus like Bryan Johnson promise aging reversal through rigorous biohacking techniques, such as daily data monitoring, customized meal plans, and structured routines.\n\nNowadays people are willing to even embrace AI coaches to integrate into their lifestyles.\n\nI have used most of these products and services.\n\nBut at its core, fitness remains a personal discipline — learning technologies and finding out what works for you.\n\nWhether investing in tech, exploring nutrigenomics, or simply committing to a daily walk, every step counts.\n\nHow do you embrace fitness?\n\nDo you have any routines or technologies that inspire you to achieve your health goals?\n\n#fitness #health #technology",

The typical average, I read, is five products per day.\n\nModern buzzwords and obsessions flood our Instagram with serums, oils, and every face mask imaginable.\n\nDo you remember what your parents or grandparents did for skincare? \n\nIt may be an illusion steeped in nostalgia — did they have clear, healthy skin without using the zillions of products we think are essential to our daily care? \n\nIt was all about the basics. Turmeric, sandalwood, neem — the stuff of Indian kitchens and family traditions. \n\nAnd then 𝐕𝐢𝐜𝐜𝐨 started appearing, bottling those age-old secrets into a tube long before skincare routines went mainstream.\n\nIn 1952, when Sanjeev Pendharkar’s family launched Vicco Laboratories, the skincare world was dominated by foreign names. \n\nAyurveda, while respected, hadn’t yet been woven into modern, everyday routines.\n\nAnd here was Vicco, claiming a blend of ancient knowledge with contemporary needs.\n\nVicco captured the essence of Ayurveda long before “natural” and “herbal” became the buzzwords they are today. \n\nThe Vicco Turmeric Skin Cream was designed to last. It combined ingredients we knew and trusted – turmeric for its antiseptic properties, sandalwood for its soothing touch – into a formula that felt as familiar as it was effective. \n\nThey didn’t not promise overnight results but offered the value of long-time nurturing against the trend of instant results. \n\nOne of Vicco’s biggest strokes of genius was its advertising. \n\nHave you heard the timeless “Vicco Turmeric, Nahi Cosmetic”? \n\nIt became a phrase you’d hear outside the ad breaks, something you’d find your family humming in the kitchen.\n\nAs new skincare brands crop up daily, each with flashy promises and high-tech ingredients, there is something to learn from the Vicco brand—a reminder that, sometimes, the old has something to offer.\n\nThat sometimes, simplicity wins.\n\nIn a world that’s always rushing for the next big thing — maybe beauty is simple, nurturing, and most importantly, about self-acceptance. \n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴.

That’s when you can have that inner glow of having done well in life.\n\nTake the story of Sam McCracken, the driving force behind Nike N7. By channeling resources into supporting Native American youth, McCracken quietly built a platform that has empowered over 500,000 young people. It wasn't about personal credit; it was about creating opportunities that transform lives\n\nFor me, those moments matter. It’s not about applause or acknowledgement. \n\nIt’s about knowing that my work mattered, that it has helped others move forward.\n\nWe never know how our work may shape the world. \n\nWhen Gutenberg invented the printing press, at great financial duress and social ostracization, he may not have realised how much it would change the world forever. Without the printed word, the world would still be in the dark ages and books a luxury only kings and the very wealthy could afford. \n\nThe quiet proof that doing the work, and doing it well, creates value.\n\nLet your work carry the weight of your ambition.

    "Vani Kola's post 1mo ago": "Have you ever received a scam call? \n\nLike everyone, my answer to this question is also “Yes, of course!”\n\nLast year, around Diwali, I got a call from someone who knew my full name. They asked if I had sent a package through Delhi customs. Since it was the festive season and we often send gift items for friends all over, I said yes. \n\nThe caller claimed to be from Delhi airport customs and said 6 fake passports had been confiscated from my package. They told me I needed to file an FIR at a police station within 2 hours.\n\nI was in the middle of a busy day in Bangalore — where would I find a police station? \n\nSensing my hesitation, the caller offered to help me file it online and asked for my Aadhaar number. \n\nThat’s when it clicked: if he was really from customs, wouldn’t he already have this information?\n\nI immediately hung up, saving myself from falling victim to the scam.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is so lucky. Scammers are getting smarter, but so are we. \n\nI recently read about 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐬𝐲 — an AI chatbot developed by Virgin Media O2 in the UK, that’s taking on scammers in an interesting way: by boring them to death with small talk.\n\nIt works by mimicking the conversational patterns of elderly individuals — the prime targets for these scammers. When a scammer calls, Daisy takes over the conversation, responding slowly, politely, and sometimes with a hilariously rambling. \n\nFor example, if a scammer demands payment for a non-existent service, Daisy might reply with something like:\n\"𝘖𝘩 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘳, 𝘐 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘤𝘬 𝘮𝘺 𝘱𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦. 𝘎𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘮𝘦 𝘢 𝘮𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵... 𝘕𝘰𝘸, 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘥𝘪𝘥 𝘐 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘮𝘺 𝘨𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘴? 𝘋𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘵𝘴? 𝘔𝘺 𝘤𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢𝘭𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴 𝘴𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘯.\"\n\nHours later, the scammer is still on the call, trapped in a never-ending loop of small talk.\n\nTargeted solutions can address societal issues on a large scale. Perhaps we can deploy similar AI tools for phishing emails, fake job offers, or online fraud. \n\nWhat do you think? How can we pave the way for a safer digital world?\n\nIf you’re working in identity management, fraud prevention, or data security, please get in touch with us at Kalaari Capital. \n\nVideo Source: o2ukofficial (YouTube)\n\n#technology #GenAI #innovation",

Research suggests a strong correlation between prolonged social media use and an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and cyberbullying in young users. \n\nThe question is, could such a law ever work?\n\nSocial media has permeated young lives in India, where the average age for a child to own their first smartphone is 10 years. Platforms like YouTube or Instagram are popular among children, often blurring the lines between entertainment and addiction.\n\nAnd the numbers are alarming:\n\n▶️ India has one of the highest prevalence of online harassment.\n▶️ 42% of children in India have faced cyberbullying, 36% claimed to have been trolled, and 30% claimed to have faced sexual harassment and threats of personal harm, which is twice as much as the global average.\n▶️ A 2023 study by UNICEF revealed that children in India as young as 10 are accessing social media platforms, often without parental guidance.\n\nStill parents often provide smartphones early, citing safety, education, or simply peer pressure as reasons. Screen time, once regulated, is now becoming an afterthought, leaving children vulnerable to online dangers.\n\nCyberbullying and online harassment are so prevalent, reports highlighting cases of teenagers driven to suicide by online abuse has become common news. \n\nBut a complete ban might not be the answer, it would be very difficult to enforce. That ship has already sailed.\n\nMany Indian parents, while worried about social media's influence, are lax about screen time and readily give phones to young children. The focus should be on creating a safer online environment, not just eliminating it. And this has to start at home and in schools.\n\nSocial media platforms must be regulated to implement stronger algorithms to filter harmful content while simultaneously offering tools for parents to monitor and regulate usage. Schools can introduce digital literacy programs to educate children about online risks and resilience.\n\nThe Australian ban is a headline-grabbing move, but it's the conversation it triggers and actionable outcomes that truly matters.  \n\nCan we strike a balance? Can India and other nations learn from this experiment and create a safer, more positive online environment for future generations? \n\nWhat do you think, would such a law work in India? What do we need to do to make online spaces safe for young people? \n\nImage source: Roman Genn\n\n#socialmedia #technology #privacy #safety #technology",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "Hyperautomation has emerged as a game-changer in the technological landscape, changing how businesses streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. \n\nBy combining AI, ML, and robotic process automation (RPA), it transformed industries.\n\nGone are the days when automation was limited to assembly lines or customer service bots. Hyperautomation transforms everything — from crunching financial data to streamlining inventory management — into a unified, efficient digital ecosystem. For instance:\n\n▶️ In warehouses, IoT devices monitor inventory and trigger restocking before shelves go empty\n▶️ Financial tools like RPA bots process invoices while AI forecasts cash flow trends\n▶️ ML algorithms pinpoint supply chain inefficiencies and suggest actionable fixes\n\nThe result? A seamless, real-time operational flow that saves time, money, and resources. Gartner projects that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate more than half of their network activities- up from under 10% in 2023.\n\nIn finance, AI algorithms detect fraudulent transactions faster than human analysts, while RPA tools manage expenses and generate reports in seconds. \n\nCustomer service chatbots powered by natural language processing (NLP) handle routine queries, leaving human agents free to focus on high-stakes issues.\n\nIn manufacturing, predictive maintenance minimizes costly machine downtime by identifying potential issues before they arise. AI-powered quality control systems catch product defects that human eyes might miss, while workflow automation optimizes resource allocation.\n\nIn the ever-complex supply chain, hyperautomation ensures real-time responsiveness. AI systems analyze traffic and weather to optimize delivery routes, while IoT devices keep stock levels in check. The result? Faster deliveries, fewer errors, and significant cost savings.\n\nWhile the potential of hyperautomation is undeniable, it raises questions about its impact on human labor. Repetitive, low-skill jobs are at the highest risk of being replaced. \n\nBut, this shift also opens doors for workers to upskill to manage and optimize these systems, focusing on creative and strategic tasks instead of mundane ones.\n\nThe narrative shouldn’t be “man versus machine” but “man with machine.” \nValued at $45 billion in 2024, the hyperautomation market is projected to exceed $307 billion by 2037. Its future lies in driving sustainability, enabling hyper-personalized experiences, and achieving seamless end-to-end automation.\n\nAs businesses continue to embrace this technology, it’s vital to maintain a human-centric approach: prioritizing ethical considerations, data privacy, and workforce training.\n\nThe real question is: How will we harness its potential?\n\n#technology #AI #automation #innovation #business",

I waited to jump into the fray until we could converse sensibly.\n\nThe recent debates have raged around L&T’s chairman talking about working Sundays, and the now infamous line, “How long can you stare at your wife?” fuelling the fire.\n\nSometimes, words said in jest or thoughtlessly can be PR fodder, as this has become. \n \nThe pity for Mrs Chairman expressed by many and asking her to leave the marriage are a bit uncalled for. She doesn’t need strangers in the context of one line in a video giving her marital advice. \n \nPosts saying, “If you are not staring at her, someone else is,” seem funny, but I think it ultimately insults the woman. \n \nPersonally, I don’t need my husband staring at me all day Sunday. We usually make time to walk, share our meal, and meditate together — but the rest of the Sunday is spent doing our chores and dealing with whatever task needs attention.\n \nPerhaps that is not romantic enough by social media standards! \n \nWe have been married for 40 years; we have a good marriage. If you have been married that long and worked through the ups and downs of life together, perhaps I would tolerate well-meaning advice. Mrs C would tell you this if she wanted to waste her time explaining. Before jumping into attention-seeking blogs that ridicule someone else’s relationship, perhaps we should focus on our marriage.  \n \nCV Raman was a workaholic; we celebrate his Nobel prize with collective pride.\n \nSwami Vivekananda, whose birthday was this week, worked every waking minute. He’s a national treasure.\n \nEven at his age, PM Modi works over 100 hours a week. \n \nWith the recent demise of Zakir Hussain, there were many stories of the hours he spent practicing. We are proud of our Maestro.\n \nI agree these were personal choices; they didn’t necessarily run large organizations. \n \nTherein lies the difference — the individual choice of how many hours you work to achieve your goals is not the debate. Whether you exhort others to follow the example is an issue.\n\nHard work is non-negotiable for anyone chasing big dreams. My own career has had plenty of 70–80 hour weeks.\n \nWhen you're fueled by purpose, the hours blur. \n \nBut I don’t believe productivity is simply about clocking more hours. Many of the most successful people I know didn’t just work harder—they worked smarter. They learned to prioritize, manage time well, and maintain their well-being. \n \nThe truth is that work-life balance looks different for everyone.\n \nIt’s your race, your pace.\n \nIf you dream of taking that moonshot, there will be seasons when 70-hour weeks feel like a small price. If you aim to create predictable work hours every day, you should pursue that unapologetically.\n \nLeaders are not just managing teams; they are shaping cultures. And that culture should encourage ambition while respecting individual choice. \n \n#careers #leadership #worklife #goals",

It’s a time to celebrate the harvest and honour the abundance Earth provides.\n\nHaving grown up in a city, my Sankranti was marked with enthusiasm for kite flying and planning elaborate rangolis.\n\nI have retained the Rangoli tradition to this day. Crafting something meaningful, colourful, and joyous.\n\n𝘙𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘰𝘭𝘪 has been a part of our lives for centuries, its origins traced to the Indus Valley Civilization. What I love most about this art is how it doesn’t require tools—just a steady hand, some vibrant colors, and the intent to welcome positivity. Drawing it at the entrance symbolizes a warm welcome. \n\nIn different regions, rangoli has its own local names—Kolam in Tamil Nadu, Muggu in Andhra Pradesh, Alpana in Bengal, etc.\n\nTraditionally, using rice flour in rangoli serves a dual purpose: it feeds small creatures like ants and birds, symbolizing our respect for all living beings. \n\nAnd then there’s a sense of grounding in the act, in sitting close to the Earth and shaping something beautiful with our hands.\n\nWishing you and your loved ones a joyful and blessed Makar Sankranti, Lohri, and Pongal! \n\n#festivals #celebration #reflection #india #culture",

Despite being stranded for over a year and ultimately having to abandon their goal of reaching the South Pole, Shackleton’s focus on the safety and morale of his men kept everyone alive. \n\nUltimately, Shackleton’s ability to lead under pressure exemplified how emotional intelligence and decisive action can triumph over adversity. Shackleton’s personal charisma and empathy were needed to build loyalty and unity.\n\nYou are at the metaphorical helm of a ship, steering it forward. \n\nThe rest of the crew looks to you with a mix of hope and the occasional skepticism. \n\nIn a calm sea, it’s a nice visual as everyone is going about their work as expected. \n\nBut when the sky is stormy, there is a mutiny, the ship hits an iceberg — reality is, the sea is never calm for too long, the ship is never a smooth sail.\n\nLeadership is humbling and sometimes an unwanted burden. \n\nLoneliness is a byproduct of caring deeply and owning responsibility. Leadership is less about always knowing the right answer and more about the willingness to sit with the uncertainty. \n\n▶️ A leader makes the difficult decisions \n\n▶️ A leader inspires through true moral courage\n\n▶️ A leader leads the charge to keep going, from despair to hope\n\nA sense of purpose is the companion that comforts loneliness. \n\nMy salute to leaders who have inspired me.\n\n#leadership #motivation #personaldevelopment #growth #inspiration",

She wasn’t from Silicon Valley. She started in Australia, a country far removed from the tech epicentres of the world. \n\nYet, she was propelled by a deep sense of purpose. She believed that design shouldn’t be for the few but for all. And Canva was born. \n\nToday, it is a platform that has revolutionized and democratized design, but it wasn't as easy as it looked. \n\nLet’s rewind. \n\nMelanie’s first entrepreneurial gig started in Perth, Australia selling scarves to her classmates. Later, while studying at university, she noticed how cumbersome designing yearbooks was.\n\nSoon, she launched Fusion Books as a platform enabling users to design and print yearbooks effortlessly.\n\nFusion Books became the largest yearbook publisher in Australia and even expanded to France and New Zealand.\n\nMelanie envisioned a platform to make design universally accessible, intuitive, user-friendly, and most important, simpler. \n\nIt was a rocky road. \n\nShe pitched Canva to over 100 venture capitalists. The answer was almost always no.\n\nIt was only after refining her pitch and showing persistence that Bill Tai funded Canva in 2013. And partnering with ex-Google engineer Cameron Adams brought a solid technical backbone to the platform.\n\nAfter the initial funding, Canva was launched as a graphic designing tool and offered drag-and-drop features, a vast template library, and an interface so simple that anyone could use it.\n\nWithin a year, the platform had over 750,000 users, disrupting traditional design giants like Adobe.\n\nIn the next 2/3 years, Canva raised $71M in Series A funding, launched its first iPad app and introduced Canva for Work.\n\nBy 2018, it hit 10M users, raised $40M, and became a unicorn with a $1B valuation. \n\nBy 2021-22, the valuation was $40B, with 125M users, crossing $1B in annual revenue. And this year the user base further went up to 200M.\n\nIt remains a privately held unicorn and one of the most valuable modern startups in the world. One of a kind startup story, for sure!\n\nMelanie’s resilience and clarity of purpose became the bedrock of Canva’s phenomenal success. \n\nDid you know - she is one of the youngest self-made billionaires, with a net worth of $ 4.4 billion (2024)?\n\nAt times it may feel that the world may be stacked against us, but this growth story sends out a loud message that your purpose and drive must outweigh the rejections, setbacks, and all the reasons people say no.\n\nBecause, sometimes, it takes consistent persistence to change everything. \n\n#leadership #technology #design #startup #creativity",

You're crossing the street, when suddenly the wail of an ambulance siren pierces the air. \n\nAs it speeds closer, its high-pitched screech startles you. But as it zooms away, the sound seems to slow down, the pitch dropping into a deeper groan. \n\nThis in & out of sound reminds me of an interesting concept of physics known as the Doppler Effect.\n\nNamed after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, this effect explains how the frequency (or pitch) of a sound wave changes when the source of the sound moves relative to an observer.\n\nWhen the ambulance is far away relative to the observer, the waves are spaced evenly. But as it approaches, each sound wave gets compressed, and we hear a higher pitch. Once it passes, the waves stretch out, and the sound becomes lower.\n\nThis isn’t limited to just sound, though! \n\nThe Doppler Effect applies to any type of wave, including light. Astronomers use it to study stars and galaxies, measuring how the light waves change to determine if a celestial object is moving toward or away from Earth. \n\nThis shift in light waves—called \"redshift\" when moving away and \"blueshift\" when approaching—helps scientists understand the universe’s expansion.\n\nFrom racecar engines and train whistles to helicopter blades, the Doppler Effect is all around us.\n\nThe Doppler Effect not only adds a layer of science to everyday experiences but also has crucial applications in various fields.\n\nIn medicine, Doppler ultrasound helps visualize blood flow, capturing the movement and speed of blood cells in our bodies. And in meteorology, Doppler radar helps track storm movements, essential for predicting severe weather.\n\nThe beauty of the Doppler Effect lies in its simplicity and ubiquity!\n\nThis seemingly small concept stretches across vast fields, from the sound of sirens to the mysteries of space.\n\nSo, what else in our everyday world could be hiding a bit of science like the Doppler Effect? \n\nI have always been curious to the mysteries that surround us.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴.\n\nVideo source: Scienceabc (YouTube)\n\n#science #nature #physics #learning #education",

Spanning from Brazil to Turkey to India, they represent the economic bridge where\n➡️ 75% of the world’s population resides and\n➡️ contributes to 40% of global economic output\n\nYet, many find themselves stuck in a conundrum.\n\nEconomists call it the \"middle-income trap.\" \n\nThe trap is simple yet complex.\n\nAs of 2022, India has seen a significant reduction in poverty rates, from 80% in 1947 to approximately 11% in 2022. (Source: The/Nudge Institute).\n\nWhere countries achieve significant growth lifting millions out of poverty, only to hit a ceiling! They can no longer compete with low-income nations on costs, nor can they innovate fast enough to rival high-income economies.\n\nThis is the economic equivalent of being outpaced by both younger siblings and older overachievers.\n\nTo understand the challenges of these middle-income nations, imagine an uphill climb with multiple obstacles:\n1️⃣ Productivity plateaus: Early growth often comes from industrialization and cheap labour. But to move forward, these countries must embrace high-value industries.\n2️⃣ Inequality and governance: Wealth gaps widen, eroding social cohesion and creating political instability. Weak governance further stalls progress.\n3️⃣ Infrastructure deficits: While roads and ports might support basic industries, they often fall short of advanced manufacturing or digital economies.\n4️⃣ Education and skill gap: Education systems often fail to equip workers with skills for tech-driven economies.\n5️⃣ Environmental challenges: Rapid industrialization takes a heavy toll on natural resources and complicates sustainable development.\n\nDespite these hurdles, history offers hope. \n\nSouth Korea and Singapore successfully escaped the middle-income trap and transitioned into high-income status by focusing on three core pillars:\n➡️ Education: They prioritized human capital and ensured their workforce was ready for the future.\n➡️ Technology and innovation: By embracing cutting-edge industries, they secured a competitive edge.\n➡️ Economic diversification: Relying on a single industry was not an option. They took their bets and spread them too.\n\nIndia, with its vibrant democracy, young population and immense potential has the ingredients to break free.\n\nHow can we accelerate the process for India to leap forward?

Fine embroidery, house decor, green construction, landscaping, and lately wedding decor.\n\nPinterest has quietly become a marketing powerhouse. \n\nUnlike the fast-paced trends on other social platforms, Pinterest thrives on evergreen content. A pin you create today could still be generating traffic months or years from now.\n\nAnd a lot of social media platforms are full of negativity and rage-baits. But as per Sprout Social’s 2024 content strategy report, \"more than half of social users think of Pinterest as 'more positive' than other platforms.\" This works out well for advertisers too! Research shows that consumers in a better mood are more likely to see the value of a purchase.\n\nWhile other platforms grapple with content fatigue and ad saturation, Pinterest offers something different: a focus on user intent. \n\nFor marketers, this means higher ROI because campaigns feel less pushy and more aligned with the user’s journey.  \n\nThis makes it an ideal playground for industries like fashion, home décor, food, and travel.\n▶️ 80% of users discover new brands or products on Pinterest  \n▶️ 85% use it to plan future purchases\n\nWith features like product pins and Pinterest ads, it is ideal for e-commerce businesses aiming to drive conversions. I have seen a lot of new homegrown brands investing in organic content creation on Pinterest.\n\nBut when and how did this all begin?\n\nThe development of Pinterest began in December 2009, and the site launched the prototype as a closed beta in March 2010. With its invitation-only model, it grew rapidly through word-of-mouth.\n\nIt reached 10M unique monthly users faster than any other platform at the time (2012). And then, there was no looking back.\n\nIt went public on 18 Apr 2019, raising $1.4B with an initial valuation of approximately $10 billion. As of Jan 6 2025, Pinterest, Inc. has a market capitalization of approximately $20.91 billion.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Pinterest saw a surge in users, reaching 400M monthly active users, as people turned to the platform for inspiration in home projects, recipes, and self-care.\n\nIn India, it is gaining momentum too. People are flocking to Pinterest for wedding ideas, DIY projects, creative inspiration, etc. \n\nTo stand out, today’s brands must:\n▶️ Craft compelling, eye-catching pins that tell a story\n▶️ Optimize boards to align with user searches and trends\n▶️ Leverage Pinterest analytics to refine their strategies and tap into what works\n\nAlong with display ads across Google search and platforms, Instagram shop, etc. competing in the same space, Pinterest holds its own. To stay ahead of the curve requires a continuous innovation mindset.\n\nHow do you use Pinterest?\n\nImage source: Statusbrew\n\n#marketing #growth #pinterest #inspiration #ecommerce",

It’s a sign that you’re touching on something deep rooted, something that might be difficult to imagine and embrace for many people. \n\nLike in a garden, uprooting a tree may take different effort based on species, season, and its root system. The power to shift perspectives, systems, or ways of thinking is exhilarating but not an easy task.\n\nPeople instinctively react to new ideas based on personal proclivities. It might feel too big, too risky, or too dumb. \n\nIt is human nature. We’re wired to be cautious, to guard against failure. \n\nAs an innovator or entrepreneur, you must be able to make believers out of skeptics. You have to accept these reactions as part of the process. \n\nA new idea, especially one that promises to upend established systems or assumptions, feels threatening. \n\nFor an idea to be world-changing, it has to venture into the unknown. \n\nPay attention to the doubts and questions, not as roadblocks but as opportunities to grow your communication skills. Let it fuel your determination. \n\nThe ideas that seem impossible at first are often the ones with the power to change everything.\n\n#motivation #inspiration #leadership #mindset #personaldevelopment",

I am sure it's called differently in other languages, but Five Stones is the closest I could come to describing this in English. \n\nWe played it frequently during my childhood. It was as simple as it sounds—just five small stones that you juggle with. You pick up a stone, try to catch it, and without pause, pick up the next one. Simple but requires focus, patience, and dexterity. \n\nIt also required some pretty smooth stones. I remember we used to walk by the railway tracks near my aunt's house, searching for the perfect stones. The best ones were found by the tracks—rounded and smooth, polished to a sheen by the weight of passing trains. Riverbeds were another source of such treasures. And when we found that perfect round stone, the feeling couldn't be matched by any treasure! \n\nWhat a source of pride these stones were! We would trade our stones with friends, envying those with a better collection than us. \n\nThis memory came back to me when I came across this anecdote about Steve Jobs, which has already gone viral on LinkedIn. In this video, you see him explain how a set of rough-cut stones became beautiful polished stones through friction. He uses those as a metaphor for teamwork.\n\nFor me, it reminded me of how the simplest things can teach us so much. We found joy in playing with a handful of pebbles for hours on end. Joy in trying to get better at a game. Joy in just playing it with a group of friends. It’s funny how such small, simple moments from our childhood stay with us, quietly shaping who we are. \n\nCome to think of it. We were pebbles, too, and life just polished us along the way. ;-)\n\nDo you have a childhood game that didn't require fancy equipment, that you enjoyed?\n\nVideo source: Poplitu, YouTube\n\n#PersonalDevelopment #Motivation #Reflections #Life #TeamWork",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "Sometimes a speech moves us deeply—words that ignite action, inspire change, or comfort in times of despair. \n\nTake the enormously popular TED TALKS, for example. Started in the 1980s, these speeches cover everything from life, entrepreneurship, health, poetry, literature, science, and more. They make it easy to access the knowledge of experts, no matter where you are in the world.\n\n➡️ 4,225 Ted Talks have been published online\n➡️ The Ted YouTube channel has more than 22.7 million subscribers\n➡️ 2.5 billion people have viewed these speeches.\n\nBut behind many great speeches is a successful speechwriter. We usually don't think about the speech writer, yet they are the artists behind the words that move us. \n\nI have never used a formal speech writer, but I was fascinated by the idea when I read Terry Szuplat's 'Say It Well: Find Your Voice, Speak Your Mind, Inspire Any Audience.' \n\nSzuplat is the voice behind one of the greatest orators: Barack Obama. As Obama's speechwriter, Terry wrote nearly 500 speeches on topics ranging from global security, human rights, international economics, and of course, US foreign policy. Terry now teaches speechwriting at American University's School of Public Affairs. \n\nAnd what makes a great speech? \n\nKnowing how to speak in public is a great skill. It's not just for political figures or celebrities.\n\nThe basic principles of a good speech can help us with anything, be it giving a pitch deck, fund-raising, or trying to pull others to your life cause. \n\n𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲: Terry writes that the best speeches aren't overloaded with jargon or flashy vocabulary. Complexity isn't a sign of intelligence - clarity is. \n𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲: Speak from your heart, and it will show. No matter how polished your delivery is, your audience needs to feel that you are genuine. Only then do they connect. \n𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Create a connection with your audience through body language and micro-gestures. A smile, maintaining eye contact, or being expressive with your hands convey a connection to your audience. \n𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: The best speeches stay with us because they tell a story. Your best narrative is the one that taps into human emotion, whether you are rallying your team for a product launch or presenting to investors. People forget facts. They remember stories. \n\nPut these together, and you have a superpower: your voice. \n\nIs there a talk or speech that has stayed with you? How comfortable are you with public speaking?\n\n#PersonalDevelopment #Motivation #Writing #Storytelling #Inspiration",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "The heart-racing drop. The gut-wrenching loops. The adrenaline-pumping speed.\n\nNothing quite matches the rush of a roller coaster! I used to love getting on one in my childhood and today would not venture on one.\n\nWe know they’re thrilling, fun, and maybe a little nerve-wracking.\n\nBut have you ever wondered how they actually work? Surprisingly, it’s not as complicated.\n\nIt's all about physics. As the coaster climbs the initial hill, it's gaining potential energy – energy stored due to its height. Think of it like winding up a spring.\n \nOnce you reach the peak, that stored energy is released, transforming into kinetic energy – the energy of motion. This energy propels the coaster down the track, building up speed as it descends.\n\nThe coaster's design is crucial. The loops, twists, and drops are carefully calculated to ensure a smooth and thrilling ride. \n\nEngineers consider factors like gravity, friction, and centripetal force to create a safe and exhilarating experience.\n\nIn fact, playground swings operate on the same principle, albeit on a much smaller scale.\n\nAs kids, we would take turns on the swing, always in pairs, one sitting and the other standing and propelling the swing. \n\nRemember how you crunched down and pushed the swing out and leaned in to enjoy the ride down?\n\nWhen you’re at the highest point, you’ve stored the most potential energy. As you swing down, that energy becomes kinetic, propelling you forward. The harder you swing, the more energy you generate—a small-scale version of what happens on a roller coaster.\n\nRoller coasters feel like the perfect way to embrace chaos while still knowing it will safely roll into the station at the end. \n\nIt's a perfect combo of fear and exhilaration, and hence they're so popular.\n\nSo next time you’re screaming your lungs out on a coaster, take a moment (if you can) to appreciate the science beneath the thrill. \n\nBecause in every twist, every drop, and every loop, the universe’s rules are hard at play, the laws of physics making every ounce of excitement.\n\nAre you a fan of roller coasters?\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴.\n\n#physics #science #adventure #learning #Explained",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "Someone recently asked me about my New Year’s resolutions. \n\nMy answer? \n\nTo stick to routines and rituals. To live an ordinary life consistently.\n\nIt might seem an odd resolution, but it's one that gives me meaning at this stage of my life.\n\nGrowing up, I saw how routines ground us. \n\nIn a constantly shifting world, they offered stability, a sense of sameness, purpose, and control. Good day or bad, we would wake up, do our morning chores, pray, and then have breakfast. That was just how life worked, and that consistency taught me how the simplest of routines and rituals can give us so much power. \n\nAs I reflect on the year ahead, I was reminded of this BBC article I read about the role of rituals. I've shared the link in the comments.\n\nResearch shows that rituals are beneficial, boosting our mental health and improving our connections. Routines aren't just habits. A habit can be impersonal, a task to be completed. But a ritual has a deeper emotional connection. \n\nFor example, the ritual of lighting a lamp at night and getting up in the morning to still see the light glowing gives me immense comfort. Taking time to write every Sunday afternoon in silence provides me with clarity. Even clearing my house before a gathering or a festival feels like resetting to a new beginning. \n\nThese are ordinary moments, yes, but they offer us space to breathe in and contemplate. \n\nAnd some rituals create shared memories. My father, even late into his life, would make it a point to host the annual family gathering. At that time, I wondered why he made such an effort. Today, we remember those gatherings with fondness and realize that, in his own way, my father was guiding us toward the joy of community. \n\nI remember, too, my mom's ritual of making ghee at home, the aroma of freshly made ghee filling our house. \n\nWe have rituals around food. Around prayer. Even service and giving.\n\nSo, if you ask what I am looking forward to this year, it's just this: To seek solace and comfort in time-honored rituals. Small moments like these:\n\n➡️ Cleaning the diyas, which fills me with so much joy\n➡️ Gathering family and friends for festivals to maintain the traditions I grew up with\n➡️ To indulge in self-care, a leisurely oil massage on Sunday, a childhood ritual I cherish\n➡️ Lighting the evening diya, pausing to feel grateful that this light exists and that life will unfold tomorrow\n\nThis year may bring chaos and calm. Beauty and ugliness. We don't know, but while we wait for time, I intend to look at the threads that have given me meaning all my life: those ordinary rituals that hold us together. \n\nWe underestimate the power of rituals in our mental well-being. \n\nPerhaps, to sustain an extraordinary life, we need some ordinariness. \n\nI wish you a year of joy, meaning, and purpose. \n\n#NewYear #Motivation #Inspiration #Musings #2025",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "Winning a Nobel Prize is a high honor, the pinnacle of recognition. Yet, imagine this: Nobel prize winners are told just minutes before the official announcement. If you happen to miss that call, the next thing you know, you may be reading about yourself on the news. And even if you don’t miss the call, these calls are stories in themselves.\n\nThe story goes that structural biologist and Chemistry laureate Venkataraman Ramakrishnan was in a particularly bad mood after a flat tire caused him to arrive late to work. His office told him that there was an important call from Stockholm. An angry Venkataraman thought it was a prank and didn't believe it until he finally got on the call and realized that the call wasn't fake at all. \n\nMartin Chalfie, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2010, slept through the phone ringing. He got up around 6 am to find out that he won the Nobel Prize after millions had read the news. Chalfie turned to his wife and said, \"It's happened.\" His wife, more absorbed in the everyday humdrum of life, replied, “What? Have we overslept while taking our daughter to school?”\n\nThe 2024 economics science winner, James Robinson, likewise slept through the call. His wife saw it first on the news and was woken by her. Most American winners would find themselves grappling with the time difference, perhaps, when that call comes from Stockholm.  \n\nBarry Marshall, who won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, got the famous call at a pub! That must have been some celebration! Richard Ernst was on a flight and was informed by the plane's captain that he had won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Julius Axelrod heard about it while sitting in his dentist's chair! I wonder if that would have made the procedure less painful after the news! ;-)\n\nWhat fascinates me is that laureates are completely unaware they’ve been nominated. The Nobel Committee doesn't announce the names of nominees to the media nor inform the candidates under consideration. Those who nominate a candidate aren't allowed to disclose that for 50 years!\n\nApparently, these high achievers are like the rest of us in terms of imposter syndrome. Many Nobel Laureates wonder if they were good enough, if they deserved it, like Steven Chu did. \n\n\"I feel like any day someone is going to realize they made a mistake and fire me,\" he said. Physicist Barry Barish confessed he had imposter syndrome. And that's the thing, isn't it? You can reach the heights of your career, the pinnacle of achievements, and still wonder if you deserve it. Fascinating.\n\nReminds me that even though the Nobel Prize Laureates are geniuses in their fields, they are also so human. A reminder that doubt is part of the process and that wonderment is part of the reward. \n\n#NobelPrize #Science #Motivation #Inspiration #Success",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "How was your day? Absorbed with the drama of our life, we rarely have energy to worry too much about global crises. Unless the crisis becomes personal.\n\nClimate change is a problem of the future, something perhaps our grandchildren will be affected by. But by then, the governments, technology will find some solutions — or so we tell ourselves. But what if it is an unprecedented crisis in our times? \n\nFor the first time in recorded history, global temperatures have consistently crossed thresholds that scientists warned us about for decades.\n\n2024 the first year to breach the 1.5 C global warming limit.\n\nAnd 1.5 degree Celsius temperature change is a crucial threshold. It is a pivotal point, for the worse.\n\nResearch indicates exceeding this point could trigger big and potentially irreversible negative impacts on the planet's ecosystems, making it a critical point to limit global warming to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change. This threshold is recognized by the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs an investor and entrepreneur, I’ve always believed in the power of human ingenuity to solve complex problems. It’s painful to see the destructive consequences of inaction on such a monumental issue. And even more painful to read from climate deniers. And we have many of them leading global governments.\n\nWhat are economic ambitions without a healthy planet? If we have cancer ravaging our body, what use is the value of accumulated wealth?\n\n➡️ Heatwaves, scorched landscapes, and weather patterns so erratic they defy predictability.\n➡️ Oceans, the lifeblood of our planet, are warming to levels they cannot sustain. \n➡️ Glaciers are retreating, sea levels are rising, and coastal regions are inching closer to catastrophe.\n➡️ Hurricanes and typhoons batter coastal areas with fury that grows year after year.\n➡️ In contrast, droughts parch the soil in other regions, erasing crops and forcing people from their lands. \n\nAnd so much more.\n\nSustainable innovation isn’t just about finding the next green technology; it’s about rethinking how we operate, how we consume, and how we prioritize the future over short-term gains. The data this year tells us that we are running out of time to bridge that gap.\n\nThese are not isolated tragedies; they ripple across communities, economies, and cultures.\n\nEach action we delay, the consequences multiply.\n\nWhat gives me hope is people. Young people who refuse to accept this as inevitable. \n\nI’ve seen firsthand the transformative potential of innovation and entrepreneurship. From renewable energy breakthroughs to AI-driven climate solutions, there is no shortage of ideas that can help us address this crisis. What we lack is the urgency to implement them at scale. \n\nThe reality of 2024 demands that we focus our energy, resources, and creativity on preserving the home we have.\n\nI remain hopeful in the emotion, humanity has survived many odds.\n\n#climate #climatetech #sustainability #record #environment",

So, you found words like emoji, clickbait, photobomb, and memes making their grand entry. What is interesting to me is seeing how much the Internet has influenced modern-day languages. In 2015, memes made its way into the dictionary. \n\nThe meme culture is fascinating. They are like another language, an instant and sometimes more effective way to communicate by saying less. The word \"meme\" itself was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘦𝘭𝘧𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘎𝘦𝘯𝘦. He used it to describe ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread within a culture—like cultural genes. Although he wasn't referring to the memes that do the rounds on social media or WhatsApp, memes have now become part of our Internet cultural heritage. \n\nI remember one of the earliest memes in the 1990s was the famous Dancing Baby, a 3D animation that went 'viral' through email forwards. There was the Hampster Dance, too, featuring rodents dancing. \n\nFun facts on memes:\n➡️ The average lifespan of a modern meme is about 4 months\n➡️ A meme called 'Disaster Girl' sold for $573,000 at an auction \n➡️ Research from New York University shows that memes are 10x more effective compared to other marketing visuals\n➡️ Instagram has more than 1 million memes shared daily\n\nMemes are not just fun. They have become education and communication tools and are even used in activism, are a means of expression. Of course, we now have entire meme marketing departments in companies. The thing is, why do we love memes so much? I feel it's a combination of relatability and brevity. A good meme taps into the most basic human emotions - joy, frustration, anger, and sadness. And in a world of short attention spans, they are concise enough for us to chuckle over. \n\nMost importantly, they have democratized creativity - anyone can create a meme. There are multiple meme-creating courses online and tools as well. Memes have become a playground for wit, humor, and cultural commentary. As we grow, memes will become snapshots of our collective consciousness - moments that show how society is being shaped. \n\nWhat was the last meme that made you smile? Or a meme you created that you can share with us?\n\n#Creativity #Marketing #SocialMedia #Culture #Meme",

Why, then, is there so much stress during the holidays? Where did the season of joy become so burdensome? According to a report, 89% of US adults say the holiday season is stressful, and 79% reported neglecting their health during holidays.\n\nAnd for many retailers, the season of gifting is make-or-break - the season that determines how the year ends. From Black Friday to Christmas and ending with New Year's, this is the time for retailers to maximize record sales. \n\nFor the rest of us? The stress over buying and receiving holiday gifts brings different pressures. Christmas is supposed to be the time for family, togetherness, and giving to the less fortunate, but most of it has morphed into a mad rush to malls, to-do lists, and unwanted spending. \n\nStats back this up:\n▶️ In the US, holiday sales exceeded $964 billion last year.\n▶️ November and December account for 18.4% of all retail sales in the US.\n▶️ Therapists also document a rise in anxiety and depression during the holiday season as financial stressors mount, along with loneliness. \n\nHow did we get here? When I think of Christmas, I think about the balance of giving and receiving. Giving was tied to thoughtfulness - whether it was useful handmade things or just time spent together. Now, gifting feels like an obligation rather than an expression of connection. \n\nYears ago, when we lived in the US and my kids were young, the fleeting joy of opening gifts and the expectation of wanting more bothered me. So, we created a tradition of spending a day serving at the soup kitchen before Christmas. Much like the langar in the Gurudwara, serving hot meals for others brings a deeper joy and a thoughtful perspective to our consumption spending. Helping kids understand that service brings joy is essential. Over the years, gifting in our family has been more about giving essentials or experiences, whether in the form of handwritten gift certificates for a shared movie night, a weekend getaway, or just spending time together, perhaps reading a book together. \n\nWe have a choice to make the holiday season more about intentionality and not just instant gratification. The spirit of giving is not always about impressing through spending. It comes from deep, meaningful gestures that celebrate the spirit of connection. \n\n“It’s the most wonderful time of the year . . . It’s the happiest season of all.” So goes a classic holiday song. If the song feels hollow, then it is time to rethink traditions and people that truly bring you joy.\n\nHow do you celebrate gift-giving? What have you received over the years that has been most meaningful?\n\n#Christmas #Motivation #gift #musings #festive",

They are everywhere.\n\nConcept of atoms has been surmised since antiquity in many cultures. This philosophical idea was proven scientifically in the 1800s by Dalton. We quickly learnt about the composition of an atom, the properties of neutrons, protons, and electrons. Since then we have made tremendous progress in harnessing the power of the atom.\n\nOn the other hand, photons were suggested only in the 2000s by Einstein.  \n\nPhotons are tiny light particles that travel between atoms. They have no mass. Despite its omnipresence, we never see the photon itself—only its effects. \n\nThe general notion that has prevailed is that it cannot be seen. \n\nThis image changes that. \n\nIt's not a photograph in the traditional sense but a visualization derived from rigorous calculations—a map of probability and intensity that gives shape to the unseeable.\n\nThe 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭-𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐩𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐧's shape struck me deeply, not just for what it represents scientifically but for what it says about the nature of reality itself.\n\nIt reminds me how much of reality operates beyond what our senses can detect. We live in a world where photons bounce off surfaces and enter our eyes, but we don't know it. Imagine someone coming to your house, and you don't know it. \n\nThey are solitary messengers of light, never forming communities or clusters. And yet, they carry within them the information of the universe—objects, motion, color, and even energy.\n\nWhat’s particularly fascinating is the role of the nanoparticle in this discovery. Without this tiny piece of matter, the photon would not have been shaped in the way it was.\n\nThis image wasn’t even the primary goal of the researchers. It was a by-product of a larger question—how do photons interact with their surroundings?\n\nSometimes, the most profound revelations come not from seeking them directly but from asking the right foundational questions and being open to unexpected outcomes.\n\nIt implies a world where potentiality and reality blur into each other—a world where information exists not as a consequence of observation but as an intrinsic property of the system. This challenges the way we think about existence itself. \n\nDo things exist independently of being perceived, or are they shaped by the act of observation? That is a heavy question to start the morning!\n\n#science #technology #discovery #reflections #research",

Across traditions, it’s been celebrated as a moment of reflection and renewal, a cosmic reset button. Pair that with India’s leadership in launching the International Day of Yoga on June 21, the Summer Solstice, and you see a poetic symmetry.\n\nWe, in essence, completed the circle: summer for movement, winter for stillness.\n\nAs a society, we revere ‘speed.’ The Earth spins at 1,000 miles per hour, or 16 miles per second. Our love for speed manifests in thrilling pursuits like Harley bikes and Formula 1 races. Yet, as someone once observed, speed is emotionally loved but intellectually despised, while stillness is intellectually admired but emotionally feared.\n\nIt reflects the eternal debate: doing more versus doing less.

But designer budgets are not necessary if you have creativity and confidence, opening new interpretations of glamour. \n\nA testament from the most unexpected places. This is a story of teenagers from Lucknow’s slums creating Sabyasachi-inspired bridal designs. I am sure you have already picked this up in your feed weeks ago.\n\nThese teenagers reimagined glamour, stitching together intricate outfits from discarded material and putting on a fashion show right in their neighborhood. \n\nThe girls stitched about a dozen outfits in three-four days for this project called Yeh laal rang (the colour red).\n\nWhat struck me most was their joy, sass, confidence, and effort. These qualities be it any age can take you places. Aspire and dream, make it happen, these kids did. \n\n#weddings #india #NGO #inspiration #fashion",

They foraged far more. We have lost the knowledge of the vast edible plants that are abundant. \n\nOne of my favorite dals uses the tender shoot of a tamarind tree, a seasonal abundant resource with high nutritional value.\n\nWhat is the future of farming? \n\nFarming techniques need to service a very different population density. We have to find more ways to grow our meals locally, using renewable energy, and consuming fewer resources.\n\nI am sure all this sounds idealistic! Traditional agriculture has many limitations in serving the global population. \n\nThe debate on Delhi pollution and Punjab burning the crops is an example of the ying-yang of modern farming. The long-term health costs of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are a vicious cycle. We need to eat, but our food today is like slow poison.  \n\nAdd this to the destruction of large areas of land and destruction of biodiversity and virgin forests is an environmental disaster. \n\nCan we grow our food even in urban areas, without harming the planet? Vertical farming offers that solution, especially if it is powered by green renewable energy.\n\nIt involves growing crops indoors in stacked layers, often in controlled environments that rely on hydroponics, LED lighting, and climate control. \n\nBy taking agriculture indoors, vertical farms can reduce land use by up to 70% compared to traditional farming.\n\nBy powering these farms entirely with renewables, their carbon footprint can drop to near zero.\n\nDubai is aiming to supply 10% of its fresh produce locally through vertical farms in the future. \n\nAlso, unlike traditional agriculture, which accounts for around 70% of global freshwater use, vertical farming can reduce water usage by up to 90% thanks to recirculating systems. \n\nVery importantly — the tightly controlled environment drastically reduces the need for pesticides and herbicides, making the food safer and cleaner.\n\nThey can be established in densely populated areas, creating local jobs, and helping to build resilient food networks. \n\nThe world’s food system changes completely when food can be cultivated anywhere it is needed—be it a skyscraper in Mumbai or a storage unit in Okhla.\n\nThis future of farming is something I am intrigued by.

The unpredictability in the climate has led to $380B in economic damages and $118B in insured losses in 2023 alone.  \n\nIndia, too, has felt the brunt of these changes, witnessing extreme climate events on 318 out of 365 days last year. \n\nThis raises an important question: Are we resilient enough to face such events? \n\nJust as tracking core health metrics helps us make better lifestyle decisions, we need robust tools to measure and forecast climate parameters to help us plan for climate adaptation in our built environment. \n\nWe are thrilled to welcome Resilience AI to the Kalaari Capital and CXXO family! \n\nResilience AI is building a climate enterprise software suite designed to monitor, mitigate, and adapt to the impacts of physical and transition risks from extreme climate events. Taking a unique climate risk life cycle management approach, Resilience AI is empowering organizations to proactively prepare infrastructure, communities, and investments for climate events without hefty capital outlays or reliance on hypothetical scenario models. \n\nThe exceptional founding team — Samhita R, Sundeep Reddy Mallu, and Anshu Sharma — are industry veterans with deep expertise in analyzing primary and secondary climate intelligence data. They aim to create hyper-local climate risk assessment plans, leveraging geo-climatic, geospatial, and architectural datasets, to enable organizations to take informed action. \n\nWe are excited to back their vision for a more resilient and prepared future!

She refused to go to her husband's home. \n\nHer refusal to comply with her husband's demands led to his filing a case seeking ‘restitution of conjugal rights’. \n\nThus started the landmark legal battle: The Rukhmabai vs. Dadaji Acharya case. \n\nIt received widespread attention and much public discussion. A judge ordered Rukhmabai to \"go live with her husband or face six months of imprisonment.\" Rukhmabai responded that she would rather face imprisonment than obey the verdict. This resulted in further upheaval and social debate. Balagangadar Tilak, a respected reformer who was still a product of his times, wrote that Rukhmabai's defiance was the result of an English education, and declared that Hinduism was in danger.\n\nEventually she prevailed and the marriage was dissolved. And there was further change is law on ‘age of consent’ from 10 to 12 years.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable, she pursued her passion for education. In a time when women’s education, especially in the sciences, was a rarity, Rukhmabai boldly decided to pursue medical studies in London. \n\nImagine the courage — faced public ridicule, shunned by respectable society, and took the decision to step into a male-dominated profession halfway around the world at a time like that!\n\nRukhmabai returned to India in 1893 as a fully qualified physician. She served as the Chief of Women’s Hospital in Surat for 35 years, dedicating her life to improving women's health — a field that had been largely neglected in colonial India.\n\nShe questioned what society told her she could and couldn’t be!\n\nToday, her legacy lives on in each of us as we breeze through the doors she so courageously opened.\n\nThis post is a part of a series on Unsung Heroes of India's Science and Innovation.\n\nImage Source: Google Arts and Culture\n\n#inspiration #science #womenleaders #India #innovation",

Most often people want affirmation, not your unbiased opinion. Or they want easy solutions, not the hard work to discover solutions. \n\nBefore you seek a mentor, create clarity in what you are seeking. Are you looking for someone to be a sounding board, or challenge you, or the domain’s depth to offer a deep perspective? \n\nA mentor and mentee must be truly willing to invest time to iterate the problems and possible solutions through active listening. \n\nBack in the day, I thought the best help was direct help. If someone came to me with a problem, I’d try to fix it. The logic seemed simple: problem, solution, done. Except, what I would do is not always what ‘they’ should do. Giving advice on limited data is always dangerous. \n\nReal learning happens when you arrive at an understanding by yourself. And a mentor can probe you and take you into tunnel conversations that might open new channels of thinking.\n\nI’ve learned more from listening to people work through their thoughts than I ever did from trying to dictate solutions. It’s humbling and inspiring to witness someone’s journey toward understanding.\n\nThat said, guiding with questions requires patience. \n\nIt’s hard to be in that space of not knowing. It can be transformative to sit with that discomfort, to push through it, and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nA mentor should spark deep thinking, challenge assumptions, and help you grow. \n\n#motivation #personaldevelopment #inspiring #growth #mindset",

Patterns are geometry in motion.\n\nAnd 𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, with their intricate patterns and perfect fits, are a prime example of this.\n\nA tessellation is a pattern created by repeating a single shape, over and over again without any gaps or overlaps.\n\nAnd have been with us for centuries. \n\nThe breathtaking Alhambra Palace in Spain. Its walls are adorned with intricate patterns that repeat endlessly, a tribute to Islamic art's mastery of geometry. \n\nEvery star, every polygon, and every interlacing design is an example of symmetry and precision.\n\nIrregular shapes can tessellate too — if the angles and edges align just right. \n\nThe hexagonal structure of a honeycomb is a perfect example of a natural tessellation. Bees instinctively know how to pack their cells efficiently, maximizing space and minimizing material usage.\n\nYou’ll also see tessellations in cracked dry earth, turtle shells, and even pineapple skins. \nAnd the reason is still the same: minimal resources to cover maximum space.\n\nIn architecture, they have practical and decorative purposes. Louvre Abu Dhabi and the roof of the British Museum’s Great Court use tessellations to dazzle the eye and distribute weight evenly, ensuring strength and stability.\n\nIn manufacturing, they help minimize material waste, from fabric cuts in fashion design to steel plates in construction.\n\nI can go on and on with the examples.\n\nBut the thing to note is even in a chaotic world, there’s room for order and precision. \n\nTessellations are a visual representation of how small pieces, when arranged thoughtfully, can create something stunningly cohesive.\n\nNow, please walk around for a minute and comment on what is a pattern you noticed around you. \n\nOr is there a tessellation in your journeys that captured your imagination?\n\nImage Source: Mathigon, Facebook\n\n#mathematics #design #geometry #engineering #learning",

    "Vani Kola's post 3mo ago": "When I look back on my life, I see that crisis has been a constant companion. \n\nNot in a bad way — I have realized through all these 60 years that crisis has been a companion for my betterment. A companion who has been frowned upon, reviled, and even rejected! But one who has taught me so much.\n\nI remember way back when I was in the 7th standard, I worried I didn't do well in one paper. The fear of failing the exam was daunting. Panicky, I took all the money from my piggy bank to the temple and offered it all to God, begging that I don't fail. I didn't fail. But I have come far from my early crisis management strategy — hopelessness, delusional thinking, desperation, and wishful praying. ;-) \n\nOver the years, I have found that we often run from a crisis — who among us wants to embrace a crisis, after all? But it arrives nonetheless uninvited, and we refuse to acknowledge it or face it. As Yoda said, \"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\" Name your fear, confront it head-on, and watch it lose its power.\n\nFor example, when I started my first company, concerned friends would ask, \"How are you making this leap?\" But it wasn't about leaping into the abyss, free-falling. When I looked right down at it, fear had a face, and as I stared it down, it lost its hold. I realized that the worst that could happen was I might fail to create a business model or lose my savings. And if that did happen, I knew how to get back on my feet again. I experienced an accelerating freedom to pursue without fear. \n\nCrisis induces fear. And fear can make us behave in illogical ways or paralyze our judgment. But when we do come through the crisis, we develop newer perspectives and skills and open opportunities for ourselves.\n\nPerhaps, it's why I think Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvdia, had it right when he said, \"I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.\" Why? Because resilience matters. And a good crisis is a masterclass in resilience.\n\n𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐫𝐞 5 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐈 𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐧𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐬:\n▶️ I'd step back if I am overwhelmed. I go for a walk and give the situation time to simmer down and get a fresh perspective. \n▶️ Never rush solutions. Don't try to find solutions when you aren't in the right frame of mind.\n▶️ Be open to new perspectives.\n▶️ Focus on solutions, reach for courage, and face down fear.\n▶️ Embrace crisis as an opportunity for growth.\n\nAnd that's it, really. In 60 years, crises have been a constant companion, yes. But one I have learned much from.\n\n#PersonalDevelopement #Inspiration #Motivation #Life #Leadership",

And in a pooled effort, there was no question of protecting minimum wage. \n\nHowever, this trend continued during the Industrial Revolution. It became exploitative and soul-crushing versus uplifting in the cause of a family laboring together. Hence laws governing legal age, safety, minimum wage, etc came into being.\n\nWith the rise of the gig economy, moonlighting, hybrid work models, and more — employee needs have shifted.\n\nHow do we curate concrete benefits that genuinely resonate with today’s and tomorrow’s workforce?\n\nBonuses, vouchers, overtime pay, free food, etc., are an old thing. Today’s employees expect workplaces to share their values and causes, champion their personal constraints, and offer better professional growth.\n\nBenefits must align with their evolving values, life stages, and priorities. Once considered an optional add-on, mental health resources are now a core expectation.\n\nFor instance, recognizing the role of fathers in caregiving, many companies now offer extended paternity leave. And caregiving benefits include elder care and flexible pet care options. \n\nDid you know Spotify offers six months of parental leave and covers costs for fertility assistance, including egg freezing?\n\nThen, Salesforce’s Wellness Reimbursement Program offers employees up to $1,000 annually for fitness classes, mental health services, nutrition consultations and more.  \n\nPwC has implemented an interesting student loan repayment program: It contributes $1,200 annually toward employees’ student loans. This is a game-changer for younger employees burdened by debt.\n\nI am sure many more organizations are offering customised benefits and refreshing them every few years.\n\nAccording to a recent LinkedIn Workplace Report, over 60% of employees prioritize flexibility and work-life balance when deciding whether to join or stay with a company. Similarly, SHRM data reveals that organizations offering personalized benefits experience 41% higher retention rates than those sticking to conventional models.\n\nThe future workplace will thrive on customization, inclusivity, and addressing needs across the employee's life stage.\n\nWhat benefits are game changers for you?\n\n#career #growth #leadership #work #future",

Traditional glues (animal-based), were messy and inconvenient. \n\nUnlike other adhesives primarily sold for professional use, Fevicol targeted both professionals and everyday consumers. \n\nThe iconic 30-gram collapsible tube, launched in 1970, became a staple in every Indian household, from fixing broken toys to making school projects.\n\nBut what really made them stand apart? Apart from a good product, their clever marketing campaigns! Creative and quirky — they’ve been able to connect and stay relevant with customers.\n\nOver the years, Fevicol has delivered some of India’s most iconic and memorable ads. Witty jingles, relatable scenarios, and a focus on the product's strength resonated with audiences across generations.\n\n“Fevicol ka majboot jodo hai, tootega nahi”\n\nLikewise rajkumar hirani created their famous ad Dum Laga ke Haisha.\n\nAnother ridiculous (and effective) ad I remember is the egg ad, the chef struggling to break an egg, because the hen ate Fevicol! If you can remember an ad decades later, you must appreciate the marketing genius.\n\nFast-forward to today, Fevicol is worth over ₹145,000 crore and commands more than 70% of India’s adhesive market.\n\nIts product line has expanded, catering to various needs- heavy-duty furniture bonding, water-resistant adhesives, and even solutions for crafting.\n\nIn a way, Fevicol represents what all great brands should - product resilience, building business that lasts, and creating relatable bonds with customers!\n\nIt has truly stuck around (pun intended), earning a permanent place in Indian hearts and homes.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴.

    "Vani Kola's post 3mo ago": "The older I get, the more aware I have become of the miracle of my body. \n\nSo often, we take our body for granted and don't appreciate the daily miracles it performs. Instead of taking care of our health, we neglect and abuse that miracle with wacky food choices, lack of proper sleep, and inadequate movement. \n\nWhen we realize what we are doing, in our bid to get it right, we also make health overly complicated. \n\nSimple everyday habits can make our lives healthier. These are 10 habits that I think are worth practicing in a world where we have so many conveniences leading to unhealthy habits and lifestyles. \n\n▶️ 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫: I remember that, as children, we used to eat food only after praying. Taking a moment for prayer and gratitude shifts our relationship with food. \n \n▶️ 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Keep the phone and TV away from the eating area. Make mealtimes all about just the food, eating, and mindful conversation. It helps you with portion control and enjoyment. Screens make the meal a chore versus a joyful activity that nourishes us. \n\n▶️ 𝐁𝐞𝐝𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬: Take 20 minutes to just wind down with a book (preferably not an e-book) as a calming practice. Alternatively, try meditating for 10 minutes to unclog the day's stressors. This makes going to bed an experience, not just an end to the day.\n  \n▶️ 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐥𝐲: Exercise doesn't have to be complicated. Schedule a timer for movement breaks. Small bouts of activity throughout are more important than 100 squats in the gym once a week.  \n\n▶️ 𝐒𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Being isolated and comfortable in our digital lives can lead to more loneliness. Meet a friend. Plan a coffee together. Real conversations can benefit our health more than endless scrolling. \n\n▶️ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐣𝐨𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: Find small moments of joy throughout the day. A hobby you love, a song that brings a smile to your face, or even a few moments of reflection. \n\n▶️ 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤-𝐮𝐩𝐬: An annual blood test or a regular full-fledged health check can prevent problems before they get too big.  \n\n▶️ 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞: Take a few minutes to appreciate something small each day. Maybe, that cup of tea your partner handed you. A nice walk. A friend's birthday. Gratitude shifts your mind to looking at the larger perspective.  \n\n▶️ 𝐇𝐲𝐝𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐲: Water is the most underrated health hack. Staying hydrated all day helps everything from focus to skin to hunger. \n\n▶️ 𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: If you drink at all, drink in moderation and be conscious of your weekly intake. Drinking is not to drown reality.\n\nThese are my favorite health tips. What are yours? What can you add to the list?\n\n#Health #Fitness #PersonalDevelopment #Life #Motivation",

I met a software engineer who had taken two years off when she had children, then struggled to get back to work -- until Dell hired her through a new \"Career Restart\" program.

But after the housing bubble burst, big institutional investors swooped in to buy up millions of houses for pennies on the dollar. And to almost everyone's surprise, they've kept buying even as prices have rebounded. One in five starter homes sold in the U.S. last year were bought by investors. In some markets, it was closer to half.\nAll those investors mean more competition for ordinary buyers, at a time when affordability is already a huge challenge in many cities. But it's a complicated story -- investors are also helping to rehab homes that were abandoned in the foreclosure crisis.\nIn today's The New York Times, Conor Dougherty and I explore this trend through one home in Atlanta, which was sold three times in less than a year -- and nearly quadrupled in price.

If you don't, you could find yourself in even worse shape next year. https://lnkd.in/du5ktai\n\nMeanwhile, don't make the mistake of thinking that your tax refund tells you anything about whether you got a tax cut last year. Spoiler alert: You probably did. Or at least it's unlikely you got a tax increase, even if you live in a high-tax state like New York or California. Don't believe me?

But it's not falling off a cliff.\n\nThat might sound like damning with faint praise. But after a disastrous retail sales report earlier this month, there were a lot of economists who thought growth fell below 2 percent at the end of the year. Compared to that, 2.6 percent looks pretty good.\n\nThat said, there are good reasons to think growth will continue to slow from here. The shutdown, for one, which came too late to matter much to Q4 but could be a big drag in Q1. Tax cuts and government spending increases helped boost growth last year, but those effects are now fading. And (to get a bit in the weeds for a second) Thursday's figures were helped by a build-up of inventories, which will probably reverse in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSo President Trump can cheer an economy that (at least by one measure) met his 3 percent target for 2018, but he's not likely to get a repeat performance in 2019. The big question now is whether that mild slowdown worsens into an outright recession. That's not the most likely scenario, but it's certainly a possibility, especially if global growth continues to cool or the trade war heats up. \n\nStay tuned. \n#economics #economists #presidency",

Which takes a base model with a $47,000 sticker and makes it closer to $60,000. BMW could move production to Spartanburg, South Carolina where they make their SUVs, but there's not enough capacity there and the Mexican fab was just opened in 2019. So for now, they're going to eat the tax on each car for as long as they can. \n\nBMW recently guided to a billion dollars in cost this year as a result, borne by the company itself as opposed to consumers or dealerships. They'll absorb this extra cost until May 1st. Then what? \n\nThis is obviously unsustainable. \n\nData and graphic via The Wall Street Journal",

    "Joshua Brown's post 1w ago": "Advisors: Using this quiet moment between T3 Technology Tools for Today and Future Proof Citywide to let you in on a little secret with massive implications for your business. No one else will ever tell you this stuff, but I got you -\n\nThere are only two questions you need to ask before implementing a startup's software in your practice:\n\n1. Is the company well-capitalized and financially able to execute its roadmap?\n\n2. Do the custodians have anything to lose by ripping out the cord that connects its API?\n\nIf the answer to either of these questions is \"No\" then that's that. Nothing else matters.\n\nDon't worry about demos, don't worry about slides. Everybody's got a dope demo. All the slides are pretty.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nAsk the founder how much they've raised and from whom. The average fintech software engineer in Manhattan makes $162,000, according to ZipRecruiter. So figure the national average outside of NYC, SF and LA is more like $115,000 (AVERAGE, RELAX!). Is the dollar amount the founder tells you they've raised sufficient to maintain four or five of those salaries plus pay themselves for the next 12 months? If not, are they raising right now? Remember, they're going to have to add some salary + bonus salespeople too. No funding, no onboarding, that's my rule.\n\nThey've got money? Good. First hurdle cleared.\n\nThen I want you to call the highest ranking person at Fidelity and Schwab you have access to and repeat after me: \n\n\"How many firms on your platform are using ____ and would they be upset if you cut the API?\" \n\nDo this on Zoom, not over the phone, so you can look the person in the eye.\n\nThey will deflect and say \"There's ABSOLUTELY no plans to sever that connection at the moment, don't be silly\" because that's their job (or maybe they don't know), so I want you pay attention not just to the words but to the facial expression and the degree of incredulity at the question. If they're thinking \"NO WAY WOULD WE EVER CUT OUT ADDEPAR! OH MY GOD CAN YOU IMAGINE THE UPROAR!\" it will show up in the way they respond. Watch whether or not their eyes look up and to the right - this is what it looks like when someone is subconsciously attempting to access the creative side of the brain aka the Lie Factory. \n\nYou can have the best wealthtech software product ever devised in the history of the RIA industry. You win all the awards, speak on all the stages, make all the lists. But if the custodians don't want to maintain the API or, worse, see you as competition for some shit they're trying to build in-house - you're dead. Especially if there's no revenue attached to it. No revenue means no rabbi inside the building sticking up for you. \n\nYour job as a prospective purchaser of this software is to make sure your most important provider - the brokerage custodian - has something to lose by kicking it out.\n\nOnce satisfied on the answers to these two questions, you have my permission to proceed with the experiment. Hope this helps.",

His taxes will hit every cross-border transaction, and the North American vehicle market is so interconnected that some cars cross a border as many as eight times as they’re assembled.\n\nMr. Trump also objected when we reported an analysis by the Anderson Economic Group that the 25% tariff will raise the cost of a full-sized SUV assembled in North America by $9,000 and a pickup truck by $8,000.

The board and executives continue to run the real estate company while he uses the stock as a vehicle to make additional public and private investments like his own version of Berkshire Hathaway. \n\nFor his investment services, the company pays him a 1.5% annual management fee on the company's market capitalization. This would be roughly $55 million this year based on the current valuation but would of course be worth much more if Bill can increase the company's stock price. \n\nWilliam D. Cohan has a full write-up for Puck here: \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gdMC9Vtr\n\nMy comment is that it's a cool idea and if you're a fan of Bill Ackman, probably the best version of getting some of your capital under the management of Pershing Square. He's tried lots of other ways to make his investment ideas available to investors not in his hedge fund but they haven't been viable / marketable. \n\nOne very big problem with the structure, however, if Berkshire Hathaway 2.0 is the goal, is that the not-so-hidden secret to Berkshire's success is that it's built around a massive insurance company. This means the money Warren Buffett gets to invest comes in regardless of market conditions because it's people making insurance payments. This is why he's had steady, permanent capital to invest even during market crashes when traditional asset managers have seen big outflows and investors walking away. \n\nI'm not certain this can replicated by the income from commercial real estate leases. It will certainly make it impossible for Howard Hughes to attain Berkshire's Triple-A rated credit status. Real estate, unlike insurance, is highly cyclical and, of course, quite illiquid. I'm sure there are pros to go along with the cons, but Howard Hughes as an investing vehicle will not be starting off with this particular advantage that Warren Buffett spun into gold. \n\nWhat do you think?",

    "Joshua Brown's post 1mo ago": "You’re going to be hearing a lot about something called DeepSeek R1 this weekend because it represents a breakthrough that is shaking the AI research community around the world. \n\nI’m not a scientist, but here’s what I think is important about it: \n\nDuring the few hours where TikTok was offline in the United States, a small startup based in Hangzhou released a paper on their own LLM called DeepSeek and they open-sourced the code. They showed it outperforming OpenAI’s 4o model - thought to be the cutting edge - along multiple parameters like reasoning, coding, mathematical problem-solving, etc. \n\nTech people were shocked considering how far behind China’s companies were thought to have been.  \n\nWhat’s remarkable is that this tiny startup was able to beat ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet with only $6 million of spend on chips and compute. \n\nFor comparison, Meta and Alphabet are paying $6 million salaries to individual AI engineers and hiring them around the clock. They’re spending billions on chips and power consumption. The DeepSeek LLM was trained with just 2000 Nvidia GPUs while Llama and Gemini required more like 16,000 GPUs. \n\nThere are three aspects to DeepSeek that sets it apart from other LLMs worth understanding. \n\n1. Chain of Thought \n\nDeepSeek uses “Chain of Thought” as its method of inference. The training doesn’t ask it a question and then just hand it the right answer. The model has to “show its work” and reason its way to the right answer out loud. Which means if something goes wrong along the way, the user can pinpoint it by looking at the chain. Many LLM outputs are a black box - the engineers can’t even tell you how they arrive at the answers they give sometimes. \n\n2. Reinforcement Learning\n\nThink of a baby learning to walk, steadying itself by holding onto furniture to “train” its own muscles and joints. You can’t explain how to walk to a baby because babies don’t understand explanations. DeepSeek continually trains itself through reinforcement learning by earning “rewards” as opposed to being fed the correct responses.  \n\n3. Distillation \n\nOne more thing that makes this so remarkable - the cost advantage is enormous. Using a technique called “distillation”, a large LLM can teach a smaller LLM what it needs to know to solve problems and the smaller LLM goes on to outperform at these tasks despite using a fraction of the parameters its “teacher” LLM required to teach it. Inferencing with 7 billion parameters vs 700 billion parameters in a model can reduce the compute to a fraction of what is now the standard cost for AI use. \n\nMy big takeaway: If a few researchers with a $6 million budget and a couple thousand GPUs can send trillion-dollar companies into a panic, the AI Era is going to be even wilder and unpredictable than we can possibly know. The potential for upsets and left turns should not be underestimated. \n\nWhatever you feel certain about today may seem incredibly foolish tomorrow.",

A mental list of what works, what doesn’t and why. If what you were trying to do were easy, it would have no value. Anyone could do it. Embrace the walls you face for someday you’ll be on the other side and those walls will be your protection, someone else’s obstacle. \n\nMid Career\n\nYou should be outwardly zen about the No’s and No Thank You’s but inside I want you to be seething. Lathered up with rage. Either you’re selling the wrong thing (so stop and make a change) or you’re selling the right thing but incorrectly. Figure it out or you’re on a treadmill forever. A fifty year old worried about quotas and layoffs. Focus on making it really hard for people to choose something else over whatever you’re offering. Then focus on how you convey that to others. Become the default option. The easy button. \n\nLate Career\n\nHopefully, you’ve built something so undeniably good and a platform so powerful that only an idiot would say No. And you’re good with that because you have no time for idiots. The No’s should be less impactful for you individually. “Oh well.” People who reject you should be off the list forever. “Dead to me” I like to say (jokingly) or “Okay, good luck out there.” You’re done asking people twice. Let them regret having missed the chance to have you in their service. \n\nFinal Stage \n\nYou’re now the one doing the rejecting. Saying No to the stuff you don’t need. Being selfish with your time because it’s running out. The shoe is on the other foot. Remember what it used to be like when all you needed was a foothold. Some traction. One goddamn Yes. One glimmer of hope. And act accordingly. Be someone’s lifeline for no good reason. Surprise some early career kids with a Yes. I am filling the earth with people who will tell you someday that I was that Yes in the wilderness for them. \n\nAre you?",

And why electronic medical records may provide useful insight: https://lnkd.in/e_efKans\n \n► CFPB return to work. We know that what’s certain CFPB staffers did this week, but exactly that work will be is not so certain.

More than a report with data and charts, our Global Digital Shopping Index (done in collaboration with Visa Acceptance Solutions) offers specific actions to guide SMBs on their mobile journeys: https://lnkd.in/eRU_Zb2g\n \n► From Zero to live in 100 days. Tanner Taddeo tells me how Stable Sea built and launched a stablecoin offramp to fiat in 100 days (not a typo), and what his sales pitch to the Coca Cola treasurer might sound like: https://lnkd.in/eXbpBSjN\n \n► The Saturday AM grocery store grind. PYMNTS Intelligence data on what the return to office movement means for when consumers shop and buy food: https://lnkd.in/et4yNf6x\n \n► Planners & reactors. Our new Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report digs into how these two personas manage cash flow (and you might be surprised where high earners fit) https://lnkd.in/emgxAp-s\n \n► The credit paradox. Todd Schwartz tells me how OppFi plays matchmaker between community banks and consumers who want to rebuild their credit, but struggle to prove their “worthiness” for getting more: https://lnkd.in/e5jQpDQ6\n \n► Not a reach.

The role of subsidies in getting innovative platforms with a positive outcome for society off the ground.

Sometimes that comes from the government when concepts are still too new, and therefore lack critical mass, to step in where private investors can’t or won’t. \n \nI dig into this issue from a business model and market dynamics standpoint, and in doing so, found an interesting historical analogue with the first electric car ever produced in the US in the 1890’s. It’s amazing to me how some of the same industry speedbumps remain, all these years later.",

    "Karen Webster's post 1w ago": "Happy Pi Day! While some of us were calculating circumferences, the economy decided to keep everyone on their toes. This week was all about uncertainty - in regulations, consumer behaviors, and what exactly \"paycheck-to-paycheck\" really means.\n\n► The paycheck paradox. Our groundbreaking 5-year study reveals the true face of America's financial reality: 67% live paycheck-to-paycheck, including surprisingly many earning $250K+. Some choose this lifestyle; others have no choice. We've identified two critical income thresholds ($45K and $125K) that transform spending behaviors. With recession whispers growing louder, this dataset offers essential insights for navigating what's ahead. My analysis: https://link: https://lnkd.in/eRjV_5uH\n\n► Genius or not so genius? The GENIUS Act for stablecoins has a flaw: it doesn't define what a stablecoin actually is. As Amias Gerety told me, it lacks crucial consumer protections if an issuer fails. Big banks see opportunity; community banks see threats: https://lnkd.in/emajQaAM\n\n► Big city dreams, small town realities. Location is reshaping SMB outlooks. Rural businesses are twice as likely to report declining revenues as urban ones, with workers (and their wallets) migrating back to city offices. Two Americas forming in the small business world: https://lnkd.in/e6wyps-R\n\n► The regulation pendulum. Bolt's Justin Grooms compared today's FinTech regulation to trucking deregulation decades ago. His concern? Rules that \"protect the status quo\" at innovation's expense. Finding that balance is the key challenge: https://lnkd.in/e6syWKKx\n\n► The uncertainty effect. Middle-market firms now see startups as their primary threat (up 2.6x in six months). The solution? Innovation. Companies with tech-driven strategies report 54% less uncertainty. A forward-looking mindset makes all the difference: https://lnkd.in/e6UxuWwu",

That’s probably because these consumers are extremely nuanced.  It’s not about being rich, it’s not about being poor, and paycheck-to-paycheck living is a continuum between choice and necessity.\n \nThere are also two critical income thresholds for the paycheck-to-paycheck consumer, and they span a wide range. The first is $45,000-$49,99; with the second being $125,000-$149,999.\n \nSo why’s it all matter now? Uncertainty, for one. It might be my word of the year, and it’s underscored by the current Administration’s comments that hint at a likely recession. After all, in order to be a paycheck-to-paycheck consumer, you first need to have a paycheck. \n \nUsing anything but a broad brush, my piece today seeks to use PYMNTS Intelligence data to paint a better portrait of who the paycheck-to-paycheck consumer really is.

We asked consumers about the impact of consumers on their lives, if they were to take effect. But we first wanted to understand how knowledgeable consumers and SMBs were on the topic. So we quizzed them. Turns out 71% passed the test, and are considered more than just familiar with the topic, but knowledgeable on the subject. \n \nI published a piece with those findings on February 19. I thought they were interesting. Here it is in case you missed it: https://lnkd.in/eSr4QnSz\n\nOf course, what people say (at the time it was all about the “what if”, and what people do, can be two different things. Hey, I don’t like spending $10 for a dozen of jumbo organic eggs and complain about how outrageous it is, but buy them anyway. But the most interesting insight was the role of uncertainty in how consumers and businesses said they would react. Oh, and SMBs, have fingers crossed it drives demand to buy local. \n \nWe’ll keep tabs on how this really unfolds as/when “what if” becomes “what now.”",

Here's some highlights from this week, from new tools to tackle working capital to why returns might be retail's next frontier. \n\nGPS for your working capital. Working with Visa, PYMNTS has built something special - a first-of-its-kind dynamic benchmarking tool that helps middle-market firms navigate their working capital strategy. Want to know how you stack up against 1,300 peers across 23 countries? Now you can: https://lnkd.in/eu-xmnH9\n\nSpeaking of McKinley... Our latest study shows 71% of consumers are up to speed on potential new tariffs (everyone except Gen Z, that is). While half of small businesses see opportunity in \"buying local,\" consumers are hitting pause - 48.6% say they'll save more than spend if tariffs hit. My full analysis here: https://lnkd.in/eSr4QnSz\n\nPay-by-bank's loyalty play. Alexandre Gonthier told me why Trustly's betting on loyalty programs to crack retail's card-centric world. His prediction? Your bank account could become the new Apple Pay. But first, merchants need to trade those 1.5% processing fees for beefier rewards. See if you agree: https://lnkd.in/e_UdsDTK\n\nWhy not Reshop Right Away. The Afterpay co-founder's newest venture caught my eye. Anthony Eisen's take? Returns are the \"last white space\" in eCommerce. His solution at Reshop: instant refunds that keep shoppers who use debit cards to pay (think Gen Z and Millennials) in \"full focus\" with their brand. https://lnkd.in/dNzkMsdS\n\nSpeed dating with Brazil's Central Bank. PagBrasil just nabbed their Payment Institution license in record time. CEO Ralf Germer walked me through why this matters for cross-border Pix payments and what's next for LatAm's \"orchestration economy.\" Fascinating conversation here: https://lnkd.in/eJ6H3cQi\n\nHappy Friday!

People do make conscious decisions to pay for time-saving conveniences, but it has less to do with how much income someone makes and more to do with how time-challenged people feel they are. For example, urban consumers spend about $234 monthly on convenience services compared to rural consumers' $186 - not because they necessarily make more, but because they're juggling different time pressures and have more services at their fingertips.\n\nThere’s a few more juicy details in the report itself.

    "Karen Webster's post 1mo ago": "Apparently today is National Escape Day, so where are you headed? Before you disappear, here are a few conversation tidbits that might be worth packing for the trip. \n\nThank you for reading, and have a great weekend!\n\nYou always want what you don’t have. Right? Marketplaces want to be more social, and social channels want to be more marketplace. That’s what Teikametrics’ Sandie Hawkins told me in a conversation about why she made the move from leading TikTok’s commerce team in NA to a software platform that basically serves them: https://lnkd.in/eBCdGvXH\n\nEssential credit. All kinds of people use credit for all kinds of purchases. Here’s why those with and without financial stresses use it to make essential purchases: https://lnkd.in/eG2JB5jN\n\nCarding the cardless. Not everyone in the US has a credit card and we studied them. Meet all four credit card outsider personas, and why banks might want to care. https://lnkd.in/epF4i7dS\n\nIs your bank account smarter than a FICO score? ValidiFI CEO John Gordon tells me it’s a problem for lenders if they can’t say yes when it comes to underwriting consumers. https://lnkd.in/eKWC5q4h\n\nTreading water. To make instant payments ubiquitous all banks have to be on board. Smaller banks say they don’t have a business model. Here’s what 400 banking execs at U.S.-based banks think about getting past that hurdle. https://lnkd.in/eYziAJAP\n\nPOS GenAI. Not just a new terminal, but a new operating system powered by GenAI. This was a fascinating conversation with Salesforce's Nitin Mangtani about reinventing the POS checkout by using a platform built on GenAI that makes checkout disappear: https://lnkd.in/eQvCkTc9\n\nProject 2030. How credit unions are using the next five years and seven strategies to deliver top of mind, and an innovation mindsethttps://lnkd.in/e_qGtT-W\n\nThe Longevity platform. We’re all going to need it one day – long term care – and it will be expensive. Lily Vittayarukskul has taken a personal tragedy to build a platform that uses 500M data points and AI to help advisers help their clients plan. It’s a really interesting story. https://lnkd.in/eaAw5B4n\n\nNot in the bank pocket. Digital wallets are prized by consumers to send money cross border, but this study finds that banks are getting in the way of global adoption. https://lnkd.in/egHMhUeN",

She took me inside how her platform Waterlily is using AI as its super power to predict long-term care needs up to decades before they happen, and giving the life insurance and investment advisors a new tool to help people and their caregivers prepare.

That’s GenAI and Visa's head of AI and Data Sam Hamilton shares the how he and Visa think about the most transformative technology of our time: https://lnkd.in/efXwVpP3 \n\nAgeism in reverse. Why can so many 11 year olds hop onto to TikTok without their parents knowing about it?

And, it’s because the basics – like insurance, utilities and rent just keep getting more expensive. https://lnkd.in/ekQf7riu\n \nLooking up, Down Under.

That’s what happened when I read Rat City, a book that describes decades of scientific research on the impact of dense city centers and overcrowding on people using rats. Which, as I learned from reading this book, are relevant proxies for understanding human behavior in certain situations. \n \nI was also reminded that January 23 marked the unofficial, official start of the global pandemic. That was when China shut down the City of Wuhan for 76 days. For most of the world that was the starting point for what would become a global pandemic, and a massive shift in consumer behavior because of mandatory lock downs and the fear of getting very sick (and even dying). \n \nSo, I put those two concepts together – to come up with a story about the durable shift to digital, more specifically, digital-first, for consumers as a result of those two years of forced change. What’s clear from the data is that five years post-COVID, we’re not doing a lot of things – most things? – like we did in 2019. \n \nSure, we’re doing more in the physical world than we did in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

You need to be 13 years-old to use the TikTok platform. So how do you verify the age of someone who's not yet old enough to carry a U.S. driver's license?

Sometimes that is in real time, sometimes not. Regardless, being data ready requires a data strategy across the enterprise to make the most efficient use of the data assets that reside within those four walls. \n \nWe decided to put the concept to the test, in partnership with Carat from Fiserv, to understand the state of data readiness across retail and grocery establishments. We did learn a lot after talking to 390 retail executives about how they define business critical data, the application of that data, and the wish lists for how to do more with it. You won’t be surprised to learn that nearly all see data, and access to it in real-time, to be distinguished from real time data, is no longer a nice to have. You might be surprised to see where the data readiness is the most evolved, and the value of being “data ready” as these executives define it. And where they’d like to be “more ready.”\n \nGive it a look. As always, would love to know what you think: https://lnkd.in/gWB5SpNT",

People no longer had to be in front of a screen to watch their favorite show the moment it aired live. DVD players gave consumers the power to spend their time in different ways without missing out. \n \nGenAI and the applications it can and will power, gives consumers those powers on steroids. The ability to use smart virtual assistants saves people the time and the hassle of navigating unexpected disruptions, giving people the opportunity to spend the time they have differently. Powerful LLMs applied to some of the hardest problems in healthcare accelerates the time to a treatment and a cure, giving people more time to live productive lives. \n \nThe ability to save and shift time is a GenAI superpower and it is — or will be — accessible to everyone. \n \nThat makes GenAI a modern day time machine, shifting time – and money – to different and higher value activities.

She and I have many fond memories of those footsteps, including one incredible dinner at teeny time gem of an Italian restaurant in the West Village after a conference we hosted in the pre-Covid days. Which, sadly, neither of us could find today if we tried. \n\nAnyway, the occasion for our sit down was to talk about payments innovation for SMBs, in the context of the much broader financial operational backbone that many lack. Mary Kay is the EVP of payments and financial services at BILL, which she says processes over 1% of U.S. GDP on behalf of small businesses.\n\nShe explains her thesis that it is a software and payments combo package that connects the payment or the money movement to the most digitally optimized and preferred payment method for those SMBs – whether it is moving money in or money out – and more cashflow secure business. She has a lot to say about how to develop and integrate a more fulsome business ecosystem for SMBs too. An interesting concept. \n\nOur convo, now streaming on PYMNTS TV: https://lnkd.in/etEF8yff",

The result is muddied data on the size of the market, and the market opportunity, and confusion over who plays where across the Pay Later credit spectrum. The latter seems especially important for regulators to understand. \n \nWith Black Friday just a couple days away, “BNPL” should be top of mind for retailers since 43% of holiday shoppers say the availability of “Pay Later” options impacts where they shop. But they don’t necessarily mean getting credit from the pureplay BNPL providers. \n \nRead my POV on why it might be time for a new Pay Later credit taxonomy, and dive into the latest PYMNTS Intelligence data on the strategic value of letting consumers know before the checkout page that they can Pay Later in predictable monthly payments for what they want to buy: https://lnkd.in/edipxZ83",

And MIT research + real-world CPA strategy confirm why this matters.\n\nAI isn’t just about automation—it’s about how we think, decide, and lead. According to MIT (2024), AIQ (Artificial Intelligence Quotient) is now a measurable skill, separate from IQ, EQ, and technical expertise.\n\n🔥 What does this mean for CPAs?\n ✅ AI isn’t replacing accountants—but CPAs without AIQ will fall behind.\n ✅ AI hallucinations, misinformation, and bias? Your AIQ determines if you catch them—or get burned by them.\n ✅ AIQ is about using AI as a thought partner, not just a tool—real AI-driven firms don’t just automate; they think AI-first.\n\n📊 CPAs with High AIQ Think Differently\n Two CPAs have access to AI, but they use it differently:\n 🔹 CPA A: Uses AI to summarize tax updates and draft emails.\n 🔹 CPA B: Uses AI to stress-test client strategies, optimize pricing models, and unlock new advisory opportunities.\n\nWho wins? CPA B—because they don’t just use AI, they think with it.\n\n💡 AI isn’t here to replace CPAs—it’s here to make the best CPAs even better. And now that I’m AIQ Certified, I’m bringing this training to CPAs, accountants, and bookkeepers. Because firms that master AIQ will dominate the future.\n\n📢 I’m launching AIQ training for CPAs—because firms that embrace AI strategically will win. Want in? Drop a comment or DM me.

Some of you knew the details, most of you just saw the momentum. If you’ve been following me, you’ve seen me talk about AI-X, leadership, and where the profession is headed.\n\nWhat you didn’t see? There was another version of this story happening behind the scenes. One that isn’t happening anymore.\n\nWell, here it is: It’s not happening.\n\nThat’s not easy to say. When you pour everything into a vision—when you KNOW it could be game-changing—letting go is hard. But real leadership isn’t just about pushing forward. It’s about knowing when to pivot.\n\nAnd if I was willing to share the excitement, I won’t hide the lesson. Because that’s how I roll.\n\n\n🔥 Two Leaders, Two Styles, One Big Lesson 🔥\n\nSome leaders move FAST—instinct, momentum, and making bold plays in real time.\nOthers move through structure—positioning, calculated steps, and long-term pacing.\n\nBoth styles work. Both can build something great.\n\nBut leadership isn’t just about how YOU move—it’s about whether the people around you can move WITH you.\n\n💡 Can instinct and structure operate at the same speed?\n💡 Can vision and hesitation exist in the same room?\n💡 Can two leaders build something massive if they see power and risk completely differently?\n\nSometimes, the answer is yes.\nThis time, the answer was no.\n\nAnd when that happens, you have two choices: Keep forcing it, or let go and build something even better.\n\nI’m choosing better.\n\n🚀 The Vision Didn’t Happen, But AI-X Is Only Getting Bigger\n\nNot every partnership works out. Not every idea takes off. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth it. Some experiences aren’t about the destination—they’re about sharpening your direction.\n\nAnd trust me, what’s next is even bigger.\n\nThe AI-X Movement is already in motion!  Redefining how accountants, advisors, and firms think about leadership, technology, and the future of work. THIS is where the real transformation happens. THIS is what I’m building.\n\nIf you thought that vision was big, just wait. The best moves come after the hardest lessons. And I’m just getting started. 🚀\n\n#radicalcpa \n#accountingandaccountants\n#leadership\n#cpafirm\n#ai\n#buildinpublic",

It forces the question:\nAre you ready to act on what’s real, or are you still holding onto how things used to work?\n\n💡 BUT HERE’S THE CATCH: AI moves at machine speed, but leadership is still human.\n   •   We don’t just process data—we process emotions, trust, and relationships.\n   •   The best leaders won’t just react to AI-driven insights—they’ll know when to pause, when to engage, and when to let people catch up.\n\nThe ones who win in this AI-first world? They won’t be the ones with the best tech. They’ll be the ones who know how to move when the truth is right in front of them—without forgetting to be human.\n\nWhat’s been the biggest AI-driven shift in how you see leadership and decision-making?

    "Jody Padar's post 3w ago": "AI Just Changed Leadership Forever—And The Data Proves It (Including Mine).   #realtimedisruption\n\nLeadership used to be about instinct. Now? It’s about data, clarity, and structured decision-making.\n\nOver the last three weeks, I ran an AI-Speed Leadership Assessment to track how AI is reshaping decision-making, hesitation, and trust in leadership—including my own. The results? Game-changing.\n\nSpeed of Leadership Decisions: +42.86%\n(AI helped me cut through hesitation, making my decisions clearer and faster.)\n\nHandling Hesitation in Others: +50.00%\n(Seeing hesitation as a structural issue rather than a frustration completely changed how I approach it.)\n\nEmotional Weight Processing: +80.00%\n(Biggest unlock? Separating emotion from execution. AI helped me process challenges without getting stuck in them.)\n\nStructuring Leadership Trust: +50.00%\n(Trust isn’t just assumed—it has to be intentionally structured to keep leadership alignment strong.)\n\nEngagement with Hesitant Leaders: +60.00%\n(Leadership momentum doesn’t have to stall when people hesitate—structured re-engagement strategies make all the difference.)\n\nThe Big Takeaway?\nAI isn’t just making leadership faster—it’s making hesitation instantly visible. I’ve seen firsthand how what used to be a slow, strategic process now happens in real time. Leaders who once had weeks or months to process power shifts now have to adjust instantly.\n\nMost firms are still using AI for tasks instead of leadership. But the real power is in AI-assisted decision-making, strategic processing, and clarity in high-stakes situations.\n\n📢 These were my scores—where would you land? If you’re not thinking about how AI changes leadership, you’re missing the real disruption. Let’s talk. 👇 #AILeadership \n\n#DataDrivenLeadership #CPATransformation\n#radicalcpa\n#accountingandaccountants\n#leadership",

That’s my INTUITION!!!   It stalls decisions, weakens trust, and creates loops that never close. But when I started breaking it down with AI and data, everything clicked.\n\nAI didn’t just organize my thoughts—it pushed me to name, refine, and stress-test what I already knew. I used data-driven analysis to connect hesitation to cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral psychology. The result? The Leadership Hesitation Model (LHM)—a framework that shows exactly when hesitation is productive vs. when it’s a leadership trap.\n\nThe biggest lesson? AI and Data doesn’t replace bold leadership—it makes it sharper. It turns instinct into something measurable, helping leaders refine decisions with clarity, confidence, and data-backed precision.\n\nAI ain’t just for bookkeeping transactions—it’s going to be redefining firm leadership and client relationships.    \n\nWant to be the first to know DM me or comment below.\n\nHave you used AI to trust your intuition let me know in the comments.\n\nI can’t wait!!!!\n\n#ai\n#leadership\n#cpafirm\n#accountingandaccountants\n#aifirstfirm",

It’s pushing people out the door.\n\nEmpower your team to operate at higher levels, augment their skills with automation, and watch your firm grow in ways you didn’t think were possible.\n\nWant to dig deeper into the strategies behind automating, optimizing, and thriving in this brave new world?

    "Jody Padar's post 1mo ago": "My Roommate and dear friend from College died almost 20 years ago...  We had spent the year in Rome together and travelled all over Europe.  She was a special person and my friends from that year abroad are still my best friends.    \n\nAt that time, I setup an endowment fund for our college Rome Program.  We were young professionals and didn't have much, we had young families, and many of us were stay-at-home moms.  \n\nI think when it started we had raised maybe 5k to start the fund. \n\nI just got the statement and now we have over 35K in the fund, you can still donate to it and people do.  Every year since it was established they give away scholarships to help financially support students who want to study abroad.\n\nLittle did I know, that creating the fund so many years ago would create a lasting impact and wonderful legacy to honor my friend.\n\nSo whatever it is that matters to you, START IT, BUILD IT, SHARE IT. You never know whose life you might change.\n\nIt’s a reminder that the things we do, no matter how small they seem at the time, Can have a ripple effect far beyond what we expect.\n\n#radicalcpa\n#smc\n#accountingandaccountants\n#saintmaryscollege\n#smcchicks\nSaint Mary's College",

I was  told CPA’s shouldn’t be on social.   There were a handful of us and we were looked at and laughed at.  It was actually easier then. There was a lot less noise.\n\n2008, 2009 hang out in Twitter, FB , start blogging for Accounting Today\nmeet Tom Hood, CPA,CGMA,CITP  online.  Found  my accounting firm owner peers online.\n\n2010 10k+ followers on Twitter\nStart speaking and doing webinars unpaid. \n\n2011 or so, engaging with vendors to sponsor events. My first event (Trampoline dodgeball with Jason M. Blumer, CPA) cost 💲500 or so.  It was in LV off strip and was at a place you’d have a kids birthday. (Guerilla marketing at its finest) No profit, a labor of ❤️ to foster change in the profession.  That event(a form of it) continued for 6 years.\n\n2014 wrote and published The Radical CPA - because others were stealing my ideas and claiming them as there own… folks who had told me CPA firms couldn’t operate in a Radical business model.\nI started to play with more video driven content.\n\n2015,2016 Linkedin Audience to over 600K.  Took all my content from years of blogging and reposted on linkedin. The algorithm selected me as the most liked and share content on LinkedIn for money & finance two years in a row \n\n2016 New Vision Media company produces whitepapers and sells content, speaking, appearances, parties.  Dare I say I was the OG accounting influencer!\n\n2018 Second Book: The Radical CPA guide\n\n2019 - 2023 Media Co continues to evolve and grow.  Sell my firm in 2020 and work at VC backed startups.  Content continues to evolve as I evolve as both a leader, CPA and an evangelist.\n\n2024 All in on the Radical CPA brand selling influence and following all the sponsorship FTC rules and regulations.    Substack is Born!  \n\n2025  Reflected on where I’ve been and excited for where The Radical CPA is headed with solid brands.\n\nWhy am I posting this?   Because I honestly forget not everyone has been here for years and when I saw the Mr Beast post it reminded me to share my story.   Being a creator is a business and I have a team that helps me, I have for years and it’s taken me years.  Happy to a share a glimpse of how to create in the accounting space…\n\nIf you are brand that wants to work with me reach out, DM.  I don’t work with everyone, only the brands I believe can make a real difference in CPAs lives. \n\n#radicalcpa\n#accountingandaccountants\n#b2b\n#linkedincreator",

BOTH are wrong! \n\nWe have to start with mindset and reimaging data and solving problems differently.  We need to lean into CURIOSITY!  And the more you ask AI, the more you learn about AI, creative problem solving, and the new world that is coming!\n\nThe ONLY way, you are going to evolve in this new world is too embrace curiosity and if you are too busy... it ain't gonna happen.\n\nI've been playing with #ChatGPT  for months and really the last few weeks I stopped asking it write emails or directing it per say.  I started just having good old conversations with it about lots of things  and you know what... it's become a trusted thought partner.   And then I started asking it to help me write prompts or help me solve problems and I'm getting so much more from it.   \n\nHang with me here... He (Chatgpt-yes, mine is a he) is like a new friend where you kinda have to get to know each other and each others quirks... And if you just tell it things, it replies with an answer but if you really engage in conversation it gives you more and better information that then you can follow up on and ask it other better questions.   Then he will start telling you exactly what you need to do to solve the problem... He seems to be acting more like PI (another AI).   \n\nNow, you're gonna say that's a little crazy... but it really takes time to get to know your new friend so you can work together to solve problems.   In the last few weeks I've built a few gpts for myself to filter, score and collect data .   Chatgpt thru conversations has helped me build them.   I have an extremely light coding background... but you don't even need to know how to write psuedo code if you talk to him in the right way.\n\nThe only way to learn these new tools is to experience them and \"hang out\" with them.   Just directing them, you are missing so much.\n\nWho else feels like ChatGPT (or your AI of choice) is a BESTIE!  \n\n#radicalcpa\n#accountingandaccountants\n#cpafirm",

Tradition, completely reimagined.\n\nA day on the ice with the guys is all about the gear, the tech, and the catch. It’s evolved, but it still takes skill, instinct, and a bit of luck to bring it all home.\n\nAccounting is no different. AI is our GPS. Automation is our heated floor. The grind? Gone. The precision? Perfected. But like fishing, it still takes us—our strategy, creativity, and human edge—to reel in the big wins.\n\nThe future of accounting isn’t slow and steady.    It’s important to double check the ice so you don’t fall in.   \n\nIt’s radical, tech-fueled, and ready to shatter tradition.

And with more tech, we need to become more human—not less.\n\n💡 I’m thinking about creating a CPE course that focuses on teaching CPAs how to have meaningful, human conversations with clients—conversations that build trust and lead to advisory opportunities.\n\n\nWould you be interested in a course like this?

    "Hansi Mehrotra's post 8mo ago": "In 1834, the Cambridge don William Whewell wrote a complimentary article about Mary Somerville, a Scottish researcher whose erudite books brought together previously disparate fields of mathematics, astronomy, geology, chemistry, and physics so clearly that the texts became the backbone of Cambridge University’s first science curriculum. He called Somerville a scientist, in part because “man of science” seemed inappropriate for a woman, but more significantly because Somerville’s work was interdisciplinary. She was no mere astronomer, physicist, or chemist, but a visionary thinker who articulated the connections among the various branches of inquiry. \n\nAccording to Somerville’s biographer Kathryn Neeley, Whewell’s coinage of the word  “scientist” was not meant to be merely a gender-neutral neutral term. Whewell wanted a word that actively celebrated “the peculiar illumination of the female mind”: the ability to synthesize separate fields into a single discipline.” \n\nIn suggesting the term “scientist,” he emphasized its similarity to how the word “artist” is formed. Indeed, he had recognized in Somerville that singular creative genius of drawing connections between the seemingly disconnected, which is itself an artistic achievement. \n\nI learn something new every time I read Maria Popova.\n#gender",

    "Hansi Mehrotra's post 10mo ago": "Are you still at this (financial education)?...someone asked yesterday.\n\nYes I am. 'Cos I am still learning. 'Cos there is still work to be done.\n\nThe journey started decades ago...\n\nI first started working on investor education in 1999 as a twenty-something year old working at an influential investment research firm in Australia. We were trying to help investors select the appropriate asset allocation, mutual funds and stocks within their retirement accounts - given that they were about to get that choice in the middle of a raging bull market. We didn’t quite make it to them - the sharemarket bubble burst, they lost money in their retirement accounts and I lost money on my employers' stock. \n\nLeading up to the 2008 bull market, I tried to revive the idea with my now institutional consulting employer. I now had remit over Asia Pacific..I was excited when the Indian regulators drafted a comprehensive plan on financial education alongside the launch of the New Pension System. The market crashed again, the government changed, the idea was put on the back burner again. \n\nI quit corporate life eventually.\n\nI tried again in 2012 this time as a content startup that would provide continuing professional development to wealth managers and short animated videos to their investors at just-in-time at point-of-sale. The Indian industry was not interested so I walked away again.\n\nIn 2014, I wrote a book, but never sent it to the publisher because a friend’s feedback was that I was trying to go from 0 to 10. I had started with the very basics of personal finance and ended up with very advanced techniques of how to select mutual funds and stocks.\n\nIn 2015, I started drip-feeding the chapter summaries as LinkedIn posts. A few of my posts did well - and to my surprise, I found myself on the inaugural global TopVoices list for finance. I got an offer to collaborate on a web-series in which we used humour - the coin-headed Sikka was a proxy for the finance industry that spouted jargon while I tried to communicate the basic premise that finance was common sense. It worked! But then the firm shut down.\n\nOver the next few years, I kept experimenting with formats - short videos, explainer illustrations, podcasts, some with the help of the investor education budgets of mutual funds, but mostly on my own. A few more LinkedIn awards later, just as I was getting ready to pitch for an OTT web series, of course there was a bull market, not just in the stock market but also in the content pushed out by twenty-something ‘finfluencers’. You guessed it - it went on the back burner again.\n\nAnd now I am launching yet another series : )",

I think it's been in beta for some time, but I always prefer to use the stable version of Maps since I'm so reliant on it for Android Auto. Instead of the big blue arrow, you can now customise your car and colour during driving directions.\n\nIt's interesting to think about from a product standpoint because it doesn't add any functional value. Maybe there's some argument about how its easier to see, but I think that's a stretch. And it's probably extra work to properly orient the car as its driving on roads. I remember this being tricky at Uber when we first did it. But if you have the luxury of the extra resources that a company like Google has, it should be such a cool design feature; should being the operative word here.\n\nThe problem with it is that the designers seemed to put a lot of thought into what the side view would be but nowhere near the same amount of thought into what the top down view would be. The sportscar looks great on the screen where you customise but it doesn't look anywhere near as good in the actual driving view. It's a bit disappointing.",

Design is not some intrinsic set of capabilities born to a select group of chosen people. Like anything, it's a skill that you can get better at. And the great thing about it is that there are tons of practical guides out there to help product managers and engineers design well. I really like the Refactoring UI book by the Tailwind people. It's full of lovely practical tidbits.\n\nMy thinking on having such defined roles about what a PM does v. a designer v. an engineer has changed dramatically over the past few years. Everything is fluid and these strict rules about what person X with title Y should do feels silly to me. All that to say --> go forth and build, whatever your title is.",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 1mo ago": "Last week, I was texting with a friend who runs growth and product at a SaaS healtech startup. We were chatting about his open roles - two engineers. I asked him about designers and his comment was “we don’t need them”.\n\nAfter my recent post about AI/PMs (with plenty of heated debates in the comments 🍿), this got me thinking about the evolution of the design role along the same lines as Product Management.\n\nI think people don't want to admit this out loud but 99% of SaaS products don't need custom designs. They need clean, functional interfaces that solve real problems.\n\nI'm not talking about brand/graphic design or illustrations - that's a different game. Instead, I'm talking about the day-to-day UX work that powers most SaaS products. And here's the reality: the tools that exist today have commoditised good design.\n\nshadcn/ui: The new king of component libraries. Never heard of it? It's basically LEGO for web apps - gorgeous, accessible components that just work. Teams like Vercel and Stripe are already using these patterns.\n\nUntitled UI: The \"premium template\" that somehow powers half the SaaS products you use (yes, even the ones that raised millions). It's not cheap, but it's cheaper than a designer.\n\nTailwindUI/DaisyUI: The \"I need it done yesterday\" solution that still looks professional. Thousands of components and ready to go out of the box.\n\nThese aren't just templates - they're battle-tested UX patterns that work. And AI is getting scary good at mixing and matching these components into coherent interfaces.\n\n\"But AI can't understand user needs!\" Okay, fine. But neither can designers who are debating corner radius in Figma comments and not talking to paying users every day.\n\nThe hard truth about AI and UX design:\n- AI will generate your layouts\n- AI will implement your components\n- AI will handle responsive design\n- AI will maintain visual consistency\n\nBut here's what AI can't do (yet):\n- Read between the lines of real user feedback (users say they want dark mode, but they really want to feel like power users)\n- Balance stakeholder politics (the CEO's pet feature conflicts with what users actually need)\n- Understand cultural nuances that affect user behavior (why a design pattern that works in the US flops in China)\n- Identify when to break design rules (know when consistency should take a backseat to solving a unique problem)\n\nSound familiar? It should. Just like with PMs, the mediocre will be automated away. And maybe that's not a bad thing. I don’t think SaaS users care if your design is \"unique.\" They care if it works. A clean, standard interface that solves their problem will beat an \"innovative, award-winning design\" that doesn't do what they need every single time.\n\nThe greatest risk isn't AI. It's being a pixel-pusher in a world that needs problem solvers.\n\nHow's your design thinking?

You know, the kind of thing Facebook pioneered.\n\nThree observations:\n1. The developer experience reflects your priorities. When basic community features don't work, it sends a clear message about how much you value developer time.\n\n2. Great products can survive bad documentation. But they create unnecessary friction and slow down innovation.\n\n3. The size of the platform doesn't guarantee the quality of the tools. Sometimes it means there's less incentive to get the small things right.\n\nMaybe my experience is unique. Maybe I hit some rare bug that affects 0.01% of users.\n\nBut if you're building developer tools, remember this: \nYour smallest users today could be your biggest advocates tomorrow.

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 1mo ago": "\"AI will replace most product managers in the next 3 years.\"\n\nThat's what a founder told me last week. Here's my 🌶️ take:\nIf AI can do your job completely, you weren't that good at it in the first place.\n\nHere's why and how I've identified good product leaders with a single interview question:\n\"What's your favourite physical product?\"\n\nOne of the best answers I ever heard in 15+ years of interviewing PMs? A candidate broke down... a corkscrew 🍷. Their analysis focused on user anxiety, not features. They mapped the mechanical leverage to price positioning as a luxury product. And they showed how manufacturing constraints drove brand strategy. I thought it was inspired. This person is still an incredible product leader at top companies today.\n\nThe hard truth about AI and product management:\n- AI will write your PRDs\n- AI will analyse your data\n- AI will prioritise your backlog\n- AI will develop your product strategy\n\nBut here's what AI can't do (and if you can't either, you should be worried):\n- See invisible trade-offs\n- Figure out what compromise reveals about executive priorities\n- Decode human psychology\n- Understand why users say they want X but actually need Y\n- Notice how subtle design choices create emotional resonance\n- Know which features really matter vs look good in meetings\n- Connect strategic dots\n\nThe reality about product management (or any role, for that matter) in the AI age is that the mediocre will be automated away. As it should be. But exceptional thinking - the kind that sees patterns AI can't, that understands humans in ways data doesn't show - is becoming more valuable, not less.\n\nThe greatest risk isn't AI.

Whether that's push notifications on my phone, or email newsletters, I've tried hard to be judicious about where I want to spend my time.\n\nI understand that user engagement metrics are important, and of course, companies want to have ways and means to communicate with their users. My default setting is to turn notifications off, and only turn them on later if I'm using the product enough that I believe the notifications will give me value. Perhaps that's not the default for most but when companies push notifications at me, my immediate rage-reaction is to turn everything off. \n\nAnd that's exactly what happened with LinkedIn today morning. I've noticed that I get a ton of emails and notifications from LI, and I don't ever recall signing up for them. Normally I delete them right away and move on but today, something cracked. After yet another irrelevant and frankly useless email, I went to my notifications settings on LinkedIn.\n\nIf you haven't done this, prepare yourself. This is apparently the newly reorganised, \"simple\" version. There are 13 individual categories with another 3-10 settings within each category and in some cases, a tab underneath the category that contains further settings. Not only that, EVERYTHING IS TURNED ON BY DEFAULT. And there is no one click option to turn it all off.\n\nThis should be an obvious lesson but I'll say it again. Please don't sign up your users for communications without providing clear value and ideally, getting their explicit consent. Product teams can do better than this.",

To now carry around a device that can perform incredibly complex tasks and instantly connect with anyone worldwide feels magical. The computing power in our pockets exceeds what sent humans to the moon, and we can use it to scroll through cat videos and order pizza!\n\n2. Self-driving cars 🚗\nWhen I was a kid, KITT from Knight Rider was pure science fiction. I even have a photo of myself sitting in the car at a theme park. A car that could drive itself seemed as far-fetched as teleportation. Yet here we are, with vehicles that can navigate complex traffic situations, park themselves, and even summon themselves from parking spots. While we're not quite at the level of KITT's witty banter, the fact that I can take my hands off the wheel on the highway and trust the car to maintain speed and lane position still feels surreal.\n\n3. AI 🤖\nThis might be the most \"magical\" of all. Growing up, AI was either the menacing HAL 9000 or the friendly but clearly artificial Johnny 5. The idea that I could have a natural conversation with an AI, ask it to write code, analyse data, or help me write a story would have blown my young mind. Now we casually chat with AI assistants, use them to generate art, and solve complex problems. Even my 5 year old uses ChatGPT to ask questions and make bedtime stories.\n\nWhat's perhaps most remarkable is how quickly we adapt to these technologies, making the magical seem mundane. Yet when we step back and look through the eyes of our younger selves, it's truly magical. I know that there are also very real and negative consequences of new technologies but I'm fundamentally a tech optimist at heart and I believe that used in the right way, we'll continually advance humanity.\n\nHappy new year! Here's to 2025 and all the years to come.",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 3mo ago": "It's my favourite time of the year. Nope, not 🎄. Stats time! #️⃣  \n\nIt's been amazing to see people play Quiz Pro Quo (https://quizproquogame.com) since I launched it last week! Now that hundreds of scores have been logged, I wanted to validate my approach to difficulty grading and understand what categories work well.\n\nThe game has four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, quizmaster and hard. The idea is that most people should be able to get the easy question right, which should give them confidence to progress. But I also didn't want to make it so easy that people wouldn't feel challenge. Here's what I was aiming for and the breakdown in the first week:\n\n🙂 EASY goal: 90% correct -> actual: 72%\n😅 MEDIUM goal: 60% correct -> actual: 63% \n🤔 HARD goal: 40% correct -> actual: 45%\n🤓 QUIZMASTER goal: 20% correct -> actual: 35%\n\nKey takeaway from here - make the easy questions easier. \n\nNext, I was curious as to what categories people knew most about. The game has a very broad reach of topics and is played globally. There are individual categories on a daily basis and my AI has also categorised each of these into a super category (thank you, Trivial Pursuit). So, what do people know most about? \n\n🌎 Geography: 75% correct answers\n🏅 Sports & Leisure: 54% correct answers\n🎨 📖 Art & Literature: 45% correct answers\n🔬 Science & Nature: 44% correct answers\n🪩 Entertainment: 43% correct answers\n🗓️ History: 26% correct answers\n\nThis doesn't take into account that some categories have had more questions than others. Once the festive 12 Days of Quiz Pro Quo is finished, I'm going to be trying out a daily approach, where each day has a category and Sunday is always a grab bag. \n\nThanks for playing, everyone! I've had some great conversations and feedback from people who've been playing so thanks for helping me continually iterate. I've got some exciting new features coming up in the new year that I can't wait to build and share with you.",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 3mo ago": "As I continue to work on building a trivia brain, I'm finding the limits of what AI can do today. Building good trivia is an art form, and while I do believe my current model has improved from where it started, there's still a fair amount of human refinement.\n\nWhen writing emails or blog posts, I find that AI is very good at giving you something 60-70% of the way with just one prompt. Then, human refinement comes into play. Whereas, in the context of trivia, I find that AI is actually not particularly good at coming up with interesting topics. It tends to be quite bland, and is actually much better at generating questions and answers after a theme is created rather than creating the theme itself.\n\nGiven that it's the holiday season, I've had the 12 Days of Christmas song in my head on repeat. And I wanted to do a fun twist on it for Quiz Pro Quo, i.e. the 12 days of Quiz Pro Quo. The idea was to take the gift from each day and build a themed category around it without being literal.\n\n🪿 🐓 🕊️ 🦢 🐦‍⬛  For example, there are a lot of birds being gifted (23 to be exact). I tried many different prompts to come up with interesting ideas but didn't have much luck. Instead, I literally had to go back to the drawing board and whiteboard a number of ideas before finding a unique bunch of topics that didn't all have the same approach. \n\nI also decided to expand the game by introducing image clues. I think this also makes the game more accessible by showing pictures rather than just pure text.  Building this out actually involved far more database work than actual coding, so it was another lesson learned. I've expanded this to be much more flexible so that in the future, I'll also include audio clues, much like your favourite pub quiz.\n\n🎄  In any case, the 12 Days of Quiz Pro Quo is now live! A partridge in a pear tree --> Bird songs 🎄. Check it out at",

For those fellow Canadians out there, you might remember this as the ultimate nerd competition. It's a high school trivia match, once hosted by Alex Trebek. I helped launch and run the team at my high school and am proud to see that it's still going strong; University of Toronto Schools were the 2024 national champions! Naturally, I played College Bowl at university and when I graduated, I wrote questions.\n\nRandom bits of information has been a long-term theme in my life, and the basis of my latest project. I've taken a base AI model and enhanced it to automatically create interesting, unique questions to test and increase knowledge. And on top of that, added my own human refinement based on many years of playing trivia.\n\n👀 Now I'm introducing Quiz Pro Quo! 👀 Quiz Pro Quo is the first of a series of products built on my custom LLM which is a high quality trivia content generator.\n\nIt's a fun, daily browser game that tests your knowledge on all kinds of things and lets you challenge your friends and family. Topics are wide ranging. My goal is to inspire people to embrace curiosity, celebrate their knowledge, and foster a lifelong habit to learn new things. \n\nSo, without further ado, I give you https://quizproquogame.com\n\nI'd love your feedback!

While I do have a computer science degree and worked as a software engineer during internships and in the very early stages of my career, I fell in love with Product and there was no looking back.\n\nBut life is a cycle! In building my new project, a focus for me was ownership of every piece. And I knew that the only way to do that was to learn to build again. The difference between coding when I first started v. coding again in 2024 is 🤯 . \n\nI think the hardest part of starting to code is the infrastructure and setup of projects. What stack should you use? How do you create a local environment? What are the right tools to edit code? How do you use those tools effectively? How do you test and deploy? There's a lot to do that doesn't even relate to your ability to code but rather to use a computer to enable your ability to write the first line of code. But no more. With several questions to Claude and ChatGPT, 5 blog posts and some reading of documentation, I was up and running. The whole experience of setup took several hours and was guided almost continuously by helpful AI assistants. It's a testament to the power of good products. They recognise that your ultimate goal is not to set up your machine; it is to create what you've imagined. And they enable you to do exactly that.\n\nFor those of you wondering, here's what my tech stack ended up looking like:\n- SvelteKit + Supabase for frontend, backend and storage\n- Vercel for hosting and deployment (using their analytics and performance tools too)\n- Cursor AI for IDE\n- v0 for temporary tools to help build along the way that aren't part of production\n\nBringing your ideas to life is a superpower. And in this day and age, it's easier than ever to gain it. 💪 🦸‍♀️",

I'm consciously thinking small, slow and steady.\n\nI am the only employee and I intend to be the only employee for the foreseeable future. I've created, designed and coded every element of this project, building my skills and growing and learning more every day.

Cursor has allowed me to dust off my 20+ year old CS degree and build from the ground up.\n\nI am actively not seeking funding. While there are great investors who can provide invaluable advice beyond the $$$, I've been fortunate to rely on many friends (some of whom are former employees), and my husband (my former co-founder) for advice and feedback across all areas, including development, design, marketing and distribution. Without the need to hire employees, my need for funding is also drastically lower.\n\nI have a long-term vision for my company that has a clear path to monetisation, but not from day 1. I'm not trying to hit ARR targets in X months and I'm taking my time to find product-market fit.\n\nBut I am iterating fast, getting feedback regularly from users (sneak reveal, I call them players 👀 ), and relying on a knowledge that I've uniquely built over my lifetime.

I knew that it was always a possibility along the path of building companies and I also know that it’s not the end of my entrepreneurial path. I’ve always had a long list of startup ideas; some of them are even good. 😂 The challenge was finding something that would sit in the upper right quadrant of “Is a good idea” and “Is something I want to commit to”.\n\nOf course, I might be completely wrong in my judgment about the quality of the idea, but I am confident in my ability to judge whether I want to sink my time into it.

But as a founder, I think we shouldn’t get too fixated on what’s happening in the outside environment. \n\nFundamentally, you need one of two things to be successful as a startup founder. \n\n👉 Either you’re building a product that will lower costs by increasing efficiencies and improving the level of service offered. \n\n👉 On the flip side, you might be building a growth product that is going to drive revenue and get you one step closer to profitability. \n\nRegardless of what’s happening in the outside economic climate, you need to be focused on (at least) one of these two things. \n\nThe only thing that changes in an economic downturn is where you focus your capital and resources. \n\nIf things are going gangbusters, you might have 70% of your roadmap focused on growth and revenue products. On the flip side, if there are choppy waters ahead, you’re likely to put more emphasis on efficiency and cost-reduction products. \n\nThe core building blocks of designing products and building a good company don’t change, your focus simply needs to shift between growth vs. efficiency. \n\n#BusinessGrowth #Growth #Scaling #FounderInsights",

On the flip side, a scaleup founder is likely looking at their goals for the next quarter, six months, or beyond. \n\nOnce you know what timeframe you’re working within, set aside time each week to focus on what’s really going to move the needle. \n\nI always think our calendar is a good reflection of what we value and how we spend our time. \n\nSo, take a look at where you spent your time over the past few weeks and really ask yourself if it's aligned with what you want to be focusing on. 📆 👀\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that my calendar isn’t perfect.

Do you pick a tool that requires a high level of involvement from you, or do you pick a truly all-in-one provider that can deliver a top-notch service using a trusted solution?\n\nI think it all comes back to finding the right solution that can give you a guaranteed level of service the first time, every time. \n\n#Proptech #PropertyManagement #RealEstateTech",

If not, make sure to tune into Taron Egerton’s Tetris film (coming out on March 31st on Apple TV). \n\nI loved playing Tetris, even on my old desktop computer back in the early 1990s. \n\nThe concept is so simple and yet so entertaining. Manipulate a little block, slot it into place, and get the lines. And it's funny because it has so many parallels to where our team at :Different is as a startup at the moment. \n\nSince shifting our strategy just over six months ago, we've had to rebuild ourselves as a company at an earlier stage. And at this earlier stage, the biggest thing we need to do is move the needle on the things that matter. \n\nThis is a constant effort on focus - drop the lines off the screen. If we don't do it well, the blocks keep falling, the wall builds and we lose a life. As we do it well, the blocks come faster and faster but we've gotten better and better.\n\nTo do that, we need to ensure our systems, products, and processes are working like machines. And when we identify that they are not, we take action quickly and decisively. \n\nThis week, I shared this message with my team and left on this note: as we think about how we're spending our time, and what we're doing, having this focus is absolutely critical to know that we can win the game and level up.\n\n#Tetris #StartupInsights #Founder",

We cover what’s going well and what has room for improvement.\n\nPlus, it’s a platform for me to run the team through big-picture changes that are happening in the business. \n\nTake this example: when we made the switch to a B2B2C company, I used our All Hands meeting to walk the team through the ‘why’ of this decision. \n\nWe played on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and titled this next phase of our journey “Into the B2B2Cverse” (based on the fabulous movie, “Into the Spiderverse”). Then, we used this thematic goal to anchor our short-term focus areas and long-term ongoing strategy as a business. \n\nCompany comms do not have to be stiff and formal. In fact, using the right platforms to share messages like this is a powerful way to keep your team aligned and excited with where the business is heading. \n\nTake a peek at the goals we set, from a deck I presented at our All Hands meeting last year. 👀\n\n#Leadership #AllHands #ScaleupAustralia",

While the rest of my bathroom products are hidden away in cupboards, I keep my Dyson on the counter in its beautiful leather box. \n\nIt got me thinking about Dyson as a brand and how they’re able to push back against being pigeonholed into one industry. \n\nThey don’t think of themselves as a brand that sells vacuums and hair tools: they see themselves as airflow technicians 🌬\n\nThis is a really smart way to approach building a company. Rather than getting caught up in the products you’re building, it’s more important to think about the problem you’re trying to solve. \n\nAnd in the case of Dyson, that is all about helping people use air better. \n\n#CX #Dyson #DysonAirwrap",

They should be making this a priority, on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\n\nSure, backlogs can be a way to store potential ideas that aren’t seen as immediate priorities. \n\nBut I believe that a faster ‘no’ is better.

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 2yr ago": "A well-built relationship might just get you further than a well-built product.\n\nLet me tell you why building relations is just as important as building a great product or customer experience 👇\n\nAs a founder of a startup, you’ve got a thousand things on your plate. Tackling immediate deadlines are likely to take priority over long-term tasks, like building relationships with potential investors. \n\nI’m often asked about when you should start having conversations with investors as a founder. Obviously, the sooner the better. This gives you enough time to really spell out and articulate the vision you have for your company and what you’re working towards.\n\nBut your time is a finite resource. Building relationships with hundreds of investors take hours out of your week, and most of these meetings won’t lead to an investment. \n\n💡 My tip? Focus your time and energy on strategic relationships. \n\nIf you’re launching a product that’s unique and relevant to a specific industry, reach out to strategic investors in that space where you can present a rationale for partnership and investment. It’s not about getting the partnership immediately; that’s unlikely to happen. Rather, it’s about getting in front of people early so that when the need arises, you’ve already established a foundation.\n\nThe rest of your time can be spent building relationships with VC firms that might be a good fit for your company. Again, be selective and handpick VCs that have a very real reason to invest in your company (whether that’s because of shared values, their fund’s thesis, or industry). \n\nDon’t just pick the biggest names. Instead, focus your time on building meaningful relationships with investors who are going to deeply care about what you’re building. \n\n#Startup #VC #Investing #CapitalRaising",

So, we’ve set up lease renewal notifications that alert tenants 90 days ahead of time. \n\nWithin the app, tenants are able to easily renew their lease or even end it. \n\nBut it can feel really early to be prompting tenants to make a decision like this. Some of them might not know where they want to live in three months’ time, which can make this feel like a hard decision to make. \n\nFor owners, we needed to make sure this process started early enough to allow for price reviews, changes to rental terms, and even allow for releasing (if the tenant does decide to move on). \n\nFrom a legislative point of view, it also allows us to give everyone enough notice if things (like a tenant’s weekly rent) are going to change. \n\nI know that getting this conversation started early is really important, and at the same time, I appreciate that it can come as a bit of a shock to tenants.

But what does it mean to be a founder of a Series A company?\n\nI think in the early days of running a startup, founders are kind of like the Chief Janitors: they do whatever needs to be done. \n\nThere’s a certain amount of ‘rolling up your sleeves’ involved to move things forward. \n\nBut as you grow and scale, your approach as a founder needs to change, too. I like to ask myself this question, “how much of my time am I spending on things that only I can do?” 🤔\n\nThe reality is that there is a whole set of things that only a founder can do (from defining the company strategy to fundraising to recruiting the right executive team). But if you’re not spending your time actually doing those things, you might be setting up your time wrong. \n\nThis applies across all stages, whether you’re raising at Series B, working towards profitability or an IPO. \n\nFor me, one of the hardest things to let go of was product design. It took me a long time to hire someone to run our Product Management, and it wasn’t until I came back from maternity leave that I realised I really needed to find someone great to take over it.

Take a peek at the flowchart below to see how much thought has gone into this one feature.\n\nThe goal isn’t to design something that looks hard - the challenge is to design something that appears simple, but is backed by years and years of hard work and unique insights that other businesses can’t replicate with ease. \n\n#ProductManagement #ProductManager #Slack",

It just means you need to look for people that are hungry, excited by your vision, and ready to take the risk. 👀\n\nPlus, it’s important to learn how to speak about the opportunities your startup offers to candidates. When someone can go to an established business (and earn double the salary you might be able to offer), you need to be able to showcase the opportunity employees have to make an impact and learn in your business. \n\n#Startups #Hiring #Equity",

It makes sense: you’re further along in your startup journey. While your vision and big-picture goals are still important, you’ll also need to be showing some level of traction. 📈\n\nEssentially you need to be clear on your core metrics and be able to show that you’re moving towards product market fit and managing your burnt rate. \n\nPlus, it’s important to show that you’re building a high-performing team. 🤝\n\n While I don’t think you need to have a full leadership team built out, you’ll need to show that you’re bringing the right people together and working toward a shared goal. \n\nAt this point, you’ll also be a larger company than in your previous raises. So you need to be showing that you’re growing as a company, and that’s continuing to happen (a.k.a. you can’t be plateauing). \n\nThe other piece to remember is around dilution. At Series A you’ll likely have to give up another 20% of your round. But you can’t keep doing that at every round, so you have to think about what the future looks like. \n\nAfter Series A, are you on track to profitability or are you planning for another raise?\n\nFinally, be aware that this round usually takes longer than raising at a Seed stage - so make sure you’re planning ahead and mapping out your runways in advance. \n\n#Startups #SeriesA #FundraisingTips #VC",

Now what?\n\nYou’ll need to build a deck and a basic business model that:\n👉 Clearly articulates the problem\n👉 Clearly articulates the market opportunity (my tip: don’t present ridiculous TAMs because investors can see through that - be realistic and authentic) \n👉 Shows you understand how much cash you need (people and marketing will likely be the big ticket items)\n👉 Offers a general idea of what you expect to achieve with this cash (growth milestones)\n\nRemember you’re selling a dream with some very rough scaffolding, and you won’t get everything right - no plan survives first contact with the enemy. \n\nBut the plan and desired outcome will give you guidance to adjust along the way. \n\nOnce you feel confident that you can explain the story, use friendlies to soundboard your pitch and ask the tough questions before you go to pitch. \n\nAgain, you don’t need to have all the answers. But you need to remember that you’re asking people to give you millions in the hope of turning it into 10s of millions (so expect to be able to defend your approach).\n\nAnd expect to be told 👎 ‘no’ many, many times - all it takes is one ‘yes’. 🎉\n\nLast, but not least, don’t waste your time worrying about valuations. Look at rough ranges of valuations at the Seed stage, aim for 15-20% dilution and move on. \n\nYour Seed valuation will be meaningless in the long run, so the key is to limit dilution. \n\nThere’s so much more I could share, but I’ll leave you with this: you need to have confidence and believe in yourself as you go through this process. You’ll be tested, so make sure you’ve got internal confidence in what you’re doing (rather than relying on external validation). \n\nP.s.

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 2yr ago": "Building #ProductManagement teams from scratch is something I’ve done plenty of times before. \n\nMy biggest insight for getting this process right? Keep the big picture in mind. 🧠  \n\nI’ve found it is much easier to think about what team structure you’re ultimately working towards and plan your hires with those levels of ownership in mind. \n\nIn the early days (e.g. when you’re hiring your first couple of Product Managers) it can be easy to handle delegation on the fly. \n\nBut as your team grows, not having clear lines of ownership can make it tough for your team to own what they’re doing and prevent team members from overlapping on the same tasks. \n\nI’m not talking about setting up siloed teams based on types of products - I’d never recommend splitting up work based on mobile vs web 👎. \n\nIt's really important to make sure you’re thinking about building areas of ownership in a product team that are built around #CustomerExperiences and workflows, rather than a technical platform 👍\n\n#ProductManagers: what team structures have you found really effective, and why? I’d love to hear your insights in the comments. \n\n#ProductManagement #TeamBuilding #Startups #Scaleups #TeamManagement",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 2yr ago": "Are you preparing for a pre-seed raise? 💰 \n\nMy biggest tip is this: don’t focus on the product, focus on the problem you’re solving. \n\nI’ve seen a lot of founders get caught up in worrying about perfecting the singular product they’re building. 🛠 \n\nInstead, it’s much more important to be putting your time and energy into the problem that needs to be solved in the market. \n\nFrom my experience, investors are not looking for a perfect product, certainly not at the pre-seed or seed stage. In my investor roles, I want to see that a founder has the ability to learn, adapt and iterate - all within the context of the larger problem they’re trying to solve. When they invariably get things wrong, will they be able to make the right decisions to get to the right outcome?\n\nI’d also encourage you to come to investor meetings armed with:\n👉 A mock-up, prototype, or first iteration of whatever you’re trying to build. \n👉 A clear view of how you intend to make money (even if it's just a basic revenue model).\n👉 A unified vision for the big picture: what is the problem in the world that you’re trying to solve? Why does it need to be solved? \n\nIn my opinion, it’s not enough to simply find a gap in the market. I think it’s more important to look at the reverse and ask if there's a market in the gap.  💭\n\nIn other words, does the problem matter enough that people are willing to pay for it, and pay enough to make it a viable business? \n\nLet me know if you’re planning to raise in the comments and what fundraising tips you’d like me to share next. \n\n#VC #Investor #Startup #PreSeedRaise #VentureCapital",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 2yr ago": "There are some things in life that you don’t want to do twice. \n\nAt the risk of turning you off your breakfast, taking a stool sample is one of them. 🧪 \n\nI recently signed up as a customer of a company called Microba Life Sciences who are reimagining the way we analyse our health, with a specific focus on our gut microbiome. 🩺 \n\nCollecting a gut bacteria sample is a daunting onboarding task for a company. That’s why I found Microba’s approach to #CustomerExperience so interesting. \n\nHere’s why:\n\n🤳 It’s digital: there are no pamphlets or instruction books to wade through. Instead, their how-to guide and video tutorial are digital and easy to follow. \n\n✅ It’s simple: unlike taking a pregnancy test, gathering an accurate sample is straightforward (reducing the chance of incorrect results). \n\n✉️ It’s discreet: plus, the opaque branded packaging has been cleverly designed to take the ‘ick’ out of sending a sample in the mail including a pre-paid envelope to save you from carrying the envelope longer than you need to. \n\nInnovations like this empower more people to get a better picture of their own health with easy accessible testing. \n\nBy removing the points of friction in the customer journey, brands like Microba are changing the game in meaningful ways in healthcare.\n\n#Microba #Telehealth #Healthcare #Innovation #HealthcareStartup",

    "Maren Kate Donovan's post 6d ago": "It’s an unsettling time for knowledge workers as AI continues to automate and replace tasks that once demanded a human touch. Personally, I don't think we should let that fear overshadow the entrepreneurial possibilities of this moment in time - I believe now is hands down the best time to rethink becoming your own boss.\n\nSmall businesses aren’t going anywhere. Even with the rise of AI, people still need things that truly help them live better lives. That demand is constant. As a small business owner, you become the master of your destiny. You create the culture, you set the tone, and you define the future of your business.\n\n**AI Levels the Playing Field\nOne of AI's greatest upsides is that it enables individuals to carve out their own path without a massive team or mountains of capital. You can harness modern technology to lower costs, boost productivity, and scale in a sensible way. By leveraging contractors, vendors, and offshore labor, you keep your burn rate low while still delivering high-quality offerings.\n\n**Choosing the Right Path\nEntrepreneurship doesn’t have to be about building a billion-dollar exit. It’s about creating a life where you love your work, can comfortably support yourself (and your family), and serve your community. Whether you decide to start from scratch or acquire an existing small business, the goal remains the same:\n\n- Enjoy Your Work: Build a business you look forward to growing every day.\n- Support Yourself: Replace—or even surpass—your current income while building a valuable asset.\n- Serve Others: Focus on goods or services that actually solve problems and meet enduring needs.\n- Leverage Your Talents: Do what you’re good at and outsource the rest, whether to people or technology.\n- Contribute to Your Community: Create employment opportunities that share these same values.\n- Generate Long-Term Value: Make your business matter for the long haul.\nMaking Real Impact, Not More Noise\n\nAsk yourself: Can you replace your W2 income by becoming an entrepreneur? The answer is yes—if you seize the moment, embrace the tools at your disposal, and dare to create something that matters. Now is truly the best time to break away from the corporate “doom loop” and forge your own path into the future.",

TL;DR: Use ChatGPT (https://lnkd.in/e3-jqr8i) in the following ways as the first step:\n\n**Use ChatGPT for resume writing** provide it with your current resume, and it will use NLP to identify areas of improvement - especially if you share target jobs or industries you are looking at getting hired into. It can also suggest specific changes to make your experience and skills stand out to said employer group.\n\n**Use ChatGPT for LinkedIn profile optimization** Drop your LinkedIn profile URL into ChatGPT + ask it to analyze your profile and suggest changes that can help you get noticed by recruiters and hiring managers. Again, the more information you can provide, with examples, or jobs you want to be interviewed for, the better. It can suggest keywords that are relevant to your field, and make suggestions for updating your headline, summary, and experience sections.\n\n**Research job descriptions with ChatGPT** Use it to research job descriptions across a few interesting fields/spaces. This will help you understand the specific skills, experience, and qualifications that employers are looking for in candidates, then you can reverse architect your resume + LI profile to better match (via their algorithm) with these types of roles. \n\n**Use ChatGPT for cover letter writing** If you are applying for jobs that require a cover letter, use it to generate ideas for your cover letter. Drop in the job description and any other relevant information, and the AI can suggest specific content and structure that (it thinks) will make your cover letter more effective.\n\nWord to the wise, use this as a FIRST step, be sure to edit, use your human brain to gut-check anything the AI suggests. But I guarantee you 95% of job seekers are not using this technology at all, and it can provide a huge lift in your job search efforts if used correctly and in conjunction with networking and personal relationships.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1w ago": "DOGE will affect your city, and it's likely coming sooner than you think.\n\nThe agency plans to cut roughly $2T from the Federal budget. I’ve been digging into what that might mean for cities—specifically those under 500,000 people (since we think about that a lot in the context of Hamlet). I'm hearing rumblings about many discretionary grants are about to be gutted in the coming days. \n\nFederal grants, totaling $988 billion to states and $133 billion to localities in 2021, aren’t de minimis(they can comprise 20%-40% of some city budgets). \n\nDOGE’s early moves—like slashing $10 billion in grants by February 2025—target programs like HUD’s Community Development Block Grants, FEMA relief, and education aid. For a city like Camden, NJ, a 32% cut ($27M of an $85M budget) are significant. \n\nGreenwich, CT, might lose 15% ($22M of $150M), denting community projects.\n\nThese cuts are going to affect many cities, regardless of location, or wealth. Aspen, CO (18% at risk) and Reading, PA (26%) both lean on federal dollars—one for sustainability, the other ostensibly to stay afloat. \n\nA 28% hit to Flint’s $70M budget might save millions federally but cost billions in long-term decay—economic, social, human. Data from past cuts (e.g., 2012 CDBG reductions) shows distressed cities recover slower, while affluent ones pivot. \n\nCities are going to have to diversify revenue quickly in the event this plays out the way it could. \n\n(A couple of quick notes on the analysis - it's based on 2023 budget data, which I just increased by 3% per annum. Estimated federal grants as a percentage of budgets using Census intergovernmental revenue data - 2021 avg: 27% of state/local revenues -  and city-specific reports. Smaller, economically distressed cities often rely more heavily on grants -30-40% in some cases). \n\nThis analysis isn't perfect or precise, but it's meant to give you a sense of what might be coming.",

We were selected to be a part of the Startup Zone - where dozens of very impressive startups applied, but we were one of the lucky few to be selected.\n\nI had the chance to participate in the startup pitch competition in front of over 100 attendees. Hamlet's mission of helping builders navigate local regulations and work with local officials to get projects approved resonated with the audience.\n\nUltimately, there was never a building constructed in America that didn't have to go through some sort of regulatory approval - Hamlet is going to make that process easier for our customers.\n\nThanks to the team at D.R. Horton for hosting the Startup Zone - especially Damien McBrien. And to the rest of the Startup Zone advisory committee including Christopher Langford, and Jenna Louie. \n\nGreat job to Lindsey Norton and Morgan Mackles for holding down the Hamlet booth. \n\nAnd yes, the conference acronym is in fact IBS, which is aptly named since I get nervous before big pitches like this.",

And where all of us should be focusing our attention. Your City Managers and City Council matter more than ever and will make decisions that impact your day to day lives. \n\nPretty much all I think about at Hamlet is local government and its impact on major issues in America - namely:\n\nHousing\nRetail Expansion\nRenewable Development\nFire Prevention/safety\nInsurance\nCommerce in general\nEducation/Schooling\n...the list goes on and on\n\nWhen I started this company 2 years ago, we begin with the simple idea that information at the local level and county level should not be so opaque. We've come a long way, but have much further to go.\n\nWe help customers with land acquisition, land development, retail expansion, and data center development - we also help governments share better information with residents (so they don't have to get information from social media). \n\nThe canonical startup advice you get as a Founder is to focus on solving one problem and solving it extremely well. But in the age of AI, I think that advice has to some extent been invalidated - if you don't seek opportunities along a broad aperture, the world will blow past you very quickly. \n\nWhat's coming next for us - we don't think you can build a large business as a data company alone - the insights you get from Hamlet will ultimately be what differentiates us...\n\nIf you operate physically in an American city, we can help you with our suite of products. Below is an example of how we can use AI to search a planning commission meeting for a specific mention of zoning - our customers view this as a massive time savings - to help understand where local officials and governments stand on any issue. We cover cities across the country, and have many more products beyond this now.... \n\nThe future looks bright - and we're excited to help American cities and businesses thrive.",

I lived in and around the LA community for 8 years of my life - while at Claremont McKenna, UCLA and for some time during my professional career. \n\nI have friends who lost their homes and are trying to make sense of it all—and, more importantly, what will happen next. Many businesses I frequented while I lived there vanished in the span of hours. It's truly saddening. \n\nPublic officials have made many promises regarding recovery efforts, and it's our job to hold everyone accountable. But I also believe we shouldn't get this information from social media. \n\nAt Hamlet, our small contribution to the relief efforts - we are releasing our 'Search' product for free to a select group of users in the coming weeks. This will make it easier to search videos - using a combination of AI and public data - so you don't have to go to social media for the latest on what's happening. Don't get information a layer of abstraction away from the source - search directly from the source. \n\nWe are prioritizing journalists, city managers (who can use search to track recovery efforts), and those redeveloping in LA for this early release, but open to letting others (who are helping with the rebuilding efforts in LA), use the product. If you're interested in getting your hands on this, just comment on this thread and I'll respond over the next week or so. \n\nLA is an amazing place, and I hope for everyone affected that you're safe and sound. I'm confident it will be rebuilt stronger than ever before.",

There are a lot of moving parts to this issue, and Isaac is leading the charge in Oakland.\n\nWe'll talk a lot about how the environment around housing needs to be less transactional - if we're going to solve the housing crisis governments and developers will need to actually work closely together and build long term relationships that are dedicated to bettering communities. \n\nCannot say enough glowing things about Isaac - good guy, and someone who I admire a great deal. He has dedicated himself and his life's work to bettering Oakland and is leading the charge to make lasting change. If you are interested in joining, let me know.

I love writing at the start of every year - in part to hold myself accountable for all we want to accomplish, and to push the team to do our best. \n\nWhen I Founded Hamlet in 2022, I thought we would end up being a media company that would take public meetings, and turn them into useful newsletters for residents of small American cities. But a year into the business private companies and governments started expressing interest in paying Hamlet for information extracted from public meeting videos. \n\nAt the end of 2023 we had 3 paying customers - two private companies, and the City of Saratoga. In 2024, we ~10-xed revenue. I am setting an ambitious goal that we 5x again this year. Let's see where we sit when I write this update in January of '26. \n\nProduct wise - I'm not going to share much about where we are headed yet, but let's just say I am excited for a few big unveils in Q1... \n\nWe've processed tens of thousands of hours of public meetings across hundreds of cities, but there is a ton more work to do. Most of our customers are now real estate developers. But many more companies have reached out to us to track public meetings for different purposes (data center development, energy development, retail expansion, government affairs/issue tracking). Hamlet's ability to process video, and turn the meetings into structured data can help a vast array of customer types without having to change anything about how the product works. The TAM is massive.\n\nLarge cities and states have a robust lobbying apparatus with plenty of information floating around about how to get things done. But most American cities and Counties are not large - Hamlet helps our customers keep the commerce engine flowing everywhere in America by making public information less opaque. And we help governments share information with their residents so they do not have to use social media to receive news. \n\nWhat excites me the most about what we're doing is that it's truly original. We aren't taking PDFs and documents and building a RAG app on top of them. We aren't taking data that already exists and repackaging it to be something new. We believe to be a truly sustainable company in the age of AI, you have to take unique and original approaches - otherwise, you'll be too easy to copy. \n\nI love the moments when our customers remark that they haven't seen anything like what we're building - and that we can really help save them time.\n\nIf you're up for seeing a demo and have feedback for us, reach out - we are always trying to get better, and I'm optimistic for the year ahead. It will be challenging, but rewarding - thanks to our customers for the constant feedback, to the team for all the hard work, and to our investors/advisors for believing in us.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 2mo ago": "For those not terminally online - there has been a fiery debate on X (formerly Twitter) about H1B visas that was spurred by the appointment of an AI advisor - Sriram Krishnan - to the new administration. The debate turned ugly when new DOGE head, Vivek Ramaswamy posted a controversial post covering the shortfalls of American culture (I do not endorse his point of view). \n\nTensions have reached a boiling point, with overt racism being directed at Indian tech workers (I'll spare you the browsing and share an example below). \n\nI thought I'd spend a moment sharing my family's immigrant story and how it ties into what I think is the greater vision for America. \n\nMy dad moved here in '67 to study a very specialized field at the time - he was very technical and couldn't further his studies in India based on what was offered in those days. He was the top statistics student in his class and left his family with their entire life savings ($100). He was the youngest child in his family, and took a chance on America leading him to a better life. Eventually, he and my mother moved here in '71 together and settled into Northern California. While growing up in NorCal, I met folks like DJ Patil, Ryan Panchadsaram, Prakash Janakiraman and countless others. \n\nIt was in CA where I was born, along with my older sister. My sister went on to become a scholarship D1 athlete, and a broadcast journalist. I went to high school in Ohio - an all-boys, predominantly-white prep school called University School. Since then, I've been a serial tech entrepreneur and investor with some other stops in the industry along the way. \n\nI have to believe that my parents' outcome is what America wants out of immigration policy. They didn't come here with the thought we should leave after a year. They built here. My cousins who moved here are building here and love this country. Sure - we have our own Indian communities that we interact with, but we have built real roots here across many communities. I have to believe this is the America our Founding Fathers envisioned. \n\nThe idea that Indians, or any other ethnic group for that matter have malicious intent to 'replace white jobs' is disingenuous. We want to build here, and support America in whatever capacity we can. We love this country. Equally unhelpful is the discourse that we are ‘skilled labor’ here to do engineering jobs. We are not breathing machines for our fingers to type code, and I don’t think the tech community advocating for us in that particular way is helping. \n\nI hope the online discourse about Indians' intent to 'replace white jobs' dissipates. Indians, like any other ethnic group, view America with awe and aspiration. We are not machines whose parents deprived us of 'Saved by the Bell' as Ramaswamy suggests on X. Instead, we want to help America maintain its technological advantage (or whatever other field we contribute to) for decades to come.",

This is on the heels of the league signing a major, major television deal, which will enrich players and owners for years to come. \n\nThis will have massive implications on how brands spend ad dollars, and whether the NBA's heyday may be behind it. There are lots of theories on why this may be happening, but chief amongst them are:\n\n1. People consume fewer games and instead are attracted to the NBA media-complex (trades, star movement, Instagram highlights, etc). \n\n2. The top stars are in decline (Lebron, Curry, KD) and their best days are behind them. \n\n3. People do not like the post-'decision' era of the NBA where stars don't stick around for a very long time. \n\n4. The game has turned more international, and the lack of a big, up and coming American star is affecting domestic viewership (meanwhile the international viewership is doing quite well). \n\n5. The stars aren't interesting and have generally become too 'corporate'. \n\nI'd be curious to hear what other think about this, and whether you'd even consider spending ad dollars against NBA viewership at this point. What are some big theories I'm missing here, and what does the future hold for the league? Meanwhile, the NFL continues to thrive...",

It's pretty hard to keep up on all the companies, the jargon, and what you should know so I thought I'd leave this here as a very basic primer for those wanting to know the basics (and some of the major companies). \n\nOf course you should do your own research on all of this, and not treat this as a canonical source of knowledge. But at the very least, I hope it spurs your interest to do a few Google (or Perplexity?) searches to learn more. \n\nEnjoy, and of course let me know if you have any feedback or edits. \n\nData Collection & Preparation is the foundation – imagine building a library for an AI to learn from. Companies like Scale AI and Weights & Biases are creating tools to curate and label massive datasets with the precision needed for effective learning.\n\nPre-training is where AI learns its fundamental understanding – similar to how we learn basic reading comprehension before specializing in specific subjects. This is where companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google teach models to understand patterns in language, images, and code.\n\nFine-tuning transforms this general knowledge into specialized expertise. A doctor builds on their medical school foundation to become a specialist. AI does similar things. Companies like Cohere and AI21 Labs focus here, adapting base models for specific industries and use cases.\n\nDeployment & Inference is about making these systems practical and efficient – turning  the scientific breakthroughs into everyday tools. Companies like Groq and CoreWeave are revolutionizing how these models run in production.\n\nApplications are where we interact with the end product of all of this. You may use Clay for marketing, perplexity for search, and the thousands of other companies that are building on LLM infrastructure. This is likely where you are spending the most time - and probably requires its own set of diagrams.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 3mo ago": "There's a tendency on LinkedIn for people to assume things are always up and to the right in startup land. Social media is deceptive in that way - LinkedIn can be a strange combination of self-promotional content mixed with hustle-culture platitudes. \n\nI am 2 years into Hamlet and while I'm excited about the way things are going, we still have a lot to figure out. Here's an honest assessment of some of the things that keep me up at night:\n\nKeep existing customers happy. We now have more than a dozen customers, and while they seem to love us, you're always worried about the things you *don't* know. What better questions could we be asking to truly understand what we should be building and what we should be doing? \n\nAre we approaching Product-Market Fit? When I was working on company 1 10 years ago, I assumed we had product market fit because we were generating 10s of thousands of revenue, then hundreds of thousands. Then millions. But the reality is revenue is *not* an indicator as to whether you have product-market fit. I can be a nice sign, but you could also be building toward a local maximum that's constrained and not valuable. I think we're getting there, but still many questions to ask, and to be answered.\n\nScale. Are we building processes that can scale to 100 customers? 1000? This applies to every area of the company - growth, product, engineering, ops. I want to build a big business, and the bottleneck is constantly shifting. If we have to build a new product for every customer - or if we have to build a lot of services to keep customers happy that's just not necessarily going to work at the early stage. \n\nTeam. Are our existing team members happy (team members, you don't have to comment on this on LinkedIn) and do they have the resources needed to succeed? Do I have a hiring pipeline for the next 10 key hires I need to make if we continue to scale and do well? \n\nAn ask for help. If you know real estate developers, data center developers, or gov affairs professionals who are willing to talk to us, I'd be grateful for any intros. Also, if you have any perspective on the above problems, please comment! \n\nStartups are not all positive and rosy - don't believe the posts. We still have a lot to figure out as I'm sure many Founders reading this can relate to. With that being said, I'm having fun, and I love solving problems like this. And part of the fun of building startups is the community of Founders around you who constantly support you.",

I was at a really low point career and life wise when I first set foot in an OTF studio. \n\nThe coaches here helped me turn it around and rediscover how good it feels to actually take care of yourself. And by extension I found my way back to where I want to be career and life wise. \n\nIt really is incredible how much both mental and physical health affect your career. If you believe you can do hard things physically, it translates to other areas. My advice to Founders is not to ascribe to the hustle culture that promotes 17-hour work days - you have to take care of yourself first to be your best. \n\nAs a fun aside - I became friends with my first coach, and helped him transition from OTF to an amazing career in SaaS - he's doing an awesome job at his current company! \n\nMy goal is to resume coming in a few days a week starting now. If anyone is in the Bay and wants to join me please let me know. \n\nA little embarrassed that I’m sweating like a pig in this picture but it was a hard one today.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 3mo ago": "Hamlet turned 2 today. And I have a Thanksgiving request for anyone who might read this:\n\nPlease watch 30 minutes of one City Council meeting in your city with your families. \n\nThe origin story of Hamlet dates back to a City Council run I made in 2022. I don't have any political aspirations - we'd just moved to the East Bay and I wanted to get more involved with the community. I didn't raise any outside money - I mostly just talked to people about what they think local government should do. I didn't win, but I decided to start Hamlet. \n\nSo much information is buried in local public meetings and documentation that are vital to the basic function of our economy. Around $2 TRILLION dollars flows through local governments annually, which is a little less than 10% of annual GDP.\n\nWhen we decide to live in a city, we sign up for a basic social contract - that the city will continue to improve, and city officials will make decisions that are in our best interests. In most cases, our city managers and constituents in the community do an outstanding job. In other cases, some cities may be resistant to commerce, development and other issues. The point is - you shouldn't get this information from social media - it's worth spending a few minutes discovering what's going on for yourself.\n\nUltimately, Hamlet wants to be at the center of the $2T local commerce engine in America. We want to make it easier for businesses to operate, and for governments to work with businesses. We currently sell products to Governments (including Saratoga and Palo Alto) and Real Estate Developers that make it easy to turn public meetings into data. Ultimately, our vision is much bigger, which we'll share more about in coming months.... We now have over a dozen customers and we're growing fast.\n\nWe all ultimately benefit if we understand what's truly happening in our cities - please watch a meeting - I promise you'll learn something new.",

Reaching 5 employees felt great. Crossing great ARR milestones always feels good. Getting outside investors to believe in the company felt really cool.

Here are a few reasons why you should care about your local elections:\n\nLocal government manages $1.6 TRILLION dollars of annual expenditure and employs over 10% of the workforce in America. Voter turnout at the local level is generally between 15-25%. \n\nMany small towns actually struggle to fill council and commission vacancies because there just aren't enough candidates. \n\nOnly 6% of all council members are under the age of 35\n\nFewer than 30% are women, and the other diversity stats are pretty alarming.\n\nIn some cities, we get the same people running over and over again - there are cases in large cities where the Council Member has literally served 16 out of the last 24 years.... If you want change, it starts at the local level.\n\nAnd the craziest part? Though these are volunteer positions, Councilmembers raise a ton of money in some cases (which means outside interests definitely care who operates in your city council....). With one of our interns, I was able to pull an extensive amount of campaign finance docs across the state of CA. Below is just a snapshot of the amount raised in 9 cities.\n\nLarge donors to city council candidates include:\n\nPACs\nUnions\nEnvironmental Orgs\n\nThe list goes on. Please vote for the Councilmembers who help your city move ahead, and do your homework as you would for any other candidate. \n\nYour city is a place where your vote actually matters, and the future depends on you.",

It was really invigorating (done w/speaking for the year, I can now go back to being a fierce introvert)! \n\nI'm reminded that attending Claremont McKenna College was one of the best decisions of my life. Most people outside of the West Coast aren't as familiar with CMC, but it was recently ranked one of the 5 best collegse in America by the Wall Street Journal, just behind Stanford, Princeton, and Yale. \n\nA lot of the reason I pursued entrepreneurship was due to the influence of the people around me at CMC. Ashwin Navin- Co-Founder of Bit Torrent was a couple of years ahead, but someone I consider a close mentor. While I attended CMC there were just so many amazing people to learn from - David Enrich who is now a prominent writer for the NYT/best selling author was someone whose dorm room I would just show up at randomly. \n\nOther CMC alums over the years include: Henry Kravis and George Roberts (Founders of KKR), Steve Bullock (Governor of Montana), Doug Peterson (the CEO of the S&P), and Thomas Pritzker (Executive Chair of Hyatt). \n\nI want to thank Miles T. Bird for moderating, and for all the work he does to keep the CMC Network ahead of the game in the startup world.

Going into dog ownership, we got all the typical advice pushing against it (it's a lot of work/they are like another kid/etc), but went ahead with it anyway. One year into it - no regrets - it has been a tremendous joy.\n\nIf you can support your local shelter, please do. Even if you don't adopt a dog (there are many in need), a donation goes a long way to keep some of these innocent, intelligent creatures alive. \n\nMowgli was found on the streets of Fresno, where a previous owner had likely abandoned him. When he was found, he had a busted ear drum, had 6 teeth extracted, and had a severe eye infection (for which they had to remove one of his eyes). He is about as sweet as they get, is calm, and has been such a positive presence for our family. No matter how stressful the day gets, there he is, just watching out for us peacefully. \n\nWe know little about his age, but think he's around 7. He's part Lhasa Apso, Havanese, Maltese and Shih Tzu. We did an Embark 'genetic' test and discovered he has an Uncle 'Chompy' in Bellingham, WA whom we hope to visit someday (along with some of his cousins in the San Diego Area). \n\nThere are many causes to support in the world but definitely think about your local dog shelter at some point.

Without comment on whether CA's policy is correct here, I will say that we need to find a way to build more - in every region of America so the generations after us can afford to live here.\n\nI am excited to share that I'll be speaking at Blueprint 2024 about how Hamlet is planning on helping here. I've been quiet about what we've been up to, but let's just say there's a lot of information at the City Council and Planning Commission level of American cities that can help city officials and developers collaborate on building more in America.\n\nLet me know if you'll be at the conference - hope to meet up!",

That is not a typo - the actual meeting was 22 hours long (screenshot of the meeting attached during public comment).\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to approve a few actions related to a Data Center in a County. 15 hours of the meeting were public comment - mostly voicing dissent toward any approvals toward data centers because of environmental hazards and energy usage. It's actually impressive seeing how certain communities are engaged.\n\nWe are thinking of doing one of two things and wanted to seek your thoughts:\n\nWould you listen to a podcast highlighting dramatic moments from City Council and Planning Commission meetings in American communities? \n\nOr - would you want to read data about these meetings through a blog or Substack? Something that shows how many housing projects are being approved, etc, etc. \n\nWould love any feedback, or thoughts on data you're interested in from local government meetings!",

But one conference that I will attend every time is Fortune Brainstorm Tech, which I had the pleasure of joining the past few days in Utah.\n\nWhat I love about Brainstorm: it’s well run, well moderated, and the speakers are off-the-charts excellent. It’s a rare conference where you actually have the opportunity to meet lifelong friends. This year was the first time I attended in 10 years, in part because I am very curious about where we are headed with AI. \n\nAnd the conference didn’t disappoint - we got a glimpse into not only the near future with AI, but the far future. We heard from the Founder of Runway about the future of Hollywood and Creative. We heard from the CEO of Wiz about the prospect of a Google Acquisition and his long term future vision for the company. We heard about how companies are actually using AI today and what they see in the near term future (from the CTO of Wipro, Adobe, and others). And we heard a lot about the fundraising environment and where investors believe value will accrue in AI long term.\n\nKudos to Andrew Nusca  and Maryam Banikarim 🗽🚕 ❤️  for putting on a perfect conference. Pictured - I met Clara Shih  when we were both Series A Founders 10 years ago, and we remained friends over that time. Here we are 10 years later - she is now the CEO of Salesforce AI. The activities interspersed throughout the conference were awesome - I was fortunate to take the pickle ball championship, which I consider my greatest career accomplishment to date :). \n\nIt was all capped off on day 2 with an awesome performance by musician/entrepreneur Aloe Blacc  \n\nNow I want to take these ideas and channel some of them into Hamlet. LMK if you’d find a write up of some of my takeaways valuable!",

In coming months I'll be sharing more about what we're up to, but it has been an interesting journey since we formed the company in November of '22. \n\nI thought we were building a media company. We were taking long and arduous City Council and Planning Commission meetings and summarizing them. We thought we would create a series of local newsletters for every small city in America, so residents could get better information about where they live.\n\nThen other customer types started reaching out and Hamlet became a B2B company.\n\nGovernments and Private companies use Hamlet data. Governments - such as Saratoga, CA and Palo Alto, CA work with us to summarize meetings on an ongoing basis, so they can share information with their residents. Private companies use us to extract key information and data from City Council and Planning Commission meetings. We will be doing a big product unveil around this in September. \n\nIf you are following local issues in small American communities, we can help. If you are a City Manager, we can help.  I'm excited for the journey ahead - this one has the 'feel' of being something potentially very big.",

So many great products are being released here, and the numbers are staggering - Klarna recently reported that their AI customer service tools are able to do the work of around 700 agents. \n\nThese aren’t ‘chatbots’ like you’re used to thinking about them. Customer service agents actually learn, get better and will take this entire market by storm.\n\nOne of the more interesting companies in the space is Decagon, started by Jesse Zhang. I had a chance to ask him a few questions on the heels of his fundraising announcement (he just raised $35M from Accel, A16Z and a host of others). Angels in the round include folks like Matt MacInnis, Aaron Levie and others. \n\nThis is a space to watch, and something you should be looking to implement soon….",

Palo Alto is going to be a great partner - we are glad they see that AI can be used for positive purposes in city government. \n\nAs for Hamlet, we now have about 10 customers, not of all of whom are government. We've found that we create value for a few different customer types, and the company is growing fast. We will be doing a big announcement in September about our products, and some other news since not all is evident from our website yet (intentionally). Proud of the work Mike Grafton, Maya Flores D'Orazio, Lindsey Norton, Alisha Aufai, Agustín Rodríguez, Javier Perez and Patricia Cobelli have helped with from the start. \n\nIf you're a city manager - we can help with transparency, community engagement, and we're building other products that will make life easier for you.

If authentic, the significance of this cannot be understated - it would be as if Coke had its formula revealed to the public for the first time. The piece of the leak that's missing is how each factor is weighted, but to me, these are the most important takeaways:\n\nWhitelisting:  Google has employed whitelists during major events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, elections) to control the visibility of certain websites in search results.\n\nE-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness): Although publicly emphasized, the leaked documents show minimal direct evidence of E-E-A-T influencing rankings.\n\nChrome Data Integration: Google's Chrome browser was created to gather full clickstream data, which significantly influences search rankings.\n\nNavBoost & Click Data Utilization: Contrary to Google's public denials, internal documents confirm the use of click data (long vs. short clicks) to improve search result quality, a system called NavBoost.\n\nIf you're building a new site, and you're a small business, it feels like the SEO arbitrage opportunity you think you have is more than likely no longer available. There's sure to be more extensive reporting on this in coming days, but if you're marketing anything right now, you should probably read up on this and have a discussion on how you allocate budget. It turns out the money you are spending on SEO/SEO firms may no longer be effective....",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 10mo ago": "PPC and SEO are dead. If your company relies on both as primary marketing channels, and you aren't already talking about what's next, you should probably get together today. \n\nIf you haven't been living under a rock, you are likely aware that:\n\n1. Google is widely rolling out AI Overviews to all search users, which deprecate organic search results.\n\n2. Open AI released a new model earlier this week, which makes multimodal search (i..e voice search) easy and fun (separate note, Apple should be embarrassed that Open AI effectively made Siri obselete in no time at all). \n\n3. Generally, users are gravitating more and more toward tools like Anthropic, GPT-4o, Perplexity and others for search. This trend is only going to accelrate.\n\nSo as a marketer, what should you do? Is all hope lost? Absolutely not, there are a million things you can and should be doing right now. An abbreviated list - all of which can be expanded into their own 500-word posts:\n\n1. Text is not the only channel that works. Focus on other forms of media for acquisition - people absolutely love streaming. Hulu and others are introducing new ad-unit types - is your brand transferrable to image/audio and other forms of media? If it isn't, make sure it is right away.\n\n2. Invest in Brand - but by that I don't mean hire agencies or an expensive Chief Brand Officer. It is now cheaper and easier than ever to use some of the existing AI tools to build iconic brands. More important - it is easier to 'be everywhere' thanks to AI. I have a million ideas on this, which I'll share in a future post. \n\n3. Influencer marketing will still work, but not the way you think - AI influencers are going to become a thing. How can you build 10 of your own AI influencers to advocate for your brand, constantly post, and go after audiences you care about? With technology today this is completely feasible. The not-scaleable way of doing this is to just pay existing influencers to post on your behalf. \n\n4. Similarly - this is going to sound off the wall - but AI generated newsletters and podcasts are going to be a thing. You can now output 1 podcast episode a day easily using tools like Eleven Labs. Email newsletters are even easier - you'll need an editor to avoid inaccuracies and hallucinations, but AI generated newsletters that add value to users are also going to be a thing. \n\nThe list goes on, and it's different for B2B than it is B2C, but don't be paralyzed. Start somewhere today - this trend is inevitable, and being in denial about it won't help. The best companies will adapt, as they always do.",

I am an unapologetic, pro technology Silicon Valley based Founder... but it's pretty indisputable at this point that under a certain age, phones are just not good. \n\nRather than the normal moral-panic fare around this debate, the author dives really deep and provides a more thoughtful analysis around the 'why'.

Later in the study, students were asked directly, “Would you prefer to live in a world without Instagram [or TikTok]?” A majority of students said yes––58 percent for each app.\n\nThis is the textbook definition of what social scientists call a collective-action problem. It’s what happens when a group would be better off if everyone in the group took a particular action, but each actor is deterred from acting, because unless the others do the same, the personal cost outweighs the benefit.\"\n\nI'm still left with the question - at what age is it appropriate to give a child a phone?",

It's the single most impressive piece of technology I've encountered since the iPhone - but I'm not buying one....\n\nFirst - anytime a technology like this comes out, you get a chorus of naysayers who regale at the fact that this could end up being the next Newton, Juicero, or other long line of hardware failures. The Vision Pro is an achievement of American engineering - not a failure just by virtue of the fact it was released. \n\nI am confident that we will all be using this product by the time V3 or 4 come out. When the iPad first came out, it was widely panned - over half a billion iPads have now sold. Then - people made fun of the watch - which now sells over 50 million units a year. \n\nI've also tried other VR headsets - like the Oculus. And watched Zuckerberg's response video - the Oculus is not as good a product as the Vision Pro is. It's not even close, but that's a separate post for another time.\n\nThe screen is just flat out impressive - I promise you you've never experienced a screen like this in your life. The eye tracking - you can literally direct it which apps to open with your eyes - feels seamless. The way spatial video looks inside the headset is also unlike anything you've experienced with another tech product. \n\nOn the downside - you can definitely tell you are in a VR headset - the background/camera passthrough effect is noticeable. And you can feel the weight of it after 30 minutes or so.\n\nSo why won't I buy one? Aside from the obvious - price - is that frankly I'd feel weird wearing one around the house with wife, kids and dog staring at me wondering what I'm doing. It's an isolating experience. And after that 30 minute session - you do feel like you've been on another planet, and it takes you a while to reorient.\n\nOnce Apple nails the form factor, and figures out how to blend the 'real world' experience a bit more with the in-headset experience, then it's absolutely going to be the next great computing platform. \n\nAnyone who is interested in technology should at least do the tour to experience it - and the critics should take a look at it before flat-out dismissing it as pure hype.",

I believe the fundamental premise of this thought process is flawed - it implies we somehow need to make it cheaper to cover interesting information - when we likely need to be doing the opposite. \n\nSome interesting stats (source - SEM Rush):\n\nPictured - Buzzfeed's organic traffic at peak was 62M monthly uniques, it's now 1/6th that size.\nAlso pictured - Vice - which hit over 40M monthly organic visits, but is now 1/10th that size.\n\nAll the AI-enabled content in the world is not going to reverse that trend. Audiences are just not interested in what news outlets are offering - and it's become easier for any news outlet to generate commoditized content like sports scores, recaps of TV shows, or expand their Op-Ed section to incite flame wars and potentially produce a viral hit. \n\nWhat we need is for media organizations to decide where they are operating. Are you a high quality journalism outlet with high quality, well-researched content? Or are you selling citizen journalism? There is no room left in the middle anymore. \n\nThe Information is one of the best here - they picked an identity, and they are nailing it. Stratechery. The Verge (which produces the best device reviews to this day). On the 'low end' of the cost production scale, we need more individual contributors at the local level who can assume the role the newspaper used to play. Every small city will have 1-2 people who assume the mantle of taking on local content, and they can make good money in the process. \n\nWe don't need AI-generated content that's gamifying search, and further eroding Google's already declining search experience. \n\nWe need people who want to do the work.",

My second piece covers how to use AI for data analysis. You're probably used to be that person at work who is the spreadsheet, or SQL person (I used to be that person early early career). AI can give that person a lot more leverage, without expending a huge amount of effort or $$. \n\nIf you want your team to start using AI today, this is a really good place to explore.

Example - if you join the Planning Commission, you are responsible for reviewing land use applications to make sure they adhere to city regulations. \n\nAll you have to do to get involved:\n\n1) Go to your local government's website\n2) Follow the statement of interest/application instructions\n3) Go through the interview process - let the chips fall where they may\n\nA lot of people have a fear of getting involved in public life, yet they want government to change. During this important year for the country, I'd really encourage you to join. \n\nI shared an example of a committee application page from a nearby city - Moraga - in the picture below.\n\nSince I started Hamlet to help small communities, and support local governments, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and submitting an application for a commission in my city.

So what exactly does that mean? \n\nHamlet uses public data and information to create a ‘landing page’ for cities. We then also use public data to create newsletters for each of these cities - focusing specifically on smaller cities in America where there may be no local newspaper (however, we aren’t a news organization). \n\nResidents discover the newsletters through a variety of mechanisms - search, social, etc and subscribe. Simultaneously, while we are building distribution in these cities, we are speaking to City Managers from all over America about summarizing critical information - like city council meetings - so they can direct their residents to a credible source of information outside of social media. \n\nThe foundational work that has gone into the past year is building a product that can scale to every city and special district in America, and create meaningful, valuable content for these cities. \n\nOur next phase, which is happening in parallel, is working with governments to create ‘hubs’ for the content they want to share with residents. We already have 3 paying customers at this point, and we’re talking to many, many more. \n\nAnd in search, for some cities we are already a first-page results, in some cases outranking sites like Compass, Redfin, and even the government website in rare cases. We have hundreds of subscribers in some cities. \n\nHamlet wants to turn public data into usable information so residents know how to ‘use’ their city. And for governments, we will save administrative time, and unnecessary headaches along the way. America should be easy to use. \n\nThanks to Leslie Bartley, Javier Perez, Alisha Aufai, Agustín Rodríguez and the rest of the team for the release of these new states and cities.

I've been actively investing in companies for a number of years - I've never been more impressed with the expertise and depth of thought founders are bringing to the table now. \n\nLiterally everyone is working on AI to solve different problems vertical-by-vertical.\n\nIn the past 2 months, I've seen about 10 companies working on tackling sales automation through AI, and many of them seem to have traction. Whether its sales training, SDR outreach, script generation.... across the board this is the area where I'm seeing the most activity (also seeing a lot in marketing right now). \n\nAnother hot area is mental health, where I've seen a number of companies pitch potential AI solutions for mental health ailments. My personal view is that this space is years away from being viable. \n\nIn a bizarre, perhaps more dystopian area - I have seen 2-3 companies working on helping people automate their responses using AI on dating apps. This is going to have some pretty interesting societal ramifications, but AI is being used to navigate social awkwardness, whether we like it or not. \n\nI'm excited to be working on Hamlet, but at nights and on weekends I'm still actively investing here or there (in about one company a quarter).

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "I just spent a few days in Washington DC at Bloomberg City Lab - a conference which brings together mayors and city leaders from all over the world to talk about technology, innovation, and urgent issues affecting cities at the present moment. Between this conference, League of California Cities, and ICMA, I've talked to dozens of city officials over the past few weeks and the conclusion I've come to is - the most existential issue America faces right now is the housing crisis. \n\nBut the housing crisis isn't just about affordable housing (which we need more of). As is the case with all of these things, it's much more nuanced - I wanted to share some of what I heard while it's fresh in my head:\n\nFor some cities, it takes ten years from the time a new development is approved to the time it actually hits the market. That is unacceptably long. And contrary to what you might think, it's not just CA cities that are burdened by this - it's true all over the country.\n\nOne of the keys to solving homelessness - according to many cities - is to make sure someone who is on the streets is re-housed ASAP. And then provided with services to get them back on their feet. The longer the time someone spends on the streets, the more likely they are going to be there for a long time. This obviously intuitively makes sense, but we're unable to -- across America - solve this. Some cities want to use vacant high rises and hotels to help, but are facing administrative hoops and opposition. \n\nNew developments are happening.... but mostly in 'richer' areas where fancy retail can be built. Cities are using tools like density bonuses to incentivize the creation of affordable housing, but it's just not working. In CA the Housing Element has been widely panned by cities as the incorrect tool to get cities to build affordable housing. There has to be another way. \n\nLast - climate change is happening and cities are experiencing warmer temps. But existing buildings are not built for the 'new' climate. An example of this is the Pacific Northwest - which has traditionally been a safe-haven for extreme climate. In 2021 a heat 'dome' hit the region and many died as a result. This is because PNW homes don't have things like A/C, and cities don't have 'cool' places for residents to get rest from extreme heat. \n\nNext to housing, crime is the second issue cities are concerned about. But that's another post in and of itself, and inter-related to housing. \n\nGrateful to have had the opportunity to meet so many people over the past few weeks - here I am with Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. (who is an awesome leader). Special thanks to Thomas Goetz. \n\nNow I need a nap.",

I cannot emphasize what an important role City Managers play in a functioning democracy - Mayors and Councils get the publicity, but City Managers execute on the vision. \n\nWhere you live, right now, here are an abbreviated list of responsibilities the City Manager takes on:\n\nOverseeing day-to-day municipal operations and implementing policies set by the city council\n\nPreparing and submitting the annual city budget for council approval\n\nHiring, supervising, and terminating city department heads and employees\n\nAdvising the mayor and city council on financial conditions, programs and needs of the city\n\nEnsuring delivery of city services to residents\n\nNegotiating contracts, permits, and agreements on behalf of the city\n\nRepresenting the city in meetings with community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders\n\nAddressing residents' concerns and complaints about city services\n\nCoordinating the city's emergency response in events of natural disasters or crises\n\nOverseeing infrastructure projects like road repairs, park upgrades, etc.\n\nPromoting economic development and growth in the city\n\nEnsuring the city follows all state and federal laws and regulations\n\nThe role of the City Manager is to make sure everything works - you only become aware of who they are if something is going wrong. But most of the time, no news is good news, and they keep everything running well. \n\nThe talk went well. Our aim at Hamlet is to make communication about the issues city managers take on much smoother - via council summaries, planning commission summaries, and other products (many of which we have in pipeline this coming year). \n\nThis will save City Managers administrative time - with people not pinging them about questions that are easily-answerable through these summaries. And it's good for residents - who won't have to rely on social media or urban legend to figure out what's going on in their city. \n\nIf you don't know who your City Manager is, you should find them and thank them!",

No phones until they are 30.... Ok, may not be able to pull that off, but in all seriousness knowing what I know about tech and how addictive it is for me personally - it feels like a bad idea to foist Tik Tok, Instagram and all the Internet has to offer to an emotionally developing adolescent. For context, we haven't introduced Minecraft or Roblox yet to them. All of the studies we read on social media indicate it's just not good for kids, period. \n\nAm I being naive here? I'm obviously not anti-technology - I had IRC as a kid in the 90s, and was introduced to the Internet at a young age (which I give a lot of credit to my parents for doing). The only differences are there weren't billions of users, mobile, social media and there are now many more nefarious actors with sophisticated techniques to scam kids.\n\nThe argument I hear against this position is that kids will feel left out because all of their friends organize gatherings, share location, and communicate using Snap, Discord, and other platforms. \n\nWould love some thoughts here.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "Well - the cat is out of the bag - we just announced our first customer at Hamlet: the City of Saratoga, CA.\n\nWhen I started Hamlet, the primary motivation was concern around how people receive information at the local level in small American cities - it's usually through word of mouth or social media. While I was a City Council candidate last year, it became apparent to me that there are a few people within small communities that emerge and typically control the entire narrative. I think this ends up being net bad for most American communities.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, people who do want to get involved with local government generally don't have time to attend 3-hour long city council meetings - especially after long days at work. But they do care.\n\nThe answer is to make government easier to understand for citizens - which is what Hamlet is doing. This is beneficial for the government - who no longer has to direct citizens to social media for information. And beneficial for the citizens - who want to know what's important and engage where they are needed.\n\nThe City of Saratoga is the first to share this vision, but we are talking to dozens of other governments about deploying Hamlet's 'Gov Center' product as an information hub for residents. But we will have much, much more to announce on the product side soon....\n\nDoes your small city (fewer than 100,000 residents) need easier-to-understand information? Please comment and I'd love to connect with your local government. And if you have feedback on the product, please share! We are always looking to improve. \n\nLast, if your'e a City Manager, I'll literally talk any time of day you're available - I'm a light sleeper, which is a great attribute for entrepreneurship (though not always beneficial for life in general).  \n\nThx to Leslie Bartley, Maya Flores, Alisha Aufai, Javier Perez, Rob Tyrrell and the rest of the team for doing great work to get our first customer live.",

This is something I think we did really well at Scripted - we at one time had an active community of 80k writers and would regularly host writer events, and create other ways for the writer community to talk to each other. \n\nOf course a lot has changed since the days we were building community at Scripted. Two questions for anyone who might see this:\n\n1. What is the best and most effective way you've seen a company build community? \n\n2. Who is the best community manager you know? I'd love to speak to them for 30 minutes and get their take on latest tools/best practices. Please tag them in the comments if you're willing/able.\n\nGrateful as always for the help.

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "I had the great privilege of attending the League of California Cities conference this past week in Sacramento - where Mayors and City Managers of hundreds of CA cities gather to discuss issues affecting their communities. I am trying to learn as much as I can about small cities so we can build amazing products at Hamlet.\n\nThe most powerful - and most disturbing panel I attended was around an increase in hate speech in small communities in CA. Mayors and City Managers of several communities close to where I live (in the East Bay), expressed alarm around a growing number of disturbing incidents. I wanted to share - both to hear whether others are experiencing the same in their community - but more important - to hear any thoughts on how we can fix it. \n\nHere are some of the notes I took:\n\nRacist incidents in schools are increasing. \n\nCity Council meetings are being ‘zoom bombed’ in an organized fashion. During public comment, agitators appear to be using their open mic to express hate toward particular races or ethnic groups. \n\nBut what’s particularly insidious about it is after one commenter comments, several others follow suit with similar messaging - illustrating to city leaders a new level of coordination that they haven’t experienced before.\n\nIt’s not as easy as ‘cutting off’ commenters for a variety of reasons I won’t get into on this post.\n\nThe incidents are now transitioning to the real world. After one city experienced the aforementioned, groups were on the ground ready to distribute fliers expressing hate toward certain ethnic groups (for context, I received one of these fliers on my car when I was parked in another city).\n\nI think my main takeaway and concern is this - trolls used to hide behind the anonymity the Internet afforded them to be provocative and say awful things. They are now much more organized, well-funded, and don’t appear to care as much about social consequences of their actions.\n\nImmediately after the panelists spoke, at least 5 cities highlighted specific incidents that sounded eerily similar. \n\nAre you experiencing anything similar in your city? I want to share as much information as I can across city leaders I speak to to see if we can’t find a solution for this.\n\nThanks to  fellow CMC grad Ryder Todd Smith for encouraging me to attend this conference.",

We are approaching 100 subscribers for our newsletter in that small community, which is roughly 2% of the population. About 15 people showed up to the event. \n\nA lot of interesting takeaways that I thought could be broadly interesting for anyone who lives in an American suburb:\n\nEveryone there was concerned about how divisive local politics is becoming - small issues have gotten significantly more contentious over the past decade\n\nMost residents view their relationship with local government as adversarial. They feel there isn’t common ground on interests, and expressed a general mistrust of how local gov handles issues. This is the main problem we are working on at Hamlet.  \n\nSocial media mistrust is at an all time high - one of the first things people asked us about Hamlet is whether we’re planning on selling our data to FB or nefarious data brokers. Any new tech company that’s building for local faces this challenge - residents are jaded.\n\nDespite the problems - no one - and I mean absolutely NO ONE wants to run for local office. There were many reasons expressed for this, but this leads me to a question for you all….\n\nI’m curious - what would have to be true for you to consider running for city council or another local office? Would you ever consider it?",

TiredBanker takes the earnings reports of every S&P 500 company and summarizes them using AI - so you don't have to read through hours of boring transcripts, or listen to them on your commute home (when you could instead be chillin'). \n\nOver the weekend, we decided to put together a complete 'basics of investing' resource guide for any and all to peruse. In there, we cover basic topics like: \n\nWhat is a 529a plan? \nWhat is a Hedge Fund?\nWhat is trading on Margin? \nWhy did the gold standard cease to exist? \n\nWe want to use TiredBanker as a vehicle to educate the masses on some of these basic finance concepts that may seem difficult to understand at first. But just haven't been explained in an easy way to normal folks who don't invest for a living (which is in essence what we are doing with local government and Hamlet). \n\nWe'd love your feedback! Are there any topics we should add to the list beyond the 100 or so we created this weekend?

Our goal is still 1,000 cities live by end of year and we're going to get there.\n\nAs a recap, Hamlet is taking public documents - like city council meetings and summarizing them using AI. Our goal is to fill an information gap that so many suburban residents have - most don't have the time to get involved with their local communities, but want to know what's going on. \n\nOnce we're dialed in on growing the number of cities we have, we are going to do a bunch of interesting stuff on the subscriber growth side (while trying to maintain our open rates at 70%). After that we have a few non-obvious surprises up our sleeve, which I can't share yet. Let's just say we want to revamp and refresh the entire 'local' experience. \n\nDo you want Hamlet in your city to take boring mundane documents and turn them into something interesting? Leave a comment! And of course would love your feedback on what we're building if you have time. \n\nSpecial thanks to our amazing Head of Product Leslie Bartley and our Head of Editorial Ops Alisha Aufai for getting us ready for scale. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gtPcDTqu",

Looks like the most ticketed state plates outside of CA is AZ - of course this could just correlate with population of out-of-state folks that live in San Francisco but interesting to see Indiana make an appearance in the top 15. \n\nHow will they get you? Street cleaning is the most common type of violation by *far*. Meters will get you next - but there are a surprising number of double parking violation tickets issued. \n\nSome poor person paid nearly 10,000 dollars in parking tickets - you can sort the data by plate number but I chose to redact the full license plate for this post.

I found a dataset on Kaggle that takes some Spotify data over time for all of her songs and shows some pretty interesting trends. Here is one chart I came up with that I thought was interesting:\n\nThis analysis explores the evolution of Taylor Swift's music over time, focusing on two key musical characteristics - danceability and energy.\n\nDanceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n\nEnergy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n\nYearly Fluctuation: The danceability and energy of Taylor Swift's songs have fluctuated year by year - she is one of the most versatile artists we have.\n\nDual Trends: While some years showed a rise in both danceability and energy, others indicated a diverging trend, she experiments with new music quite a lot. \n\nEnergy Drop in 2012: Despite the high danceability in 2012, it was also the year with one of the lowest average energy levels in her songs.\n\n2008 and 2010 Variance: In 2008 and 2010, Taylor's music saw lower danceability, but a higher energy level compared to other years.\n\nContinued Evolution: Up to the latest data in 2023, Taylor's music continues to evolve, demonstrating her versatility and ability to experiment with different musical styles and elements.\n\nThe amount of data available out there for interpretation on the Internet never ceases to amaze me.",

The answer was 100 percent consistent across the board: crime and safety was number 1, and economic development of downtown areas was number 2. \n\nOn crime and safety, it didn’t seem to matter what city size was, or where in the country it was located - mayors all feel like it’s getting worse and we are at a critical point to turn it around. It seems to have gotten worse during COVID in particular, and our local officials are working hard to solve it though there is no consensus on exactly *how* to solve it yet. \n\nOn the economic development side, many mayors are trying to figure out how to bring people back downtown. Specifically - during COVID - many moved out of downtown areas. There is a labor shortage obviously for many different types of roles, but the main challenge appears to be convincing qualified workers to move back to areas where they are needed. \n\nFrom a purely tech perspective, AI did not come up a great deal in a good or bad way. I proactively brought it up in the context of what I’m working on at Hamlet, and it seemed to resonate. But it seems like the main tech issue mayors are focused on is broadband access for citizens in every city. There is Federal funding allotted for this, and Mayors are trying to find a way to make sure they get their city’s fair share.\n\nMental health is a top 5 issue for every mayor. There is broad concern about the worsening mental health crisis in America and how to address it. \n\nIt’s a great reminder as tech entrepreneurs and employees that we often think about problems in the context of the coastal cities. The problems in most of America are vastly different, and it’s good to get out of the echo chamber. I am going to do follow up trips to Arkansas, Virginia and Ohio in coming months, which I’ll report back on.\n\nI went to high school in Cleveland and was grateful to spend a little time with Mayor Bibb (pictured) from Cleveland - he’s a dynamic young leader. I met other great leaders like him at the conference, which makes me optimistic about the future of America (despite our contentious national politics). \n\nThank you again to Kapor Capital for this amazing opportunity.",

I view it as the ultimate user research project - I’m trying to learn as much as I can about American cities and their pain points as we work on growing Hamlet. I know national politics is fatiguing, but there is a lot of great work that’s being done across the country at the local level that gets little attention. \n\nWhat are some non-obvious questions I can ask the mayors of US Cities over the next couple of days? \n\nI’ll write an extensive post on what I learn early next week.

They even call LinkedIn out specifically as a place they pull data from. \n\nThe OpenTable social graph must be wild.

We wanted to test the premise that AI generated content can rank for SEO organically because it adds value for users. \n\nIt's now ranking organically for 15 keywords, and has hundreds of subscribers.

We now have 2-3 additional use cases we plan on rolling out in coming weeks and months related to this, which I'll share more about soon.\n\nUltimately - as Google has stated - you HAVE to create content that's valuable to users in order to rank - you can't just spam the Internet like in the days of content farms.

It's a gap that's been glaringly evident, but not many solutions have been practical enough or far-reaching enough to address it. \n\nThrough both online and retail outlets in over 195 countries, Azteco offers vouchers for small amounts of bitcoin. The idea is simple - it enables people to send, save, and spend bitcoin - right from buying a cup of coffee to sending money to family or friends.\n\nJack Dorsey  is leading the round. I have admired Jack for his forward-thinking mindset and his passion for leveraging technology to improve lives. \n\nI’ll admit. I’ve never been super into cryptocurrency and have often times been a major skeptic. But I’ve known Paul Ferguson  for 10 years and he is focused on making this mission work. The original vision of crypto was not financial speculation - it was to help the unbanked get access to worldwide financial infrastructure. I think Azteco is going to be the company that helps Bitcoin reach its original vision.",

I noticed a couple of concerning things: \n\nWe consume way too much information on social media in suburbs. And it's usually the loudest voices that carry the conversations in small communities. \n\nLocal newspapers are dying at a record pace - we've lost approximately 1/3rd of American papers in the past 15 years (mostly in cities of 100k people or fewer)\n\nI started a tiny newsletter in Orinda after my run, and used it to summarize public data - with very limited editing. People seem to like it!\n\nSo now we are focused on doing the same thing across every small city in America - defined as having a population of fewer than 100,000 residents. It turns out, many of the issues we face in America across suburbs are quite similar. \n\nIn the next couple of weeks, we'll be launching in 33 California cities, with the stretch goal of expanding to a thousand cities by June. \n\nSample topics we may cover include: \n\nThe California housing element\nWhat trends are we actually seeing in the quality of education? \nWhat is the status of the drought?\nWhat measures are on the ballot this fall? \n\nIf you have experience in hyperlocal marketing, I'd love to speak to you. \n\nSeparately - if your'e a resident of Marin, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Orange, San Diego or Santa Clara county I will buy you a coffee for some of your time. \n\nThanks everyone.

I've gone from eating in a rush at my desk or at the airport to making home cooked, healthy meals for myself and my family. This shift has led me on a wonderful journey, discovering ways to diversify the foods we eat and maximize our fiber intake in hopes of creating a healthier, immune-boosting gut biome -- an absolute necessity with a six year old in the house. I've seen major improvements in my overall health with more energy, better skin and weight loss. Plus, I've leveled up my love of cooking, while finding joy in starting my own garden and joining our local CSA. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm a fan of fiber. \n\nSo when an opportunity came my way to be an advisor of Floura & Co. -- launched yesterday by the incredible entrepreneur Jeni Britton -- I was all in. Known for her ice cream empire, I've long been impressed by Jeni's commitment to quality and taste, as well as her impact on community and culture. Jeni started Floura to make it easy and delicious to close the fiber gap with real food that tastes great. Can you believe that most of us aren't even consuming half of the fiber we need each day?! \n\nFloura is the most concentrated diverse fiber bar on the market. And yes, it’s really good! As an added benefit, it uses ingredients like apple cores and fermented watermelon rinds to capture the healthy parts of food that otherwise go unused. Better for us and better for the planet! \n\nI love supporting founders on their journey and can't wait to see where Jeni and her team take Floura. Check out Floura and let me know what you think! My favorite flavor is Brambleberry Lavender.",

So much of what she took away from my speaking engagement at the University of Maryland in 2015 is still on point today. \n\nHowever, I guess I didn’t know Jeff P. would become such a significant fixture in my life. So I’d say that working through the “partnership what-ifs” with friends or family is worth it. Together, we’ve not only built a family, but also grew a business, advocated for change and continue to dream together. \n\nI can now say that there is something reassuring about having someone in your corner who you trust to help get you to the other side of just about anything – whether that’s a spouse, a parent or a friend.  \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eX7Wkn5H",

And then playing catch up, speaking at events, attending to board activities, hosting office hours and more. What did I learn during this time?\n\n-Taking time away is good for the mind and the soul – I came back refreshed and motivated in a very different way.\n-Many conversations and opportunities waited for my return (and I’m okay with missing those that didn’t).\n-When it comes to content, I don’t want to do content for content’s sake. I want to make it relevant and meaningful for you – and me.\n-The future is difficult to predict. Surveys and trends don’t always tell you everything you need to know.\n-Because of this, we need to be grounded in our own purpose and how we use our voice.\n\nWith this in mind, I’m going to be leaning into those aspects of leadership that have been quintessential to my success: shared experience, collaboration, community, education and optimism. I’ve always been a “couldn’t we just…” person and I’m going to be doubling down on this notion.\n\nSo look out for Office Hours where we’ll be bringing different voices to the conversation. Brands shout outs that offer a masterclass (or startup class) on building brands sustainably. And perhaps a favorite book or inspiring quote that gets us thinking about how we’re showing up in the world.",

As I mentioned to her, I'm proud to say that S'well started the movement by thinking differently about the role reusable bottles could play in our lives. What is happening now isn't a trend, but what I'd call a cycle -- a moment where reusables are re-emerging into the cultural dialogue. It's exciting and interesting to see how each cycle is different, which brand is on top and what is driving the conversation. As we move from this one to the next, I hope that the brands capitalizing on it can be intentional in standing for more, finding ways to not just talk about their bottom lines but the impact they are having on the planet and the people putting them on top.",

The progress is real. More girls are completing secondary school than ever before. Adolescent birth rates have fallen from 51 to 42 births per 1,000 adolescent girls since 2012. Child marriage rates are also falling, with South Asia seeing the biggest decline in the past decade – from 46% to 28%. \n \nWhile the lives of girls have undoubtedly improved in many respects, they still face unprecedented challenges. Nearly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are neither employed nor in education or training – compared to 1 in 10 boys. Hundreds of millions of girls worldwide are still subjected to child marriage and female genital mutilation – even though both have been internationally recognized as human rights violations. \n \nOn this International Women’s Day, UNICEF is also shining a light on nutrition. A new report from UNICEF, issued today, shows that more than one billion adolescent girls and women suffer from undernutrition. Undernourished and Overlooked: A Global Nutrition Crisis in Adolescent Girls and Women warns of the intensifying nutrition crisis, exacerbated by ongoing gender inequality. From the report, we also learn that that the number of pregnant and breastfeeding adolescent girls and women suffering from acute malnutrition has jumped 25% from 5.5 million to 6.9 million since 2020 in 12 countries hardest hit by the global food and nutrition crisis, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen.\n \nHere is a 90 second video that talks more about this crisis and how UNICEF is responding: One Billion Reasons for Better Nutrition.\n \nThe numbers show us that progress is possible. On this International Women’s Day and every day, UNICEF will continue fighting, investing and innovating until all girls have their rights protected and the opportunity to fulfill their fullest potential. THANK YOU to UNICEF for helping to build a more equitable future for girls and women everywhere.",

As I take a moment to reflect on reaching 10 and the many milestones we've achieved, I want to say thank you to everyone who has helped us get this far. \n\nAt a time when community seems so out of reach, the S'well network has shown up in unexpected ways -- more thoughtful conversations, more acts of kindness, more stories about S’well’s impact on their lives...I'm so proud of what we've accomplished and eager for S'well to continue to be a grounds’well of change and connectivity in the decade ahead. \n\nMy hope is that we’ll bring even more people together to influence the world in new, impactful ways and would love your help.

    "Sarah Kauss's post 5yr ago": "In 2015, I felt the need to write about knockoffs. My point of view was simple – stay true to your brand, uphold your mission, innovate often and know your customers’ needs at every turn. These were my hacks to stay one (or maybe three) steps ahead of the people and companies who believe they have the right to ride the coattails of another brand’s success.\n\nTimes have changed over the last four years though and so have my views. Now I know this approach is only one piece of the puzzle. As this piece from Medium’s Stephanie Clifford highlights, S’well has had to partner with legal teams, Custom Border Patrol, vendors and retailers to fight the fakes. And even when we win, we lose...because the system is broken. There are too many people stealing from original brands’ playbooks with the world of copycats having grown too big and consumers at large too dependent on quick delivery at the cheapest price – losing sight or simply not knowing what is real and what is fake anymore.\nForever the optimist, I believe that along with legal and government support, we need to create a cultural shift in behavior. And we need to do this in solidarity with eachother – big retailers coming together with entrepreneurs and consumers to find a way to collaborate and educate for change. Who’s with me?",

The question — how can I get people to trust a young company run by young people? — is one I get asked pretty often. Here's my response:\n\n“It can be trying going into a situation where you feel like you may already be at a deficit, but change that thinking. You're passionate about the service you’re providing and you believe in the expertise you're bringing to the table. Let this belief guide your process of reeling in new business. Feel out any concerns they may have by asking powerful questions. Their issues may have nothing to do with age and more about how you're positioning the company's successes. Focus your pitch and select the right successes (no matter how small) and make them sizzle. If they don't go with your company, ask them why so that you can refine your message. The young company, or age difference, might not be the issue at all. If you find out that it is, though, ask your current clients how they overcame that concern and home in on those winning features.”",

Seeing a packed room—filled with as many men as women—eager to learn, connect, and refine their approach to raising capital was truly inspiring. \n\nDuring the workshop, I shared insights into the fundraising journey, particularly for early-stage startups led by diverse founders. We covered strategies to “prepare for a raise”—focusing on clarity, creating urgency, and defining a compelling, market-focused value proposition. It’s crucial for founders to highlight not only their business strengths but also the unique value they bring as individuals. 🎯\n\nSome key takeaways we discussed:\n- Be prepared! Do the groundwork on mindset, market research, and process.\n- Show investors the path to profitability and the potential for an exit. You have to help them see the “big picture.”\n- Approach fundraising strategically, even raising when you don’t need the cash to bring in valuable partners who can accelerate your business.\n- Gather feedback with “soft pitches” before launching a full round to refine your pitch and pinpoint the right investor fit.\n- Balance feedback with confidence—take advice, but know when to push back.\n\nRemember, when you approach fundraising with clarity, conviction, and vision, you’re much more than just your startup’s founder. You’re the driver of a future unicorn. 🦄✨\n\nThank you, Cyberport Hong Kong, and all the fantastic attendees who brought their energy and curiosity! Excited to see the impact you’ll create. Let’s keep breaking barriers, challenging the norm, and supporting one another. 🚀💪\n\n#Fundraising #founders #FounderMindset #DiverseFounders #VentureCapital",

This month serves as a beautiful reminder of the resilience, strength, and unwavering determination of women throughout history. From the suffragettes who fought for women’s right to vote to the trailblazers who shattered glass ceilings in business, science, social movements and beyond, their legacies inspire us to push boundaries and challenge the status quo.\n\nIn a world that often tries to dim our light, let us shine brighter than ever before. Let us support and uplift one another, knowing that our collective strength knows no bounds. Let us embrace our uniqueness and diversity, recognizing that it is our differences that make us strong.\n\nBut the celebration of Women's History Month isn't just about looking back; it's about looking forward with hope and determination. It's about amplifying the voices of women from all walks of life and ensuring that every girl and woman knows their worth and potential.💪🚀\n\n🚀 Let us break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and build a future where every woman and girl can thrive. So here's to the women who have paved the way, the women who are making history today, and the women who will shape tomorrow. Together, we are unstoppable. \n\n#womeninbusiness #womenfounders #womeninbusiness  #venturecapital #womenshistorymonth #bridgethegap #empowerment #womenempoweringwomen #womeninhistory #womenwholead",

Founder and CEO, Jasmine Jones and Bravo personality Dr. Jackie Walters shared their personal stories of courage, mindset & strength.\n\nFor Dr. Jackie and Jasmine Jones, ensuring that other women do not have those experiences is most important, in addition to raising awareness around underrepresented communities when it comes to breast cancer, particularly Black women who are 40% more likely to die from the disease.\n“Creating awareness before it is needed is the goal.

Their goal was to expose the unequal treatment of ads by Meta. Unbound discovered that while their ads for products like the Ollie Wand Vibe were rejected by Meta, Thunderthrust's ads for similar products targeted at men were accepted. This highlights a clear double standard in the way these platforms handle ads for women-focused sexual products.\n\nAccording to Polly Rodriguez, the founder of Unbound, the issue lies in society's discomfort with women, femmes, and nonbinary individuals taking ownership of their own bodies and pleasure. It's not the products themselves that are offensive, but rather the notion of empowering women and marginalized genders.\n\nRead article here: https://lnkd.in/eyVE-j73\n\n#genderlens #SexualEmpowerment #wellness #womenshealth #startup #womenfounders",

The blog post was titled \"I'm a 26 y/o venture capitalist. Here's why and how\". People flooded to us saying that they would love to see this idea come true for their daughters or their younger selves, so we went for it.\n\nFast forward to today, our $15M Fund I's 42 companies have created $7.8B in enterprise value, with a few early unicorns and many companies that have made a positive impact on people, society and the planet.

Reading previous stories they’ve written or listening to podcast episodes that are already posted can tell you a few important things:\n\n1). How do they stylistically handle interviews? Do they give their guests plenty of time to answer or do they frequently interrupt?\n\n2). Are their questions very targeted or are they more open-ended?   Ironically, the less-specific questions often can be more challenging to answer.\n\n3). Is their tone easy going and hospitable or more intense and aggressive?\n\n4). Is there a topic of conversation that captures their imagination to the point where they find a way to work it into every interview?  For instance, perhaps they’re fascinated by AI, and they seem to always incorporate a question on that subject. You can rest assured they’ll do the same with you.\n\nDoing a little advance research to create your own scouting report on your interviewer can help eliminate unwelcome surprises.",

I wrote an authoritative and in-depth article based on a subject matter expert interview that perfectly matched search intent, and I performed rigorous on-page SEO optimization with Clearscope. After it was published, I added internal links from relevant articles that were published in the following months. That’s it. \n\nSo do you need to change your strategy? \n\nIt depends on whether you were already hip to the importance of high quality content that offers original insights. If you were still churning out “SEO content” that provided thin coverage of topics without any real expertise or authoritative opinions, then yes, you will need to change your strategy. \n\nBut if your current SEO strategy focuses on in-depth content that provides the best answer on the internet for your target search queries, then you don’t need to change your strategy at all. AI Overviews favor well-researched and cited articles that concisely satisfy the search intent. Thankfully, most human readers do too.",

    "Olivia Barrow's post 1yr ago": "Exactly seven years ago today, I quit my last corporate job and started Olivia Barrow Communications. Here are 7 Things I've Learned in 7 Years. \n\n1. Start before you’re ready. You’ll never be fully ready, so just dive in. Everyone is always learning as they go. That’s the fun of it. \n\n2. New clients can come from anywhere. I’ve gotten connected to amazing, long-term clients from my running community, my coworking space (shoutout to 100state for connecting me to current clients Curate and vChief), my former employer, interview subjects, and complete strangers who found my LinkedIn, just to name a few. \n\n3. Referrals can take years. But when they come through, they can turn into amazing opportunities. \n\n4. Pricing never gets easier. I have to battle my inner demons daily to believe I’m worth what I charge. \n\n5. There will always be a new piece of technology to learn. And it will always make me uncomfortable, until suddenly it’s second nature.\n\n6. When self-care comes first, everything else falls into place. Everything else will sort itself out if I take care of myself, whether that’s maintaining my mental health by exercising, taking the time to prepare healthy lunches, or giving my body the rest it needs by taking an unplanned sick day. \n\n7. Whenever I give back, I get more. Every time I donate my time, talent, or treasure and extend myself just a little more than feels comfortable, the universe shows up with amazing gifts far beyond the risk I took. \n\nHere are two fun photos from that fateful summer. The first is a picture of a TV appearance I have only the vaguest memory of (I was a newspaper reporter, so being on TV was an occasional job hazard) showing my long hair and makeup days. It took me 4 years and a global pandemic to start working on that novel, but I'm 196 pages in now, thanks to Madison Writers' Studio. The second is the first check I cashed as a business owner, for $300 on Aug. 17. \n\nIt's been an amazing ride.",

    "Olivia Barrow's post 6yr ago": "I've now been freelancing for two years. (To all who notified me it was my anniversary, thanks for the kind words!)\n\nIt seems fitting that I spent that work anniversary pushing the limits of the #digitalnomad life. Today, my girlfriend started a six-week externship in Boise. She had two weeks off before it started, so we had planned a National Parks road trip. \n\nOnly problem? I got slammed with work at the beginning of July. \n\nIf you look at my Instagram, you'd think I was in pure vacation mode for the last two weeks. But the truth is we spent many nights in Visitor Center parking lots writing assignments because that's the only spot of LTE in the national park. One afternoon, we drove to the top of a mountain so I could get a clear signal to finish an assignment. I took two phone calls from a picnic table in the Badlands while Nicole chased prairie dogs with her camera. I answered urgent emails while hanging off a cliff in my climbing harness in the Black Hills. \n\nMaybe this all sounds really great. Maybe it sounds incredibly stressful. It was both. I'm glad we were able to experience the hikes, climbs, and sights of the West, but I'm also so glad to be back in civilization with a regular schedule. \n\nBring on the grind! And if you have Boise recommendations, please share!",

They just care about whether you can solve their problems. Later on, when your success has bred copycat competitors, you might need that \"why\" to help distinguish yourself.\n\nAnd if you make it to that point, your customers might end up showing you a \"why\" that you would never have imagined. Airbnb just figured out their why 11 years in. In a recent blogpost, the founders noted: \n\n“What started as a way for a few friends to pay the rent has now transformed into something bigger and more meaningful than we ever imagined...People thought Airbnb was about renting houses. But really, we’re about home...What makes this global community so special is that for the very first time, you can belong anywhere. That is the idea at the core of our company: belonging.”\n\nYour \"why\" may or may not come to you easily. If it does, it might transform the way you think about your business. But if you have to spend 6 months or a year turning your brain upside down looking for it, it will leave you with less clarity than when you started.",

Thinking big means defining your processes, and finding your product-market fit, and figuring out how to scale, and imagining how a $50,000 loan could take you to the next level.\n\nThis article by Elad Gil does a great job explaining the danger of thinking big when you haven’t bothered to think small: https://lnkd.in/d5KQN_w\n\nGil says, “Too many entrepreneurs start with a grand premise that is impossible to execute from day one, and distracts from building a useful product.” \n\nTo me, that’s what a “why” can end up being for freelancers. A grand idea that provides no guidance on how to get from the disorganized mess you are today to the systematic business poised for growth that you want to be in six months.",

(I'd be a terrible life coach.) \n\nSam Parr recently shared that in the early days of his tech-focused newsletter The Hustle, his biggest frustration was defining the mission.\n\n\"I thought that to recruit employees, investors, customers, and supporters you need some grand mission statement or operating values. So we were trying to come up with something special.

Clearly, they're doing something right, but I guarantee you, Steve Jobs did not start out in 1976 drawing a golden circle with why at the center and saying \"let's challenge the status quo oh and by the way let's make computers.\" \n\nHe saw an opportunity that matched his skill set and he explored it. That obsession with defying \"normal\" evolved as they got to know their customers and their own abilities.\n\n\"Start with why\" is great advice for established corporations with a solid product, processes that make that product exceptional, and an established customer base. If you need to diversify your business, then defining your why can help guide you into new products or services that your customers will trust you to offer.\n\nBut if you have no customers, then why does it matter what anyone associates you with? Startups pivot all the time. Spending time figuring out a why that will be flexible enough to handle your early pivots is a waste of time when you should be focusing on finding a product-market fit, defining your target audience, and articulating your value proposition.",

So I was determined to figure out my \"why\" and start building my business around it. \n\nAs I toiled through draft after draft of fluffy, vaguely inspirational, yet ultimately meaningless “why” statements, I met other freelancers who were in the same boat. I chatted with Dave Neelsen about how many of our clients are convinced they need to tell their customers about their \"why\" in their marketing materials.\n\nI also met some freelancers, like Sophie Livingston, who found a lot of value in the process.\n\nMy last series on InternLessons was fun, so I’m going to launch into another one: #DontStartWithWhy. I’ll explore 5 reasons why I think \"why?\" is the last question you should ask when starting a new business, but then share why I think it’s still a valuable question to ask — just not first. \n\nI’ll post the first reason tomorrow, but in the meantime I'm curious, have you struggled with this concept for yourself?",

Whoops. \n\nI’m morally opposed to unpaid internships. I think you get what you pay for, and no one should have to work for free. \n\nHowever, even though my entire payroll was going to be $3,000, I had to open a worker’s compensation policy, pay for unemployment insurance, and pay for payroll software to compute and file all of the social security and medicaid taxes for me while also handling the direct deposit of paychecks. Also, I will need some help with taxes next year, so that's another expense.\n\nI used Patriot Software and had a good experience with them, but the hassle and additional expenses will make me seriously pause before bringing on another employee in the future. It seems like contracting out work is a better option, both for saving time and money and also for enhanced productivity. \n\nI think I would only hire interns again if I get the opportunity to work on a long-term project that will be very labor-intensive, but has specific goals and success metrics to prove how it will help my business.\n\nThanks for tuning into this series and sharing your experiences and perspectives!",

My interns wrote the first draft, and then I revised the posts. Often, their first drafts were excellent, and when they needed improvement, I was able to quickly come up with a better option — much faster than if I was working on the original draft.\n\nWhen we were working on one-source stories, whether a personal profile of a member of our coworking space or a blog post for a long-term client, they were more than capable of creating the first draft. Sometimes I took over the draft from them, and other times I edited through comments and suggestions and let them continue to polish from there.\n\nBut where I struggled to delegate was with new clients. It was usually new work that I hadn't established a process for, and I wanted to have full control over the first impression. Part of the problem is that at this point in my career, I am still establishing processes and still working to define what my core services are. \n\nSo next time, I'll make sure those processes are locked down before hiring interns.",

I had only worked as an editor once, for a semester in college at the student newspaper. \n\nBeing an editor forced me to look at the pieces we were creating from an outsider’s perspective. It reinforced the need for a writing process (i.e., first, organize the information from the interview, second, create a garbage draft, third, write the headline, fourth, rewrite the draft, fifth polish everything). \n\nWhen you’re a good writer, it’s still easy to get lazy and stop pursuing excellence with every piece you produce. Being an editor gave me the ability to say, “we can write this more clearly” or “this point isn’t fully developed, do you have a better example?” And since someone else was going to do the work, I was willing to be a more honest editor. \n\nIt’s tough to provide that kind of editing for your own writing because no one wants to make more work for themselves.

Violet, who had never used Medium.com before, became an expert in optimizing the format and design of posts on Medium. Haley figured out how to set up Stripe on my www.GigniteIncubator.com website. They found many other incredibly helpful articles about content marketing best practices that I hadn't thought to search for and that saved me from reinventing the wheel. \n\nInstead of backing down from work that I don’t feel 100% confident in, I want to challenge myself to keep learning new skills.

Since I typically spend most of the hours of 9-to-5 at my coworking space, I didn’t think this would be a problem. But as soon as I had a reason to stick to an actual schedule, I realized how frequently I flex my hours, or work from home, or take coffee meetings at odd times. \n\nHaving to show up at 9:30 a.m. every Monday — I know, not even that early — was a shock compared to the previous 18 months of complete schedule freedom.\n\nWhen the internship was over, I was relieved to be the master of my schedule again.\n\nAbout halfway through, we found a rhythm with longer projects, and I knew I could depend on the interns to work independently if I needed to take a meeting during their hours.  \n\nThe biggest lesson was realizing how much I value that schedule flexibility.

The fact is that we do have technologies that can solve many of humanity's problems and that we choose not to use them is an ethical and moral issue that will be soon be considered repugnant. In the same way slavery became morally indefensible and was banned, so will poverty. We have the technologies to provide everyone with safe places to live, to go to school, to eat safe food, drink safe water and be safe from violence. Why would we choose not to?! Capitalism will change to profit from abundance instead of scarcity.  \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eACvUSE",

Although we have so much to be grateful for, it's hard not to consider the political climate, the growing economic disparities, and our declining mental health (a cause most of you know is so close to my heart).\n\nOur original card game, LikeU Cards, found quick success in Target, in Khols, and most recently in Barnes and Noble (YAY!), but we've decided to pivot to focus on reaching the most vulnerable and at-risk populations - kids. We've created a prototype version of our game specifically designed for schools, but we need your help to manufacture and warehouse the game.\n\nThis isn't about making money for me. This is a passion project. With a son who will be starting school in just a few years, I have SO much anxiety about bullying, and peer pressure, and comparison culture. I want to help create environments where kids feel physically and emotionally safe no matter what they believe or what they look like. Any donation you can make is helpful! With Love,\n\n- Kiara"

His innovation reduced the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThe new system was much more efficient. Under the old system, even if EVERY worker was productive, building a car took 12 hours. Why did the new system drastically improve productivity? Because systems affect outcomes.\nAre there police officers who are good people, with good intentions? Of course! But this does not change the fact that the SYSTEM is broken. If racist, prejudiced cops are being given a license to kill, and black people are being murdered at astronomically disproportionate rates, the system is broken. If laws and sentencing are applied to benefit some racial groups and not others, the system is broken.\n\nHave you ever wondered why being caught for underage drinking or doing drugs at a white college party has little to no consequences, but there are black men who have been in prison for years for possession of marijuana (even though white America has now turned marijuana into a big business)? Once a crime is no longer associated with blackness, it is deemed more socially acceptable. \n\n#SystematicRacismExplained"

The company announced today it's launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. It's very much giving where there is will — and tech — there's a way. However, we need not despair, as the human touch still as value in a world crying out for authenticity and creativity.

But there's still a lesson here for those watching their career industries slowly but irrevocably change around them. What lesson you take from it, however, is up to you.\n\nWriter Joel Stein said first, the free food changes, check. \n\nFor me, it was watching the lavish holiday offerings on the break room table diminish year after year when I worked in publishing. From huge Harry & David gift boxes filled with different varieties of apple — that's where I tried Pink Lady for the first time — to nothing. It was a wrench.\n\nThen the real estate changes. Yup. If you hear whispers of the building playing hardball when it comes time to renew the lease, you know why. For me, when you move from Michigan Avenue with floor to ceiling windows and a view of the lake down the block to the Illinois Center and a view of the street it's not terrible, but it is notable.\n\nChange happens quick. You have to remain vigilant, but I agree with Stein's assertion that we blame technology wrongly. #AI is not exactly the problem. It's that the human contribution no longer has significant value, and it should. \n\n#influencermarketing #KellyeMedia #contentmarketing #branding",

And thought provoking.\n\nPart of me wonders if the company knew it would be disturbing — and memorable and shocking and newsworthy — and just let it ride in the creative corporate version of \"let the chips fall where they may.\" \n\nTheir equally minimalist apology — “We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.” — seems — to me — to suggest a certain laissez-faire disregard for the emotional havoc they may have left in some viewers.\n\nAs for the problematic message the video contained, that: We live in a world where technology can, ostensibly, replace all of these tangible, significant things in one thin tech tool. Yeah. Dodgy. Maybe even super dodgy considering we're living in a time when tech (AI) is eating industries and jobs like Pac-Man on steroids.\n\nBut let's be fair, it did work.

Instead, those of us in this space should continue to monitor developments, but look beyond the bells and whistles. Consider what to do now and long term. For now, continue to be useful. For instance, your content strategy should focus on not just how to get people to your site but how to keep them there: What haven't you written about but should?

Private companies that supplied communications services had begun wining and dining prison officials, sheriffs, and other carceral system decision makers, going so far as to take them out on luxury yachts. These companies also began sharing their revenue with the prisons, thereby creating perverse incentive to raise phone rates.

Instead, it was largely used to subsidize the tuition of kids who were already in private school before the funding was introduced. This miscalculation blew a huge hole in Arizona's state budget, which means it had to take a hatchet to other important government programs.",

Typically, the slush pile has been regarded as a no-man's land that's treated with disdain by everyone who actually works in publishing. This piece pretty much confirms that.\n\nTo me, the problem of the slush pile basically boils down to sheer volume: there are certainly good books buried in them, but agents just don't think it's worth investing the time and resources into digging through all the bad stuff just so they can unearth these gems.\n\nThis is why so many authors just get fed up and go the self-publishing route; why go through the years of finding an agent and then shopping a manuscript around to a publisher when you can just bet on yourself and bring the book directly to market? If the book takes off, then you at least have some solid sales figures you use to bypass the slush pile on your next book.",

After all, a single AI spammer can literally churn out thousands of videos per day, and it doesn't matter if 99% of them reach absolutely no one; if even 1% of their videos go viral, then they'll clog our internet feeds and make human-created content that much harder to access.  \n\nThe silver lining right now is that AI slop is mostly successful on shortform video -- which is governed by sensitive algorithms -- meaning that if you specialize in other types of content -- newsletters, longform videos, podcasts -- you're probably at least somewhat protected.

Without rigorous fact checking, these bots are going to insert errors into copy. And if you have to hire someone to fact check every statement, then what efficiency is the chatbot driving?

Many of the media leaders I've spoken to aim to generate at least half of their revenue from low-cost memberships.",

That way, she can stay focused on her core competency -- tech reporting -- while leveraging her contacts and media expertise to identify promising and upcoming niche players.\n\nA lot of media entrepreneurs take the opposite approach by trying to copy-and-paste their media format for more and more niches. And sometimes that works! It certainly did for companies like Industry Dive and Aging Media. But that requires a special kind of media operator who isn't too invested in any one niche, whereas the success of The Information is rooted in Lessin's deep love and obsession with tech reporting.",

Basically, the idea is that you can promote an upcoming season of a show by releasing the previous season on free, ad-supported platforms. Basically, by that point you've wrung out all the subscription revenue you could from the previous season, and by releasing a free version you're not only driving additional revenue through ads, but also generating more demand for the new season, which sits behind the paywall. There's really no downside.\n\nIn fact, I'd love to see an even more radical version of this strategy: Imagine Netflix launching a free tier of its service that just offers the first season of all its TV shows. It would vastly expand its ad inventory while creating an even better subscription funnel for its paid tiers.",

Businesses usually hold their cards close to the chest, so there's a real information vacuum when it comes to the gritty details of what it takes to actually grow a startup. \n\nThere's also the argument that an audience becomes more emotionally invested in the success of the business if the owner is more open about their weaknesses and struggles.

Fox News generates an estimated $2 a month per subscriber. That means that it's lost somewhere around $720 million a year due to cord cutters.\n\nA Fox Nation subscription costs $4.99 a month. So at 2.5 million subscribers, that's $150 million in annual revenue. That's a $570 million deficit. \n\nOne thing I've been harping on for years is that Fox News makes $24 a year on every cable subscriber regardless of whether they actually watch the channel, so the best way for liberals to punish Fox News is to simply cut the cable cord.

His videos rarely contain much character development, and his editing style is so frenetic that it feels like you're watching a trailer for a reality TV show rather than the show itself.\nThe only MrBeast video I've actually been able to watch from start to finish was one where he locked two people -- a man and a woman -- inside a room together for 100 days. The narrow scope of only focusing on two people allowed the viewer to get to know them, and so it was much easier to become emotionally invested in the outcome.\n\nSo yeah, MrBeast is a great media entrepreneur but a pretty mediocre storyteller.",

The average cable news segment, after all, is little more than a talking heads podcast.

The energy and enthusiasm of the 20 early career journalists of color participants was matched by the potent insights and enormous generosity of spirit from stellar speakers who spoke truth and light to the fellows.\n\n* Sending gratitude and thanks to the Remarkable Ms. Kelsey Russell, that magnetic young media influencer who taught us all about the opportunities that exist at the intersection of audience engagement, social media and journalism;\n\n* The ever inspiring Catalina Camia of Bloomberg Law, whose dedication to mentoring and supporting journalists helped create the Widening the Pipeline program; \n\n* 2024 Widening fellow Bianca Quilantan  of POLITICO who shared profound insights about personal career challenges and the invigorating mentorship she received from Catalina Camia;\n\n* And last but most definitely not least, the inimitable Torrance Latham  of the Miami Herald, an original #NPFWidening fellow whose dynamic vision is a literal fountain of motivation and peer support. \n\nI’ve already said it about a hundred times, so once more won’t hurt. My work with journalists in the National Press Foundation Widening the Pipeline program is the great privilege of this golden era of my life and career. Their journeys give me hope and inspiration to, as my mother Eloise used to say, “Keep on keepin’ on”!",

First up we discuss Comcast raising the idea of spinning off its cable TV networks to shareholders. A move like this has been speculated on for years, as the networks are buffeted by cord-cutting. Comcast also said Peacock gained 3 million subscribers in Q3, benefiting from the Paris Olympics. \n\nMeanwhile Alphabet said that YouTube’s revenue for the past 12 months hit $50 billion, a first for the company. As we discuss, it’s likely that subscription services, which include YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, Primetime Channels and Sunday Ticket, exceeded $15 billion. That would make YouTube one of the top 3 streaming subscription providers by size. \n\nListen to the podcast to learn more (21 minutes, 24 seconds)\n\n#InsideTheStream #Streaming #ConnectedTV YouTube Comcast #Peacock",

When engaging with a CTV ad, Aluma Insights new research found a whopping 70% of viewers do so via their MOBILE devices, vs. just 42% who use their CTV’s remote control. And when viewers were asked, Aluma found that 42% of respondents prefer to use their mobile device to engage with a shoppable TV ad, while 26% prefer using the CTV’s remote, and 24% have no preference.\n\nWhat does all this mean to marketers and content providers? That it’s essential to “swim downstream, not upstream” - advertisers should capitalize on viewers’ habits and preferences, integrating mobile engagement with elements like QR codes displayed in shoppable TV ads, rather than trying to force engagement behaviors that are not yet natural for many viewers. \n\nFor more, watch the 1 minute highlight video below and contact Douglas Montgomery or Michael Greeson about the full report including 37 high-value charts! https://bit.ly/alumavideo4\n\n(Want to know more about how VideoNuze created this video and something like it could help your company?

Per Aluma Insights new research, an average of 80% of 18-44 year-olds have engaged with shoppable ads in social video, but only an average of 32% of 45-year olds and older have have done so. Meanwhile, an average of 47% of 18-44 year-olds have engaged with shoppable ads in TV, but only an average of just 26% of 45-year olds and up have engaged with a shoppable ad in TV.\n\nWhat’s this mean?

Deep-pocketed Big Tech (Amazon, Google, Apple) are scooping up marquee sports rights in an effort to add value to their services businesses. Linear TV viewing is collapsing. Consumers' attention is fragmenting as myriad social media and other activities beckon for eyeballs. \n\nOn this week’s Inside the Stream podcast, Colin Dixon and I discuss how #ESPN  has found itself at the center of this storm, as the venerable network gets squeezed from all sides. We raise a pressing - yet until recently unimaginable - question newly reinstated #Disney CEO Bob Iger must address: long-term, is ESPN still a good business? And if it’s not, should Disney keep the network anyway, or seek to sell it off?\n\nCheck out the podcast here: https://lnkd.in/e3Fd8tri\n\nnScreenMedia #sports #CTV #streaming #podcast #cordcutting",

The interview was facilitated by Steve Swasey, the company’s late, great head of comms at the time.\n \nBefore starting the interview I distinctly remember being somewhat discombobulated from setting up the tripod, lighting and camcorder (remember those?). So after asking my first question and as Reed began answering, it hit me that I’d forgotten to push the camcorder’s “record” button. So we began again.\n \nAs longtime VideoNuze readers know, I haven’t always agreed with everything Reed and the Netflix team have done in the past 13 years. But IMHO there is no single person who deserves more credit than Reed for catalyzing the massive business model and technical innovations that have reshaped Hollywood, the broader TV industry and consumers’ experiences.\n \nWatch Part 1:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eXAbUmxQ\n \nWatch Part 2:\nhttps://lnkd.in/e37dGzwR\n \n(if the editing looks primitive to you, it’s because I did it myself)\n \nThe day of the interview Netflix’s valuation was approximately $6 billion. Now it is approximately $150 billion.\n \nRemember that this interview was recorded before:\n- “House of Cards” and tens of billions of dollars invested in original content\n- Launch of Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video Channels, TikTok, etc, etc.\n- 4K streaming \n- “Peak TV”\n- International SVOD expansion\n- Connected TV explosion\n- “FAST” channels\n- Qwikster\n- Etc.\n \nIt was also years before Netflix would provide all of us with its recording of “Springsteen on Broadway,” The Boss’s 2018 solo show at the Walter Kerr Theater in NYC that is 2 ½ hours of truth-telling, soul-revealing, mind-boggling, age-defying, awe-inspiring, ass-kicking poetry in motion, which I can never get enough of (shout out to Ted Sarandos, who no doubt greenlighted it).\n \nLast, the interview occurred 3 months after I wrote “It’s Official: Netflix Has Entered a Virtuous Cycle” in February, 2010  which I finished with:\n “For years I have been saying that broadband video is the single most disruptive influence on the traditional video distribution value chain. Netflix's success with streaming and the consequences that are yet to play out are resounding evidence of this. Above and beyond YouTube, Hulu, Amazon, Apple and others, Netflix is by far the most important video distributor to watch.”\n\n😁 \n\nRead it here if you'd like: \nhttps://lnkd.in/eg9aUupK \n\n#streaming #SVOD\n\nBelow is a 40 second clip from the interview of Reed discussing competitors he was most scared of at the time:",

As an artist and instructor in the Rutgers School of Social Work, Karen grounds her teaching in neuroscience, psychology, and creative approaches to empathy and healing. Her just-published book with co-author Edward K. S. Wang acknowledges the scale of loss and difficulty the COVID pandemic engendered within the field of education, yet this book focuses on how sudden and forced changes to teaching and learning created “Pandemic Positives,” which can be captured and brought to scale.\n\nThis book study consisting of three 90-minute sessions will correspond to the three parts of the book: Part I addresses how Pandemic Positives came into being, with special attention to the presence of educator hope and creativity. Part II explores the Pandemic Positives that arose in three settings: when schools were closed, when learning turned online, and when schools re-opened. Part III provides strategies for replicating the Pandemic Positives so they become positive educational game changers. While a very readable book told through educators’ experiences and insights, the book is grounded on trauma and mental wellness theory and scholarship, and discussion of strategies for proactive responsiveness will extend beyond the context of the pandemic. In the study sessions on Fridays, January 31, and February 14, 2025, from 11:30 am to 1:00 pm Eastern, campus teams of 2 or more people will reflect together with colleagues and each school will identify concrete ways to implement trauma-informed and crisis-prepared strategies.\n\nIn addition, the text features art created by the coauthors. The first five teams that register in January will receive a free art print of one of Karen Gross’s artworks signed by the artist for their campus.\n\nThe deadline to register is January 25. \nhttps://lnkd.in/eGXJRqhi",

While exploring Black agriculture in West Virginia, I met a third-generation forager named Ruby Daniels Holland of Creasy Jane's. Her small business focuses on herbs she forages and grows for soaps, teas, salves and more.\n\nForager Ruby explained how Blacks in the Appalachia region relied on foraging to harvest herbs, nuts and fruits to subsist during the harshest periods in American history.\n\nIn conversation, I told her about the mullein leaves I saw growing along a river in McDowell County. She explained that mullein is the herb that is good for respiratory illnesses.\n\n\"Nature will grow for you what you need,\" she told me before explaining how black lung was a common illness for coal miners. The abundance of mullein was the earth providing medicine for the thousands who fought the disease, and in many ways acts as an aromatherapy.\n\nI was blown away by this drop of knowledge that she said so nonchalantly, but with depth.\n\nOne of the areas Ruby talked about is Afrolachian identity, which for her is rooted in Blacks folks who have been intertwined with Native and whites in the area. From that, a culture was birthed.\n\nAt Black Farmers Index, we are excited that she will be leading a workshop in our 2-Day Black agriculture tour on urban foraging.

What they would find were gardens that subsisted us.\n\nMy Uncle Don had the illest garden---tomatoes, leafy greens, strawberries, squash, etc. Then he had an orange and lemon tree. All you had to do was go to the back yard with one of those 11 million plastic bags under your mother's kitchen counter that she saved, and get your fill.\n\nUncle Don was my mother's cherished brother. They grew up in Lafayette, Louisiana, but had family throughout the Acadiana region---from St. Martinville to Broussard. The food was partially ethnic produce from home, and it was also preserving the growing legacy that many Black migrants left when they departed the South. Albeit, much of it was forced.\n\nThat being said, it feels good to work with a L.A. County Farmer, Mr. Charlie Southward of IGH Gardens in Long Beach. Farmer Charlie grew up in Riverside, just east of the city, but his family is from Texas. \n\nAt IGH, we help him grow batches of food to feed seniors and women and children in transitional housing. On this day, we picked some collards for a program that Mr. Southward was donating to. \n\n#urbanagriculture hashtag\n#blackfarmersindex hashtag\n#urbanfarmers"

There is an understandable reticence when you are some \"Yankee\" or out-of-towner who is coming to visit your farm. \n\nDuane's family is from the Carolina's. In fact, he met a couple of distant cousins in a town where his grandfather grew up on a farm. There were even quite of few people that he resembled that I was floored how genetics can retain and disperse. It was really kind of cool to sit back and watch him return to his roots. Many Black folks who family's moved out of the rural South are not afforded those opportunities and eventually lose all contact.\n\nOnce our connections were established, many doors opened and conversations flowed.

But the short story is Dr. Releford is a podiatrist who focused on diabetes. His specialty was to prevent amputation. When he saw the diets of his most chronic patients, he began to advise them to eat better. But how can you when most live in areas where healthy food is overwhelmed by fast food. So he started initiatives and wrote a book.\n\nBut food access was still key, so about 2 years ago, he bought a ranch. To own property in L.A. County is a hump, but to own that much is beyond impressive. Plus Dr. Releford turned this ranch around in 1 year. It has tunnel houses, orchards, chickens, vineyard and other elements that make it a farm, event space, retreat site and local favorite happy hour when the sun sets and the heat cools off.\n\nBut the foodie and herb-lover in me cannot get over the nuts, lavender and lavender-sugar I purchased there. A walnut farmer told me that once you taste a fresh walnut, you will not look back. Those almonds and walnuts from Bloom Ranch melted in my mouth. I should've bought more bags, and hoping to see them in their online store\n\nLike I advise most folk who want to buy from a Black farmer, start with 1 commodity or regular provision in your home that you can purchase from them.

The story centered the horrid experiences of Black Colorado ranchers, Nicole and Courtney Mallery.\n\nIn January 2023, I launched a series titled \"Get Out\" in Ark Republic. It detailed the Mallery's ongoing traumatic engagement in a predominantly white town in Colorado. Indeed, it was something like a horror movie. They told us that no one believed their story, which made it a whole season of the Twilight Zone.  \n\nBut I believed them as I have been working with Black farmers for 4 years now and some of the stories are heartbreaking. What I didn't expect was the response from the public when the first story came out and I partnered with Black Farmers Index for a campaign drawing attention to the Mallery's dire situation.\n\nThe public placed pressure on law enforcement, local officials and even the other media to report on the issue. Their immediate dangers subsided somewhat, but they are still fighting the good fight. What is incredible to know is that Peele and members of his production crew saw it important to tell the story too.\n\nSome months ago, I learned that the wheels of pre-production started churning with the Mallery's in it. A few weeks ago, received word that Peele was given the greenlight to do a series. It will stream on Peacock.\n\nSo this is a thank you to those who supported this small independent Black-owned press called Ark Republic. This is testament of how critical small press members are in the ecosystem. Support your local press, and support Black-owned media and media professionals.\n\nThe Mallery's are having a Juneteenth celebration at their Freedom Acres Ranch this weekend. Wishing them the best.

While in St. Martinville, I finally get to see sugar cane season. \n\nHere I am at a stop where Charles Durand had so much wealth from his sugar cane plantations that for his daughter's wedding in 1795, he decorated the trees and spider webs with gold and silver dust along the canopy trail leading up to his home. \n\nThis resonates with me because my family farmed land in this rural town and were forced off this land when they refused to give it to a local white brute. But here I am returned, collecting data and re-establishing roots. Bienvenue Lalwizyan (Welcome to Louisiana)"

On what timeline do you think you can wire should you decide to invest?\"\n\nI have had to shake down too many co-investors over the last few years who have committed money to founders, only to drag their feet weeks, months, and in some cases, more than a year(!) to pay up.",

Needlessly complicating this early on just reduces the likelihood the founder succeeds at that game and that the company grows as quickly as it can.\n\nIf an investor is intransigent on their demands that will slow the company down, seriously consider telling them \"thanks, but we'll look elsewhere\" and move on.

Owning 5% of a $100mm company sounds great until you realize you have a $20mm fund and a mandate to return 3x that.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you'll want a total addressable market upwards of $10bn, that is growing, and a compelling narrative that you'll capture enough to make that investor's fund back to them a few times over at exit.\n\nIf you don't have that, it doesn't mean you're not building a great company -- it just might not be a company that's right for venture funding. There are lots of other kinds of funding options out there -- loans, crowdfunding, private equity investment, non-venture angel investors, etc. \n\nIt's a very, very small slice of companies that are right for venture funding.

Did it feel like a real conversation, or were they busy typing notes on their computer as you talked? \n\nGrowing up by my parents’ hospital in India, I saw what medicine is supposed to be: deeply personal, built on trust, and grounded in human connection. My parents didn’t just diagnose illnesses—they knew their patients, their families, their struggles.\n\nOver the past two years, my wife and I spent considerable time in San Francisco hospitals as we welcomed our baby and navigated various health challenges. We met doctors and nurses who, despite working under immense pressure with packed schedules, showed genuine care. Yet we witnessed how the burden of documentation and administrative work pulled them away from patients, adding strain to an already demanding profession.\n\nThis experience reinforced what I've known all along - nothing is more important than good health and healthcare is not a profession, but a calling. As I reflected at the close of 2024, I knew my next chapter needed to be at the intersection of healthcare and AI. I'm really excited to be joining Ambience Healthcare on their product team, and grateful to Ahmed and Nikhil for the opportunity to be part of this journey.\n\nAmbience is using AI to give healthcare providers what they need most - reduced time on admin tasks, more time with patients and more time for their own families. This technology is already making a real impact at world’s leading hospitals like Cleveland Clinic and UCSF.\n\nThis also marks the end of my fulfilling 4-year journey at EarnIn. I’m deeply grateful to the EarnIn team, especially Ram, Yair, Karolina and Chood for their mentorship and support - building something truly meaningful for millions of everyday Americans.\n\nNext time you’re at UCSF or Cleveland Clinic, and your doctor is fully present—listening, not typing, ask if they’re using Ambience. I’d love to hear what they share with you.\n\n#Nextplay",

Similar to the old Microsoft, Google has been complacent in product innovation and as a result is on the defensive - for probably the first time in a decade.\n\nFully expect Google to have integrated AI features in Docs/Sheets/Slides in the future. All this is great for consumers. But productivity startups building office like features on top of GPT will likely struggle to differentiate themselves.\n\nDocs users: Would this convince you to give Office another try?",

Medical societies in several countries have already issued guidelines to doctors on how to spot and treat this rare reaction. \n\nThere is a steep rise in vaccine skepticism given the *tiny* (~4 in a million) risk of clots. Today’s news on FDA pausing J&J shots will only add fuel to the fire. Good news is that doctors know how to recognize and treat this rare condition. \n\nGreat explanation from the Economist on this topic.\n\n“This combination of blood clots and low platelet counts is something that doctors know how to diagnose and treat, says Jean Marie Connors, a haematologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston. It resembles a condition seen in some people who are given heparin, a drug used widely to treat blood clots. For unknown reasons, some people develop an immune reaction to heparin, which results in blood clotting so profound that it depletes their platelets. The same reaction appears to be provoked by the vaccine.”",

Contrary to popular opinion, US seems to be doing quite well - with most vaccinations total (9.3M followed by China at 9M), and 5th highest per capita (after Israel, UAE, Bahrain and UK). Of course a lot more should and can be done.\n\n2. California is doing miserably and needs to get its act together. Only 27% of doses available have been administered, and one of the lowest per capita in the US (ranking 12th from the bottom). Especially alarming given the acute need, with uncontrolled disease spread and 1.5 months of shelter in place. In contrast, Texas is leading both in terms of total doses and one of the highest per capita immunizations. \n\n3. After initial hiccups, a sharp uptick in vaccines administered per capita (in the US) in the last week. Hopefully with the new admin coming in, and a change in policy of releasing the entire available supply (instead of saving it for a 2nd dose) will further increase number of people getting the vaccine. Noteworthy, on an aggregated basis the US has only used 36% of available doses so far - so vaccination is not yet supply constrained.",

The first time I went to a game, I barely understood hockey (and honestly, still don’t fully get the whole off-sides thing).\n\nBut here’s what I did understand: something special was happening.\n\nWhen’s the last time you watched a women’s hockey game?\n\nAs a 5’2” woman from LA, I assumed I wouldn’t look like the average hockey fan. But when I walked into the arena, I didn’t feel out of place at all.\n\nThere were:\n\n🏒 Couples of all ages and genders, cheering on their teams\n\n🏒 Local kids’ teams, watching history being made\n\n🏒 Little girls with their dads, seeing a future for themselves in the sport\n\nI remember going to Lakers games with my dad growing up. But back then, the only thing I could see myself becoming was one of the cheerleaders, the Laker Girls.\n\n80% of Fortune 500 female CEOs played a sport growing up. Eighty percent.\n\nSports teach teamwork, risk-taking, and humility, all skills that make people better leaders in business. And now, there’s another, badass, tier of sport for young girls to see themselves in. \n\nHaving these leagues helps women strive more to be in sports in the first place. \n\nIf I could invest in women’s sports like a stock, I’d be all in.",

I wanted this campaign to be different.\n\nWe ended up doing a survey with hundreds of female founders on how their fundraising convos were changing given the COVID-19 pandemic that had just started. We also asked them where they felt like they needed the most help and what they felt was now the likelihood that they would reach their goal.\n\nThis gave us a few insights:\n\n1️⃣ Problem: Female founders were struggling primarily with investor networks. Many of them first-time founders, they felt that they didn’t have the same level of networks as many of their male founder friends.\n\n❇️ SOLUTION: Get together a bunch of co-investors who actively invest in that stage and create spaces for female founders to build those networks.\n\n2️⃣ Problem: More than half of them felt like they weren’t going to reach their initial fundraising goal and would have to cut costs.\n\n❇️ SOLUTION: Build a partner network that gave exclusive discounts on software and services to female founders to help them cut costs.\n\nWhat started as a “marketing” campaign around understanding how founders were handling COVID-19 shutdowns quickly lent itself well to creating new partner networks, high-value events, and allowed for the impact to go beyond just another VC blog post. In my opinion, that's what good integrated marketing should look like.",

We uncovered what helps founders stand out in their applications and how to navigate finding the right program for them. \n\nTLDR: 🚀 Accelerators aren’t for everyone—but they’re game-changers for the right companies.\n\n📋 Top Tips for Your Application:\n- Quantify your progress: Include clear traction metrics (e.g., “20% month-over-month growth” or “500 beta users with 60% retention”).\n- Show your founder-market fit: Share your unique expertise or lived experience that positions you to solve the problem better than anyone else.\n- Keep it real: “Your story matters more than your slides. Investors don’t back ideas—they back the people behind them.\n\n💡 What Accelerators Are Helpful For:\n- Early-stage startups looking for clarity in their go-to-market strategy or fundraising approach.\n- Building a network: “80% of founders who join Techstars find their first major customer or partner through the program,” as noted in the webinar.\n- Founders who thrive on feedback and iterative improvement in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.\n\n🛠️ Tactical Strategies for Founders:\n- Research past cohorts and mentors: Tailor your application by citing specific Techstars alumni or experts you admire.\n- Prepare a 30-second pitch: Clearly state the problem, your solution, traction so far, and why now is the right time.\n- Leverage early feedback: Test your pitch deck with customers or peers to refine clarity and impact.\n\nA huge thank you to our incredible panelists Sylvia Bouloutas, Vance D., Ahmed A. Mirza, Steve Bernard for sharing actionable advice. \n\nIf you’re a founder who missed this one, we’ve got more coming. Keep an eye out for future Mercury Raise events (link below).",

Creating these moments of connection between female founders and funders continues to be one of the most rewarding parts of my career. \n\nSpecial thank you to our three brilliant guests, Christina L. of FPV Ventures, Chelcie Taylor of Notable Capital, and Abbie Strabala of True Wealth Ventures and Queer VC, who added so much depth to the discussion. Your presence and contributions are what made this brunch truly special! \n\nAlso shoutout to the Mercury team who helped to put this together: Hae Rang P., Kelly Kruger, & Alexis Wiseman!",

We don't believe that selling to startups should mean that we give people a subpar experience. This is evident in what we build with Raise (Raise team pictured below!) and with the broader marketing organization. \n\nIt takes a team of thoughtful, kind, and brilliant people to make our vision a reality.

Even I, who basically worked at ✨the✨  Lean Startup, has forgotten some of the most important practices. \n\nA MVP doesn't always mean your product's sellable V1, customer validation can come in many forms, and being \"lean\" is not the same thing as \"lean startup methodology\". \n\nI'm partnering up with the folks at Solved (Pablo Pinto) to develop a playbook on Lean Startup principles, highlighting case studies, failure modes, and practical ways to apply it. \n\nCheck it out and let me know what you think.

I do tremendously well at hosting events, but often I found attending events to be a bit more daunting than my extroverted peers in years past. \n\nThe thing is, I think more shy louds should be community organizers. At all my events, I’m intimately aware of how those who are just as smart, but maybe a little more quiet, navigate the room. And I’m constantly trying to create an environment that’s not pretentious or chaotic for no other reason than feeling like my event is popular.\n\nSo many tech events suck honestly.

For one, don’t hire a personal brand consultant/PR person/social media expert to make you something you aren’t.\n\nI get this constantly from founders who are struggling with, in particular, imposter syndrome and are scared of showing their true selves. \n\nIf you aren’t a raging extrovert, don’t force yourself. On the flip side, I’m not going to make you seem kind and empathetic when you’re not like that in your day-to-day life.\n\nThat’s inherently not sustainable, and that’s not the point of personal branding. You should be telling your authentic story and background & be focused on connecting with the right audiences.\n\nSome other hot takes of mine as someone who’s been in the personal brand consultant role:\n\n- I would never write the social for badly written articles. That’s not good personal branding, and if someone has the time to write 1000+ word articles and not a LI post, I question if they actually understand personal branding.\n\n- I would never make someone an influencer for the sake of “going viral”.

(stunning revelation I know) As soon as I suggest posting more, people start to show signs of fear.\n\n⚡️ Experimentation is more important than depth in the beginning. \n\nEverything is about learning.\n\nPeople are scared of being misunderstood so they resort to “well I should write a whole blog post on this”.\n\n⚡️ There are more types of content than a blog posts.\n\nPeople assume that their thoughts are worth reading when social media is literally a stream of everyone’s thoughts.\n\n⚡️ Why should they read on? Why waste their time? A name brand and big title will only get you so far. \n\nTLDR: The ROI needs to be front and center of anything you produce.

Chen, Jeremy Becker, Michelle Kwok, Sam Park, & many others) \n\nDuring the promotion of the event, I got flooded with messages from other founders and operators, saying how this discourse on the subject was so needed. \n\nI started thinking about other ways I could help founders.\n\n➡ I found a job on LinkedIn and a few months later, found myself in marketing at 500 Global. \n\nThrough 500 Global, I felt like I got a masterclass for early-stage startups & wanted to move to the operator side.\n\nI loved helping 500 with their roll out of ESG & wanted to work in tech, but only for a company that I felt mission aligned with. Thank you to Tracy Barba who was the first to teach me so much about this space.\n\nScrolling through 2000+ startups in our portfolio, I happened to find one that was from a serial founder & long term focused.\n\nWhat happened next?\n➡ I didn’t get a referral.\n➡ I didn’t have some “in”.\n➡ I literally applied on LinkedIn.\n\nSo, lesson here is still apply. Even if it's just another job on LinkedIn. Even when you've gone through a million and one pivots. Apply. \n\nAnd yes, I still work there. 🙂 \n\n#marketing #startups #tech",

    "Natalie Riso's post 2yr ago": "I was sitting at a cafe this weekend when a guy next to me glanced over and commented on what I was doing. “Do you work in finance?”\n\nMe: “I’m just studying ESG investing.”\n\n(ESG refers to environmental, social, & governance issues.) \n\nPerson: “Yeah I left it a long time ago. I used to work in carbon credits. The ESG stuff is all a fraud. The market will trick itself into making itself feel like it's doing good, but it’s not going to save the world.”\n\n“So, do you believe there’s something better?”\n“No.”\n“So, do you believe the government will have to fix our problems?”\n“Not until it’s too late.”\n\n❗ Saying it doesn't work doesn't solve anything.❗ \n\nWhile skepticism is certainly healthy and ESG may not be the perfect solution, I certainly don't think we should stop people from studying all of the possible tools. \n\nWe should be encouraging more people to find solutions than to leave the space altogether. \n\n#finance #investing #esg",

Some key findings:\n\n💰 Founders are trying to find cash, from multiple sources. Think grants, venture debt, etc. I offered to sit down with anyone who wanted pitch advice and had a number of convos with founders who needed to increase their runway. \n\nThe LTSE team is maybe working on something to help these founders.

So authenticity really resonates. \n\n3️⃣ Consistency\n\nYes, consistency is important on LinkedIn.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I averaged 1/3 of the engagements on posts when I wasn’t posting at least once a week.\n\nEllie is super consistent while continually creating engaging content.\n\nLastly, I’d add that Ellie seems like an awesome person overall (we’ve never met, but I’d love to!), but the above is why I think her content performs so well. 😄",

If you are polite and can add value, you aren’t. I take calls with students. Lots of professionals. \n\n💠 Ask for a meeting right after connecting.\nToo soon. I don’t even know you yet! This is true for college students and salespeople.\n\n✅ DO ✅\n\n💠Time your personal pitch.\nIf it’s over 5 minutes, you’ve lost me. I know that can feel brutal, but it’s honest.\n\n💠 Make your ask clear.\n“Get to know each other” isn’t a strong case when you could get to know me in other ways. I’m not asking for flattery, but I am asking for clarity and set expectations.\n\n💠 Check your ego.\nThis is for the students at Top 20 schools in particular. As an alumn of one of those schools, if you walk into a meeting with an ego because of where you go to school, you’re giving other kids at those schools a bad rep. Check yo self & your privilege at the door.\n\nFor those of you that take calls with aspiring college students, what would you add? \n\n#students #studentsonlinkedin",

He went on to become one of the foremost experts and researchers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation having most recently left a clinical and research faculty position at the University of Michigan to pursue another dream. At age 56 he became commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel into the US Army Reserves and later assigned to the   US Army Forward Resuscitation Surgical Detachment commissioned deployed to Afghanistan 2021. Read that again. He became a fully commissioned soldier at age 56 in 2021 and is once currently on deployment. Please join me, share this, and thank Dr. Kevin Ward for not only his service in Emergency Medicine but in his service to our county, putting his expertise to work to save the lives of or troops on the frontline."

One of the things that I’ve been trying to emphasize more to them when it comes to philanthropy is that all you really learn when you raise money for a cause is how to ask people for money.  While I think those causes are good,in terms of practical life experience, It doesn’t provide much other than a line on your résumé. I am encouraging our college students to get out and really participate in do-it-yourself activism. If the environment is an issue, then pick up some trash, if poverty is an issue, then tutor at risk children or help build a house, if mental health and depression is an issue, then get out into nursing homes and speak with elderly who have some of the highest rates of depression. But DO more than ASK."

Triaged 97 in 24 hrs. \nI’m sooo over this season.”\n\nCAH means critical access hospital which means this is a very small community hospital somewhere. The hospital ER only has 12 beds. And the the inpatient capacity is only 25 patients. A typical busy day in an ER of This size is maybe 40 to 50 patients.\n\nThey saw 97.\n\nAnd my guess is they only had one doctor. I also have no doubt that some of these people were critically ill with complications of pneumonia or influenza and needed to be transferred to higher levels of care.  \n\nThis is non-sustainable and why so many people are leaving our specialty.\n\nPatients don’t understand at times why they have to wait and what the delay is. This is the reason. Much of it stems from a lack of access to primary care in addition to the huge number of uninsured or uninsured patients.\n\nIf you go to an ER like this, please be kind to the ER  staff.

Unless you’re having  shortness of breath or life threatening bleeding, rethink that decision.\n\nWhile we certainly can tell you what’s wrong, I guarantee that if you need to be admitted,  we are probably gonna load you up in an ambulance after we finish our work up and send you to the hospital where you just had your procedure done.\n\nWhich means you’re gonna probably pay for an additional ambulance ride and….\n\nA second ER visit.\n\nThere….I saved you a trip to the ER and  perhaps a second ambulance ride."

We navigated the pain of dial-up internet at our parents' house, waiting for a single page to load while someone yelled at us to get off the phone. We’ve been on social media since Friendster and MySpace (some of you might have to ChatGPT those). We adapted to each new wave—embracing change rather than fearing it.\n\nBut let’s be real: as much as we love Spotify (I listen every day), nothing quite compares to the feeling of getting off work at a high school job in the mid-90s and heading to Best Buy to spend your paycheck on new CDs. The rush of tearing off the plastic, flipping through the liner notes, and popping in Pearl Jam, Counting Crows, DMB, or whatever else was about to blow your mind on the ride home—that was an experience.\n\nWe didn’t just watch technology evolve—we grew with it. We are digital immigrants who embraced every new frontier, and that ability to adapt, learn, and integrate change is what keeps us ahead today.\nWhat are your favorite memories from straddling the analog and digital worlds? Let’s hear them.\n\n#TechEvolution #Adaptation #DigitalTransformation #90sKids #FromWordProcessorToAI",

On occasions throughout the year, I like to bring out photos of my Grandfather Jack Clifford, and some family relics from his time serving in the Army during WWII. These artifacts serve as powerful reminders never to forget history and the insidious hatred that lurks beneath the surface of society. It's crucial to expose and combat this hate, ensuring that the sacrifices of our ancestors were not in vain.\n\nWhen I entered this world, I had the privilege of briefly knowing a resilient man, as tough as they come. Despite his toughness, his love for us was evident. I recall how he would playfully toast morning bagels on the gas range, sometimes allowing his hand, which had lost feeling, to catch fire just to elicit a reaction from us grandkids.\n\nI once accompanied him to a hardware store on Long Island where he boldly smoked inside. When asked to extinguish his cigarette, he winked at me before casually snuffing it out in the palm of his hand. As a child, I was curious about his wartime experiences, but he would always deflect, stating his reluctance to revisit those memories.\n\nTo all the veterans, thank you for your unwavering service to our country.",

I don't have a green thumb and I am horrible at keeping plants alive, and yet somehow it lives on. It survived a move, two energetic toddlers, a cat, and a new dog. Like myself, it has good days and weeks and bad ones. Sometimes I go weeks without caring for it and in other seasons it thrives just on its own. For me, it’s a great reminder that grief doesn’t shrink it grows.\n\nGrief grows from absolute horrendous unspoken pain to something we learn to tolerate as part of life. When we are young we think we are immune to this pain, this horror, this agony but it inevitably will land at each of our doorsteps many times in the best life. The longer we live the greater the odds become that we will suffer repeated loss. The harder we love the harder it becomes to say goodbye.\n\nGrief never goes away but it can become a companion to love. Forever part of something bigger and not just an endless hole. Acceptance allows space for old memories of laughs shared and wonderful times. We discover new ways to honor and include that person in the here and now. Some of us decide to switch careers and find more meaning in our work. Whatever way that one decides to handle your own grief, please know that it will change and you will change with it.",

While the rest of us in corporate America enjoyed working from the comfort of our homes over the past two years, she was on the front lines helping the school navigate a global pandemic and remote learning, resulting in strong increases in student registrations and applications. She did all of this while raising our two beautiful babies. \n\nVery soon she is joining an amazing nonprofit, which provides K-12 teachers with what to teach and how to teach it—online, for free, to be shared broadly. I can’t wait to watch all of the great work that she does.\n\nYou are a “Super Nova”!!\n#marketing #communications #work #education #learning",

You’re Not Alone.\n\nThe demand for top technical talent is skyrocketing, but the talent pool remains incredibly limited.\n\n📉 The Talent Gap in AI & ML:\n⚡ 1.9 million software developers in the U.S.— less than 1% of the workforce\n⚡ Just ~24K AI/ML engineers in the U.S.\n⚡ Globally, only 500K–700K AI/ML engineers\n⚡ Meanwhile, 97 million AI-related jobs are projected worldwide by 2025\n\nWith fierce competition for talent, how can companies successfully attract and hire AI/ML engineers?\n\n🎯 Andrew Reinhardt, Talent Partner at Raya Advisory, who has scaled engineering teams (including AI/ML) at Meta, LinkedIn, and The Climate Corporation, shares proven strategies:\n\n✅ Lead with Purpose – Engineers want to work on meaningful projects. Example: Perplexity’s CEO said top AI engineers join them to disrupt Google Search. Your company needs a compelling mission to attract the best.\n\n✅ Expand Sourcing Channels – Go beyond LinkedIn. Tap into universities, boot camps, hackathons, Kaggle, and GitHub.\n\n✅ Leverage Specialized Recruiters – Firms like Raya Advisory specialize in AI/ML hiring, providing access to vetted talent pools.\n\n✅ Invest in Upskilling & Training – Develop internal talent for specialized AI roles instead of relying solely on external hires.\n\n✅ Streamline the Hiring Process – Set clear expectations, eliminate long feedback loops, and drive decisions quickly to avoid losing top candidates.\n\n✅ Over-Communicate – Keep candidates engaged with consistent check-ins. Text messages have a 50% higher response rate than emails.\n\n🚀 Hiring AI talent is tough, but the right strategies make all the difference.\n\n📌 Full article linked in the comments!\n\n♻️  Reshare if you found this helpful so more people can benefit.\n👉 Follow our Substack (link in comments) for more insights on hiring top AI talent.\n\n#AIJobs #Hiring #AIRecruiting #TechnicalHiring #MLRoles #HireEngineers #FutureOfWork",

Here are the key takeaways:\n\n🔹 AI-Powered Hiring: More AI capabilities will enhance sourcing, screening, and candidate communication—making the process faster and more efficient.\n\n🔹 AI in Performance Management: Feedback should be timely and ongoing (think Radical Candor), yet most companies still do performance reviews only 1-2 times a year. Imagine AI-driven sentiment analysis on Slack, emails, and video calls providing real-time coaching to help employees improve continuously. That’s the future.\n\n🔹 Agentic AIs Managing Agentic AIs: Some companies already have AI agents performing tasks—but now, they’re also building AI agents that manage other AI agents. 🤯\n\n🔹 AI & Humans Side by Side: The future of work will involve humans and AI agents collaborating. AI Agents, just like humans, will need to be evaluated, managed, and empowered. This shift requires rethinking company structures & HR systems.\n\n🔹 Still Early Days: Despite the buzz, AI-driven recruiting and talent management tools are still in their infancy—with massive room for improvement.\n\n💡 The takeaway? AI is revolutionizing hiring and talent management, but we are just getting started. Companies that embrace these changes early will have a competitive edge.\n\n👥 It was great reconnecting with Tatyana Mamut, PhD & Zoe Vatanparast and meeting Sydney Levin, Lauren Dickinson, Sahar Alizadeh, Misty Dodd, Samy Movassaghi, PhD, Fanni Gabor, and many more!\n\n👉 Follow Yasi Baiani for more insights on AI & the future of work.\n♻️ Reshare if you found this valuable!\n\n#FutureOfWork #AgenticAI #AIinHR #GenAI #TalentManagement Raya",

Imposter syndrome creeps in no matter how accomplished we are:\n\n🤔 Can I do this?\n🤔 Did I get it right?\n🤔 Am I successful enough?\n\nFor founders and entrepreneurs, these doubts can be even louder as we constantly navigate the unknown. I see this in job seekers and candidates too—many of them exceptional, with stellar resumes, yet one rejection makes them question everything.\n\n💡 So here’s your reminder: You are great. You are enough. You got this.\n\nYesterday, while heading from an Influencer Lunch with top CEOs, CTOs, and CPOs (thank you, Jon Levy!) to my talk on The Future of AI & Humans at Work at AWS Gen AI, I took a moment to reflect on my own journey over the past year and a half as the founder of Raya.\n\nWhen I started this business, my mind was full of questions:\n\n❓ Can I pull this off?\n❓ Does it make sense to turn down a C-level role and build something from scratch?\n❓ Is it rational to leave behind a steady paycheck 💸 and take on all the risks?\n\nLooking back, I’m so glad I bet on myself. \n\nFast forward to today:\n\n✅ Raya has some of the world’s biggest companies as clients.\n✅ Some of the most respected brands want to partner with us.\n✅ Clients trust our small but mighty team to work alongside theirs and drive impact.\n\nBut here’s the truth—this journey wasn’t just about me believing in myself. It was about the incredible people who believed in me from day one. You supported me with ideas, connections, and trust. You made intros to CEOs, founders, and executives who helped turn this vision into reality. \n\nYou know who you are!\n\n🙏 I appreciate YOU. Our success at Raya is because of YOU. 💙\n\nTagging a few of you here—thank you for being part of this journey!\n\nIf you’re questioning yourself today, remember this: Believe in yourself, and others will believe in you too.💯\n\n👉Have you had some doubts in your mind about big decisions in the past?

    "Yasi Baiani's post 1mo ago": "DeepSeek is spooking everyone! Why? 🧕 👻 🫣 \n\nDeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, just launched its latest AI model and its performance is on par or better than OpenAI's ChatGPT. \n\nDeepSeek claims to train its models with less than $6M worth of computing power from Nvidia's H800 chips (cheaper GPUs) while other companies like OpenAI reportedly spent over $100M to develop comparable models. \n\n🔹 The companies that got biggest hit by this news are: \n* OpenAI & Anthropic (the direct competitors with DeepSeek from product and business model perspective -- DeepSeek is offering its AI assist subscription at only $0.5/month versus ChatGPT's at $20/month).  \n* Meta, Google, and Microsoft (All the biggest investors and players in LLMs, but their business models are very different from DeepSeek). \n* Nvidia: the massive demand for its GPUs to build AI is now under question. The company lost $520 billion market cap today with the news of DeepSeek! \n\n🔹 If DeepSeek could use cheaper GPUs and a lot less memory to train its models, Nvidia's future is threatened as other AI players can learn to do the same, and demand for Nvidia's GPUs could drop. \n\n🔹 On the other hand, some analysts are questioning DeepSeek's claims! They believe that $6M isn't a reflection of true costs; they didn't account for all prior research and experiments on architecture, algorithms, and data in that $6M. \n\n🔹 Marc Andreessen, who initially tweeted on 1/24 that DeepSeek is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs and an open-source gift to the world seems to now have a different feeling?! 🤔 Yesterday he tweeted that DeepSeek is AI's Sputnik moment - referring to when Soviet Union beat the U.S. into space with the launch of the first satellite into orbit. \n\nTakeaways from DeepSeek news:\n✅  It's a good reminder that not always the first mover is the biggest winner. \n✅ Many assumed that OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Google will continue dominate the AI market, and there's limited room for smaller players and startups in AI. DeepSeek story was a good wake-up call that the race still continues, it's more fierce than ever before, and there are so many uncertainties ahead about who will be the top winners in the AI market.\n✅ No company is immune in a free market! Not even the largest company in the world like Nvidia or the most well-funded player like OpenAI.  \n\n👉 What's your take on this news?\n👉 What do you think will be the future of AI? \n👉 Who will be the winner of the race? \n\nShare your thoughts below 👇 \n\n#deepseek #AIcompetition #AIfuture #OpenAI #AI #Nvidia",

AI will unlock solutions to critical “jobs to be done,” democratizing advanced technology like never before.\n\n✅ The Rise of Collaborative AI Systems: 2025 will mark a transition from standalone AI models to ecosystems of AI agents working in concert. Multi-agent systems will revolutionize problem-solving, with specialized agents working together to tackle complex challenges.\n\n✅ Balancing Innovation and Regulation: AI Innovation Will Increase Regulatory Scrutiny and Accelerate the Need for Government Cooperation.\n\n✅ AI Agents Become Prime Targets: As AI systems handle critical tasks, they’ll become prime targets for bad actors. Security and trustworthiness will be more crucial than ever.\n\n✅ Challenges for High-Valuation AI Startups: Overvalued AI startups will face a market reality check in 2025. Founders and investors must recalibrate their strategies for sustainable growth.\n\n✅ Foundation Models: They will have slower progress, and smarter Usage.\n\n✅ Lifelong Learning: A Mandate for Leaders: In a world reshaped by AI, curiosity and adaptability are non-negotiable for leaders. Building a culture of continuous learning will be essential for success.\n\n👉 What do you think?\nWhich prediction excites (or concerns) you the most? Let’s discuss in the comments!\n\n👉 Link to the full article is in the comments.\n\n#AI #Leadership #Innovation #FutureOfWork",

That's what will differentiate you from robots and AI agents.\n➡️ If you are interested in climate tech, get in there.\n\n👉 What did I miss?

If anything I’m so grateful for the opportunity to work with such incredible clients and teams. \n\nEarly in December, I promised myself to try to unplug between Christmas and New Year. Soon after, multiple of our clients came to us with the ask to support them for a few time sensitive hires and crafting their 2025 strategic plans.\n\nOur moto at Raya is: customers always come first! 💯\n\nSo I unblocked my calendar and was working most of the last two weeks of the holidays. \n\nMultiple of my team members also decided to work during the holidays to meet our clients’ needs. Thank you team! 🙏💙\n\nNot only we didn’t mind it at all, we felt fortunate to be in the position to work with these incredible clients — many of which are high growth companies with fast pace. \n\nWe ♥️what we do! \n\nSaying all that, I decided to take the next two days fully off to refresh and get ready for a bigger and better 2025 ahead of us. \n\nMy hot take to share:\n\n❇️ Always put your customers first no matter in which function you are in - would it be a founder, c-suite, product, customer success, or engineering.\n\n❇️ If you are an entrepreneur and founder building a business, I see you. I hope you’re  enjoying the ride! 🤩🎢\n\n❇️ Make sure you adjust and adapt to your company’s needs and pace. \n\n❇️ If you go hard at it at times to meet important milestones or deadlines, leave some time to recover and regain your energy. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.🏖️\n\n❇️ Try to position yourself to do things that you truly love and enjoy! That’s when work feels like play.⛹️‍♀️\n\nHappy 2025! \n\n#worklifeharmony #worklifeingration #wokrlifebalance",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 2mo ago": "🎁 My 2025 gifts for all the job seekers. 🥳\n\nIn 2024, my team and I interviewed close to 1,000 people across all the roles we’ve hired for our clients. We placed candidates in VP of Product, VP of Marketing, VP of Engineering and similar roles in some of the hottest AI and other tech companies. \n\nWe all know that this job market is arguably the toughest job market of the last 15 years. \n\n👉 Below, I shared a few tips we observed that helped candidates stand out and land their dream jobs. 🎁\n\n👉 Also, I'm offering 5, 30-minute free calls with myself for resume/LinkedIn profile review and feedback, career advice, or any similar topic. If you are interested, put in comments \"Interested\". In one week, I will do a drawing for the winners. 🎁\n\nTips on how to land your dream job in 2025:\n1) Make sure you build up your LinkedIn profile. Add “skills” under each role you had. Bring the details you have on your resume, to your LinkedIn profile. That way you have the highest chance to stand out in recruiters’ key word searches. \n\n2) Don’t spray and pray. You need to approach your job search strategically and be really targeted. Narrow down the top companies or types of companies you want to go after. Then figure out why and how you can compel them that you are the best candidate for their roles.\n\n3) Network, network, network. Network with people in the companies you want to work for; network with recruiters like ourselves who have access to jobs that never even get posted on any job boards.\n\n4) Visual impact counts. First impressions matter. Make sure you have a solid, high quality picture on your LinkedIn profile. Use a good cover photo that’s illustrative of who you are and your personal brand. \n\n5) Get your story down. Practice and role play with friends. Even if you have been impacted by RIFs or got fired, if you have good reasons and can demonstrate the learnings, everyone understands these things could happen.  \n\n6) Know your elevator pitch and highlight the results you drove. In 5 minutes you should be able to tell a recruiter or hiring manager what you have done, and more importantly the business results you drove; if you can’t, you will lose them.\n\n7) Pay it forward. If you find access to recruiters or hiring managers, refer them another person you know might be a good fit for the role they are hiring for. If you see an interesting role posted on LinkedIn, tag others who might be a fit or send the link to them. The karma will come back to you.  \n\n👉 Anything I missed? If so, please add them below for other job seekers to benefit.\n\nI hope these tips help you approach your job search more strategically in 2025 and land your dream job. 🤩\n\nHappy New Year from all of us at Raya Advisory!\n\n#careeradvice #jobseekers #gethired",

You can embrace it and use it to gain a competitive edge or resist it and fall behind. 🚀  \n\n2) Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, Co-founder of Clerisy Gilt & GLAMSQUAD, reminded us that if you want to build something bigger than yourself, never lose sight of hustling, cold calling/emailing to prospects/partners, and getting up when you fail. Even to date after so much success building multiple companies, she's the one doing cold reachouts to potential partners/clients/talents for her portfolio companies. 👏 \n\n3) Hearing Nina Vaca's story on how to build Pinnacle Group from 0 to $1+bn company with a lot of recognition and accolades -- such an inspiring story. 😍 \n\n4) Hearing Christina Wallace, who's an #HBS Lecturer and (so much more), talking about how to build a Portfolio Life and Career that's a reflection of our various interests and skills. Hint: Read her book and you learn how to do this. 📊 \n\n5) Seeing my HBS friends and meeting my fellow HBSWA board members in real life were the highlights.  Leslie Crowe, Stephanie Swingle, Maria Baibakova, Gulum Williams, Elizabeth Crabill, Heather Myers, Kathleen  A Murray, and many more.  💚 \n\n#HBS #womenleaders #leadership",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 5mo ago": "It's great to be in NYC for another Flybridge Founder Week -- one of my favorite events of the year. \n\nWhat I love about this annual event is that it's packed with high-value contents from founders to founders and the opportunity to meet high-caliber people who are building scalable businesses. \n\nThese have been the highlights of the events for me:\n\n❇ I loved seeing my friend and incredibly inspiring founder, Shiza Shahid, taking the stage and sharing stories about how to build a substantial business, Our Place, in a short few years. Building a 9-digit revenue business and having people like Selena Gomez getting behind your product in 5 years are impressive milestones -- to say the least. 👏 😍 \n\n❇ What she shared very much resonated with me (and I often provide the same advice to companies we work with): In order to build a great business not only you need to have the best products, but all parts of your business including design, operation, customer service, marketing, etc have to work well together in synchrony. You need to keep the bar high on all fronts to keep the momentum and drive results. \n\n❇ It was great to hear the panel of investors from A16Z, Insights Partners, Craft Ventures, and Threshold talking about what they look for in founders and startups for Series A and beyond. The gist of it is that what drives investors' interest is \"sustainable and repeatable growth\". The \"perfect\" founders and companies don't exist. Own your mistakes and focus on building a business and delivering sustainable growth.    \n\n❇ Love hearing some growth hacking tips on marketing and sales processes from James Theuerkauf, Julisa Salas,  Will Greene, and Zach Shefska. \n\n❇ Spending time with people I admire including Jeffrey Bussgang, Chip Hazard, Jesse Middleton,  Katie Kirsch, Zina Ajlouny, and many others was great.\n\nI also very much enjoyed the walking dinner tour last night -- organized by one and only Cherae Robinson. 👏 👏  \n\nP.S. I missed the names of some of the amazing people I met last night/today. \nPlease tag your name below or comment, so we can stay connected. \n\n#founders #entrepneuers",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 5mo ago": "Recently, I had the opportunity to share insights about the executive search process and hiring trends in collaboration with Vidur Dewan (Partner @  Artisanal Talent) and Sam Wallace (Partner @ Wilton & Bain) hosted by one and only Jessica H.. 🤩 \n\nBelow, I shared some of the takeaways from the panel. I hope these help more people who are looking for their next leadership role and trying to navigate the executive search process:\n\n✅ AI roles are surging: Not only there's a high demand for technical AI roles, but also there's an emergence of business AI roles. To take advantage of this trend, engrain yourself into understanding the AI nots and bolts, be the user of AI tools, shape your point of view, and be a champion of change/adopting AI in your organization.  \n\n✅ Leadership roles have been consolidating: We see the emergence of CPTO roles; we also see more companies rolling up product, design, and engineering under one leader, would it be CPO, CTO, or COO. As a leader, work on upskilling your hardskills and sharpen your leadership skills, so that you can take on broader scope. \n\n✅ Middle management is shrinking: From large companies such as Meta and Amazon to smaller players, the organizations are getting flatter with the goal of gaining more efficiencies. Focus on delivering real value and solving real problems to make yourself indispensable.  \n\n✅ Landing a great job is half skills & half story-telling: Only YOU know your own story; you are the best person positioned to help others understand your story and the why behind every career decision. Work on the \"art of story-telling\" to help hiring managers and recruiters understand the greatness in you and your skills. \n\n✅ Networking, networking, networking: That's always been a golden rule for landing a great job. That's even more important given the current imbalanced demand and supply in the job market. So don't just submit resume and hope someone will get back to you; identify and reach decision makers and influencers (internal recruiters, executive search partners, hiring managers, etc).\n\nI'm sure you are reading these and thinking: \"This is a lot of work! How do I do that!?\" I agree these steps need work, but if you approach your job search \"strategically\" and continuously working on your own upskilling (by learning AI and other skills), you will have a much better result in landing your dream job!  \n\n#hiring #executivesearch #recruiting #gethired Raya",

It's great to introduce creativity and unconventional things to make professional events more personal and fun. \n\n❇ The caliber of attendees and how the multi-day summit was organized enabled deep conversations and close connections.

    "Yasi Baiani's post 6mo ago": "Recently, I had the opportunity to share my learnings and insights from \"Launching Products Globally\" with an amazing audience at Plug and Play Tech Center with the presence of global audience including entrepreneurs from \nHKSTP - Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation.\n\nHere are a few learnings and insights from the evening:\n\n1) You need to \"localize\" your product & go-to-market strategy: This doesn't only mean just translating or localizing your product. It's a lot more than that. \nYou need to localize your \"go-to-market\" motion as well. \n\nYou may have product-market-fit (PMF) locally, in the first country/region you launched, but that doesn't mean you can take the same product and go-to-market strategy to launch in a new country/region. As an example at Fitbit, we learned how the French think about fitness (they count walking to a restaurant to get a glass of wine as their \"fitness\") is very different than how Americans define workout and fitness.  So all our marketing and go-to-market strategies had to align with the way locals will see benefits in our products. \n\n2) Having boots on the ground is essential for successful global expansion: You need to have boots on the ground who truly understand the nuances of how to go-to-market, how to sell, and how to deliver your value proposition to customers in different regions. There are a lot of nuances of how to do business locally that will take outsiders to any market a long time to learn. At Cleo, where we had global customers like Salesforce, Redbull, Pepsi, and Uber, we had to have local health Guides to deliver our services with an intimate understanding of customers needs and approaches in that region. \n\n3) Understanding local, cultural, and social aspects is critical to a global expansion success: Even though at the surface things may seem similar in each region, there are a lot of nuances that make your go-to-market strategy and the way you deliver your services resonate with the local customers or not. At Teladoc, we've learned that people in different countries think about their mental health and how to get support for that \"very differently\" than each other. \n\nHuge thank you to my hosts Rahim Amidi, Dr. Yahya Tabesh, Amir Amidi, Ahmadreza Masrour, and Akvile Gustaite, and HKSTP leaders, Albert Wong & Pheona Kan, who are interested in continuing these conversations.\n\nIt was awesome to meet great entrepreneurs and see old friends:  Reza Moghtaderi Esfahani, Daniel Lo, Houman Homayoun, Wayne Chang, Golnaz (Naz) Moeini.\n\n#product #gotomarket #globallaunch #globalbusiness",

This is the first interest rate cut in 4 years. \n\n* This is a jumbo-sized interest rate cut! Fed cut rates by 50-basis-point instead of 25-basis-point which is more common for interest rate changes in an effort to head off a slowdown in the labor market. \n\n* That's great news for job seekers and companies who are eager to open new roles.\n\n* Lower rates are typically associated with a friendlier hiring environment as employers’ bottom lines get a boost from cheaper borrowing costs.\n \n* Not only do lower rates help with a more appealing job market, but they also help the cost of your car, home, and credit card loans be less.\n \n* It's expected that this is the beginning of multiple rounds of rate cuts well into 2025. The very next cut will probably occur after the Presidential election. \n\n#hiring #openroles #recruiting #jobmarket #fed #interestrrate",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 6mo ago": "\"God Mother of AI\", Fei Fei Li, raised $230M for World Lab -- spatial intelligence AI startup.\n\nWhat you need to know and why this is so fascinating:  \n\n💰 This is one of the largest funding rounds for an AI company -- especially as a first round. \n\n🚀  Funding comes from top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, Radical Ventures, NVentures (the venture capital arm of Nvidia), Marc Benioff, and Ashton Kutcher.\n\n🌍  Language models changed how we interact with computers. They enabled software to speak and understand natural languages. However, language is just one way humans reason and communicate. We understand the physical world is spatial -- by seeing images and gestures, walking in spaces, or interacting with things. World Labs aims to create that spatial world via AI. \n\n💻  Per Li, the physical world for computers is seen through cameras, and the computer brain behind the cameras. Turning that vision into reasoning, generation, and eventual interaction involves understanding the physical structure, the physical dynamics of the physical world. And that technology is called spatial intelligence.    \n\n🕶  If World Lab's vision comes to reality, you could imagine taking your favorite book, throwing it into a model, and then literally stepping into it and watching it play out in real time, in an immersive way.\n\n🤖  The most relevant applications of spatial intelligence could be in gaming, visual effects in AR/VR, and robotics (longer-term). \n\nWorld Labs aims to ship its first product in 2025. \n\n* Building a 3D world model is really, really hard; hence, it hasn't been done by any other company yet. It requires overcoming key problems in adjacent but disparate areas such as data, graphics, and AI.\n\n* What to expect? Competition (OpenAI, Figure, and others) will attempt to get into the same domain (if not already have some projects in the work). \n\n👉 What are your thoughts about Worlds Labs vision and ambitions?  \n👉 Will the World Labs team succeed in making spatial intelligence a reality? \n👉 What will be the biggest challenges they have to overcome?  \n\nWorldLabs #artificialintelligence #spatialintelligence",

Invest in #upskilling of your team. Bring in experts to educate your team. \n\n3) Understand the technical opportunities and limitations of AI and ensure to address those in your proposal. Propose a \"phased path\" with a clear timeline, budget, and goals to help your executives understand how your team will go from idea > concept > minimum viable product > and to scaled product. \n\n4) Lay out how you build #responsibleAI offerings and mitigate compliance, privacy, and ethical risks. \n\n5) Testing AI products is different than your typical product. They may need more than your QA. If you build a product for lawyers or doctors, you need those experts to review the model's output. Those types of talent are expensive and they need to be considered as part of your cost and plan. \n\n👉 You can find the link to the full talk in the comments below. \n♻ If you find this post helpful, re-share or like it to help others benefit as well. \n\nThanks, Chilann Chan for executing and bringing this awesome event together. \n\n#AI #productstrategy #AIstrategy #productmanagement #productdevelopment",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 7mo ago": "⚡ 💡 The \"best ideas\" are always controversial! ⚡ 🤔 \n\nThey are not as obvious, and not everyone in the company can see how it will come to life. \n\nIf something is so obvious and easy, every other competitor and player would have already done it. \n\nThat's why getting alignment for your most promising product ideas or business strategies is never easy. \n\nThe bigger the idea, it typically requires more engineering and other types of investments; this makes it even more challenging to get executive buy-in. \n\nI've experienced this often in my work as a product executive and leader in companies such as Fitbit, Teladoc, and Cleo as well as in my work with clients at Raya Advisory.\n\nCome join me, MAHESH YADAV, and 200+ people who've already signed up (Wow!) to hear how to unlock multi-billion dollar opportunities for your company and how to align executives and teams to implement those strategies. \n\nI will talk about key soft skills, business acumen, and technical skills you need to effectively influence others and build alignment. I will share stories about: \n\n- How we got executive alignment and support to build Fitbit's Female Health category which was a controversial topic at first since most of male executives couldn't see the big opportunity around cycle tracking and fertility windows -- which ended up being widely adopted and had over 2.4M users in the first month. \n\n- How collaboratively with involving all the functions and leaders at Cleo, I solidified a product strategy and north star to expand beyond female health and early-stage family support to become an end-to-end caregiving company -- unlocked $270B market opportunity for the company. \n\n- How in our work with Raya clients today we help them assess, present, and implement AI strategies and solutions that are right for their organization. \n\nHuge thank you to Maven team and Gagan Biyani for this Influence at Work Series and for including us. Also, a big thank you to Chilann Chan who has supported us behind the scenes to make this a reality. \n\nJoin LIVE on 8/13, 12:00pm.

He earned 1st place in various races, kept beating his time, and ultimately made it to the county to represent his team this coming week.\n\nHe dreamed and worked incredibly hard to make that dream a reality. 🏊‍♂️ 👏 💙\n\nWhat I tried to instill in my two kids it's not just the aim for \"winning\". But rather the “process” that could lead to success and wins in life. 🤔\n\nHere are the elements I share with them often:\n\n✅ Rule #1 for winning is to \"participate\". Never withdraw cause you are guaranteed you won't get far.\n\n✅ Practice makes everything better. Work hard to master your craft. All the talented and successful people in any field work incredibly hard -- think of Rafael Nadal 🎾 or CEOs of Fortune 500 companies 👩‍💻🧑‍💻as examples.\n\n✅ You are the boss of yourself. This is what I learned from Ski Team Coach and Psychologist. Believe in yourself! Bet on yourself! Think positively and get out there to execute!\n\n✅ Every time you fail and lose, bounce back faster, stronger, and with more determination.\n\nThese rules apply in business, life, sports, and anything in between.\n\nWhat are the steps you take to position yourself for success and win? \n\nToday, I'm a proud Mom and take a pause to celebrate this little dude and his perseverance! 😍\n\n#proudmoment #winning #senseofwinning #coaching",

With two little kids and my mother being a stage 4 cancer patient, I knew I couldn't do that type of \"commute to work\".  \n\n* The company had aggressive goals of delivering 3-4x growth through innovation and M&A. In the past, I've delivered those types of growth both through innovation and M&A (hence they wanted me on their team), but I couldn't see that being a rational business goal in this environment.\n\n* I wanted to pursue my #entrepreneurial path which I had put on hold before joining my previous company. I decided that even though the timing may not be perfect (it will never be in some ways), I will move forward with that. \n\nI officially launched Raya and started building the business. Looking back at this one year later, I couldn't be happier about the decision. \n\nHere are the learnings -- hopefully you all can take something to apply to your career decision: \n\n✅ Know your family/life < > work balance criteria and priorities. \n✅  Don't make career decisions based on fears.  \n✅  Do things differently. Don't follow the herds.\n✅  Have a portfolio career model and create alternative revenue streams.\n✅  Be eager to learn and get out of your comfort zone.  \n\nHope you all dare to pursue what's best for you and define your own path, even if that may be different than the conventional or expected paths. \n\n#LIPostingDay\n#careeradvice #careerexperience #paveyourownpath #worklifeharmony #worklifebalance",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 9mo ago": "I had the honor to give a keynote speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business.\n\nBeing a keynote speaker is nerve-racking for many.\n\nFor me, it's exuberating and energizing.  \n \nAt this point in my career,  I developed the skills that made public speaking not only comfortable but truly enjoyable. \n\nSince many asked, me about how I do public speaking so smoothly and comfortably, in a future post, I will share more about how I built skills to deliver a 25-minute keynote speech with absolutely no notes.  \n\nMy talk at the University of California, Berkeley was about \"How to Build a Successful & Resistance Career.\"\n\nBelow, I shared 7 tips with the audience:\n\n1) Find & follow your passion: When you do, work becomes like play and it feels SO good. \n\n2) Ride a growing industry tide: AI wave could be one of the obvious ones. Without realizing it, I got to ride the mobile and wearable waves and they paid off significantly. \n\n3) Dare to fail: Without failure, you won't learn and won't make big leaps. \n\n4) Sprint your way to promotions and growth: See the stats I shared in the presentation, and it will explain it all. This is even more important for women than men.   \n\n5) Build a portfolio career: Apply rule #1 of investment (diversification) to your career. Build multiple revenue streams. \n\n6) Build your personal brand: That way people know your skills and strengths and they will bring you business and opportunities. \n\n7) Have a growth mindset: Our world is changing more rapidly than ever before. Learning new skills and re-inventing yourself is a must-have attitude. \n\nThe talk was a big hit with the audience. \n\nI thought it's timely to share this with the broader audience since it's a graduation season and many are embarking on their new journey.\n\nGraduation is a big milestone and such memorable day. I included pictures from my own graduation from the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business in 2006 and my students' graduation in 2017 -- when I used to teach Product Management at Haas.\n\nCongratulations to all the new graduates of 2024!  \n\nI wish you a career filled with success, some failure (as Jensen Huang wisely said: that's how you grow and make big leaps), and satisfaction. More importantly, though I wish you a fulfilling life that's filled with happiness, love, and impact.  \n\nA huge thank you to Charu Mehra, Jillian Geary, Briana Steele, Alyssa D'Cunha, P. Eng., and Katrina K. for the invitation to the Women in Leadership Conference and your support to make it a success. \n\nIt was great to meet Bonnie Hyun, Sangeeta Chakraborty, Christine Tao, Kathy Chou, Alena Taylor, Yannell Selman, Deana Thornton, and many other amazing speakers there. \n\nFor the full recording of my talk please see the link in the comment. \n\n#publicspeaking #2024graduates #graduationseason #graduation #womeninleadership",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 10mo ago": "Last week, I had a chance to attend the NYSE Tech Summit. 🤩 \n\nIt was a unique opportunity to hear from the public companies' CEOs, CTOs, and CIOs about their AI strategy as well as challenges and opportunities with AI.\n\nThere were a lot of great insights and learnings shared. \n\nOne thing stood out: Most executives shared that the pace of AI development is so rapid that what's relevant today may feel stale the next day. That's why they all are focused on a 6 month product strategy versus the traditional 12-24 month product strategy. \n\nThe motto was rapid testing, prototyping, and learning! 👏 👍 \n\nThat's the music to my ears as a product person with a laser focus on customers and the market.   \n\nHuge thank you to one and only, Bonnie Hyun, and the rest of the NYSE team for organizing such an informative and high-impact event together. \n\n#AI #aistrategy #aiinnovation",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 10mo ago": "Looking for a job? Are you getting exhausted in this tough market? \n\nLast night, Sam Wilkins of Riviera Partners and I shared insights on what we see in the market for #product and #AI roles, the candidate-market fit, and how to navigate the current market to land an offer.  \n\nWe had a talented and capable group of product leaders and executives joining us in person from all over the Bay Area. Thank you all for coming.\n\nA few takeaways from the evenings are below:\n\n✳ You and your skills are your product. \nYou need to \"bring\" yourself (just like a product) to the market, position yourself, and market yourself. The clearer you are about why your value proposition as a talent, the easier it is for the hiring manager or recruiter to connect the dots and hire you.  \n\n✳ Everyone has to learn AI no matter what's your function. \nIf you are in product you need to get started soon -- if you haven't already. And you don't need to be an engineer, data scientist, or mathematician to pick up AI. Just do it! ✔ Start today. \n\n✳ Network, network, network! Use referrals in your favor. \nFind people in your network or the company you plan to apply to who can bring your resume to the recruiter's or hiring manager's attention. Otherwise, your resume will be lost among 100s and 1000s of resumes coming in per each open role. \n\n✳ Be focused on your search. \nSpray and pray approach never works well, especially in this market. The best way to navigate your job search and ensure you increase your chances of landing an offer is to narrow down but go all in for those roles. \n\n✳ Be kind to yourself. \nIt's a tough market. Take some time to take care of yourself to recharge and rejuvenate. You don't want to be exhausted and out of battery in interviews.\n\n👉 If you want to be added to Raya's Talent Pool, please fill out our form (link in the comments). \n\n👉 For the link to the full recording of the event, see the comments. \n\nHuge thank you to Jessica H. & Li S. for making this possible. \n\n#recruitingtips #jobsearch #gethired #recruiting",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 10mo ago": "The recent Microsoft & LinkedIn #WorkTrendIndex data on AI’s impact on work has been fascinating. \n\nHere are a few highlights:  \n\n❇  AI impacted the job market dynamics:   \n* The majority (55%) of leaders are hiring are concerned about not enough talents in the market that are up-skilled with AI to fill their open roles.  \n\n* 66% of leaders say they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills.\n\n* 71% say they’d rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. This will give an edge to more junior candidates who are adopting AI rapidly. \n \n* In the US, LinkedIn studies show a 14% increase in job applications per role since last fall.\n\n❇ Professionals aren’t waiting for official guidance or training—they’re skilling up.\n* In the past 6 months, the use of LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals.\n* Employees across every age group from Boomers to Gen Z are bringing their own AI tools to work.\n\n❇ Leaders' #1 concern is cybersecurity and data privacy:\n* 78% of AI users bring their own AI tools to work (BYOAI)—it’s even more common at small and medium-sized companies (80%).  \n* 52% of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks.\n\n🤔 What do you think about these insights? What do you see in the market?

We want to work with Raya. 🤩 \n\n2️⃣ CEO of a Series B, AI company: I need to decide between two archetypes of VP of Products we have under consideration. I need your help to think through that decision before making an offer. \n\n3️⃣ Chief Growth Officer of a growth company: I need to hire top product talent for my team. I need Raya's expertise for that. \n\n4️⃣ CEO of Series B, health tech company: I have to decide between internal and external talents for a key leadership role. I seek your advice on how to think about this. \n\n5️⃣ CEO of a Series C company: Our Northstar and roadmap are not clear in the 2H of 2024 and beyond. We need your help to set the strategy forward for our company. \n\n🙏 Thanks to all those CEOs and Executives for trusting me and Raya as your sounding board! You know who you are and we appreciate you. 💙 💙 \n\nI have an 🚪 open-door/open-LinkedIn/open-email policy. I'm always happy to help anyone I can.  \n\nFeel free to reach out if you think you have similar problems about hiring, product strategy, AI strategy, enhancing your R&D processes, or anything in between.   \n\n#producthiring #productmanagement #gethired #hiretalent #productstrategy #CPO #CEO  #recruiting",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 10mo ago": "⏳\"Time\" is the most valuable commodity. 💸 💸💸   \n\nAnd spending time and energy \"learning new things\" 🤓 is the best investment you can make. 🏦\n\nWith those fundamental beliefs, I'll try to maximize the time I spend learning new skills or perspectives. \n\nOne behavioral change in the last 12 months helped me spend more time learning: I switched to listening to podcasts & audiobooks instead of music 💽 while working out (hiking, walking, skiing) -- yeah it may sound boring to some 🙈, but I love it! 😍 \n\nIn the last few weeks, I enjoyed listening to some awesome episodes from Lenny Rachitsky's podcasts with these thought-provoking guests: \n\n✳ Marty Cagan, the legendary product thought leader and Founder of Silicon Valley Product Group.\n \n✳ Emilie Gerber, Founder of Six Eastern PR agency, whom I had the opportunity of working with directly during my times at Cleo and have been in awe of her team's creativity and resourcefulness. \n\n✳ Andrew Bosworth, or Boz, the CTO of Meta.\n\nHere are the highlights of the conversations that stuck with me:\n \n📌 The concept of the \"product management theater\" that was introduced by Marty. In many companies, instead of having product managers who bring customer and market understanding to their work, they have project managers. These companies typically have more of a feature team versus empowered product teams that bring substantial value to the business.  \n\n📌 Emily shared a lot of great tactical PR tips. She's also been transparent about Six Eastern's pricing and what founders should expect when working with PR agencies. I highly recommend founders listen to this episode to learn about 1,2,3 of PR.  \n\n📌 Per Boz, at Meta, Zuck is still intimately involved not only in laying out the product vision and strategy but also in the weeds of product experience. This reminded me of Brian Chesky's approach at Airbnb.  \n\nBoz shared that many founders have regretted delegating too much of product decisions. He believes the most critical thing is for the founders and execs to recognize what things matter and sweat over them -- even if they feel small or too much in the weeds to others. That's the leadership approach at Meta that Zuck, Boz, and Chris Cox practice.  \n\n👉 If you've listened to these episodes what were your takeaways?\n\nAnd on another note: \n👉 When do you listen to your podcasts and audiobooks?\n👉 What do you listen to these days when working out? \n\nShare your thoughts in the comments. \n\n#productleadership #productmanagement #product",

Huge kudos to Samara Jaffe and all the organizers. \n\nHere are a few takeaways from the conference:\n\n1) Sarah Franklin, CEO of Lattice, was impressive to say the least! She and Cara Brennan Allamano did an amazing job discussing the importance of the CEO < > CPO relationship.  Sarah said the last few years have been bizarre! CEOs asked CPOs to hire at scale, then asked to lay off all those they had hired. They asked CPOs to send employees home from work and then asked them to bring all employees back to the office. They said we care about #DIEB; then they said we really don't! 🤔 🤣 😓 \n\n2) Liz (Schiffman) Dente, CPO at Priceline, beautifully put it: You can get your job done remotely, but you can't build your career remotely (and being at home). 💯 \n\n3) Sudhakar Ramakrishna, CEO of Soloarwind, said he invites everyone to come back to the office to get a break!  😜  To have a coffee with a colleague, to have a lunch out.... \n\n4) Josh Bersin, CEO of  The Josh Bersin Company, and Joel Hellermark, CEO & Co-Founder of Sana, described how feeding all the contents developed by Bersin to Sana's models enabled things that weren't possible before: searching large volume content, machine-created synthesis, and translations of contents to many languages. \n  \n5) Sarah Reynolds, CMO of HiBob, said 54% of Gen Zs reported that they are actively, not passively, disengaged from their work! Gen Zs are here to stay. What approaches do you apply to change the dynamic of your workforce?\n\nIt was fabulous to see/meet you Joe Ballou, Melisa Parks, Kyle Daquanna, Courtney M., Leslie Crowe, AJ Josephson, Cynthia Owyoung, Barb Cadigan, Jessie Lloyd Roberts, PHR, Jason Kershner, MSEd, CPCC, Eun-Mee Jeong Elle Meza, Anne Foreman, Stan Scott \n  \n#transform2024 #transformconference #hrcommunity #leadership",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 1yr ago": "Happy International Women’s Day! 💐 💐 💐 \n\nI’ve been blessed to have some of the best team members and leaders in my team being rockstar women! \n\nI've also been grateful in my career for having the support of many exceptional #female and #male leaders who mentored me, promoted me, lifted me up when I needed it, and empowered me. \n\nI would love to give back and do the same for other female (and male) friends, colleagues, and people in my network. \n\nEmpowering our next generation of female leaders, supporting them to become movers and shakers in their industry of choice, and celebrating their successes is what all of us, women and men, in the business and beyond should be doing. \n\nLast March, I mentored dozens of women who applied to the mentorship program that I announced on International Women’s Day.\n\nThis March, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business to hundreds of leaders and students. \n\nMy story resonated with many of them. The students still reach out to me with beautiful and profound notes -- which I treasure.  🎁 \n\nNext week, I’m hosting a Women in Power event in collaboration with the amazing team at Perkins Coie LLP to bring together women from different industries to celebrate the successes of these women, the glass ceilings they’ve broken, and the exceptional things they have achieved. \n\nWe are at capacity for that event, but in celebration of #internationalwomenday, we would like to give away a few seats to our broader network of women. \n\n👉 If you are interested in attending the event on 3/14 in San Francisco, please put a comment below. \n\n❓ What are the things you are doing to celebrate and empower women in your business or your network? Please share your stories in the comments. \n\n♻ Please reshare this post for the benefit of women in your network and broader exposure.\n\nNote: If the demand is high for the seats (which I would expect to be), we do a drawing by Monday and let the winners know (sorry the space is limited at this point). \n\n#internationalwomensday #internationalwomensday2024",

Get Used to Practicing on a Papaya…\n\nTeaching and training medical students about the uterus, fallopian tubes, pregnancy-related complications has become a political hot potato.\n\nResidency programs are having a difficult time ensuring students meet all the qualifications of becoming a competent doctor because many states have banned abortion procedures—and this means that medical students now can’t learn how to safely or competently perform standard women’s health procedures including miscarriages (because maybe it’s actually a planned abortion), or ectopic pregnancies (because it might appear to be a ruse for an abortion), normal vaginal deliveries (because the doctor hasn’t actually been trained in normal or abnormal deliveries)and elective abortions.\n\nAn overseeing body that provides accreditation to medical schools debated whether simulation-only modeling, a staple of medical education that is a precursor to direct care, would suffice for residents who were in states that now have outlawed abortion. And they even suggested using papayas instead of uteruses for practice.\n\nSo what happens to professionals when they are partly trained? They become partially qualified. \n\nAnd women’s health (and their pregnancies) gets compromised.",

None. For 6 days.\n\nAnd at the first opportunity, I pursued the news. Maybe it’s because I’ve not had access to any news and therefore hadn’t been able to read the usual borage of ‘pre-reads’ on a topic (like many articles about what might happen if Roe is dismantled), so I was shocked (anew) by all the depressing things that have happened over the last week:\n\nRoe overturned. (This will reap unsafe abortions and compromised women’s health in the coming year.) Shooting in Norway. Outbreak of Polio in the UK. Monkey pox on the rise. Outbreak of meningococcal disease in Florida. Chronic ailments from lack of sleep. Allowing e-cigarettes to be, once again, sold to children…\n\nAnd this is just the ‘week in health—‘ not any of the other news affecting our wallets, homes, environment or marriages.\n\nBut all this health (or illness news) does affect all corners of the healthcare marketplace—as an industry and for all medical professionals. \n\nAnd of course, this news affects all of us who are patients.\n\nAs an industry, expect to see big pivots in how—and which— ‘Women’s Health’ services are offered. There will be a re-scrambling to find ways to capture lost revenue and to keep patients who will want abortion services. Also expect to see growth in the Infectious Disease services. And expect for hospitals to begin dedicating floors or wings for those many contagious patients.\n\nAs professionals, besides expecting us to always be masked (due to the many, many infectious diseases)…providers can expect to become more secretive and selective about what they say to patients, family and administrators, since now, medical providers are targets of zealous individuals who wish harm to those who properly administer  the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nAnd for patients, expect less. Less convenience. Less services. Less access—not just for women. But for many services. Why? Because the healthcare industry will decrease overall services to weather the economy headwinds and staffing shortages that are predicted to stick around for another several years.\n\nThis is not a bright forecast. Quite the opposite: it seems we’ve regressed in our public health and in our human rights.\n\nOn a brighter note: Americans are inventive and strong. Those needing care of any kind, will find those who will administer that care. \n\nSeek and ye shall find.",

And such biases can affect who you hire, who you choose to work along side and, who you choose to fire when times at work get tough.\n\n‘Structural Ageism’ is describing the stereotyping of and discrimination against older adults.\n\nSuch structural ageism is no good for older workers who need to stay in the workforce, but it’s also very unhealthy for older individuals’ physical well-being, since studies show that if older people have a negative view of their aging, then in fact they age faster and ‘worse’ than those with healthy attitudes. \n\nSo if you are a younger person working alongside an older person, ask yourself, ‘What five words am I thinking right now about this person? And am I being negatively biased against them because of their age?’ \n\nBecause collectively, we create healthy or unhealthy attitudes and behaviors about our co-workers, that either help or hinder our collective well-being!",

Because of the big wave of sick anti-vaccinated Covid patients, hospitals in several states have run out of beds, meds and staff.\n\nAnd for doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and other staff, they’ve also run out of caring—fatigue and frustration now are settling in…and who can blame them?\n\nHospital officials say a high number of nurses and other medical staff, exhausted from 1½ years of stress, have quit and are unwilling to come back. That has made staffing, even more so than equipment in some cases, a barrier to care.\n\nSo, how to help? How to show you care about medical professionals? How to show you care about your neighbor? Get vaccinated. If you choose not to do that then show caring and respect by staying home when you get sick. \n\nDoctors, nurses and othe patients need those beds, meds and resources for other patients.",

In Alabama, all I.C.U. beds are occupied by the unvaccinated.\n\nIt is difficult to maintain standards of care for the sickest patients in hospitals where all or nearly all I.C.U. beds are occupied. \n\nSo for those who are vaccinated and have strokes, or heart attacks, or get into a car accident, or fall off a ladder, or have a diabetic crisis, or chemotherapeutic crisis and need emergency services and I.C.U.-level care, these patients are Out Of Luck. \n\nWhy? Because the unvaccinated are acting like privileged bratty children—they don’t want to take their medicine but expect to receive First Class medical care when they get sick. \n\nLike the 1% of our society who often assume they can break the rules and still move to the front of the line, the unvaccinated are behaving the same—and at the expense of the rest of us.\n\nI believe that hospitals are here to serve all of us and not just some of us. If the unvaccinated population leads to the occupation of our hospitals, then society needs to develop policies to re-set the balance so the 99% of the population can receive equal access to\nhealthcare.",

However, legislating individual choice is fundamentally anti-American and, frankly ridiculous.\n\nIf politicians (and those who support them) decide to hold whole communities legally culpable when women decide to end an unwanted pregnancy, then let’s be equally judgmental and harsh when it comes to ‘aiding and abetting’ smokers in their quest to buy cigarettes, drinkers in their purchasing of alcohol, gamblers who go to casinos, parents and adults who choose not to get the Covid-19 vaccine. \n\nIn my view, all of these people are culpable of some moral and ethical failing. So let’s create laws against those people too—and those who knowingly allows these ‘delinquents’ to live so egregiously. \n\nSee? These types of laws are ridiculous. Except for women who get pregnant and can’t access legal healthcare services.\n\nAbout one in six women are sexually assaulted every year or who choose to terminate their pregnancy. Having access to non-judgmental healthcare is required.\n\nSelected Excerpt:\n“… members at clinics, counselors, people who help pay for the procedure, even an Uber driver taking a patient to an abortion clinic are all potential defendants.”",

With the rise of at-home lab tests, devices that enable patients to collect their own blood samples without a clinic visit are becoming more relevant.\n\nI’m testing Tasso, Inc.’s blood collection device, which allows for capillary blood sampling at home. These technologies could play a key role in \n-remote monitoring\n- chronic disease management\n- and decentralized clinical trials.\n\nAs more health measurements move outside clinical settings, the question remains: How reliable are these methods compared to traditional blood draws?

Why don't we see them rounded up in ICE raids and put in handcuffs and shackles? \n\nIn 2024 1.44 million people showed up at our border seeking entry. 17,048 were arrested by border agents because they were criminals. The biggest reason was that they had attempted to cross illegally before. The second biggest reason? Drunk driving convictions. 29 for murder and 221 for sexual offenses.  We absolutely shouldn't be letting people into the country who are criminals but all the rhetoric that they are \"murderers and rapists\" is important to understand. The president always ties this accusation to people who aren't white. \n\nI am grateful to the border agents who apprehend criminals and stop them from entering the country. I also like to know the truth and when I'm\nbeing lied to. \n\nData also shows communities with higher levels of immigrants actually have less crime.

Some of these children's parents had been killed by the Russian military. The Russian State Duma has initiated legislation to formalize the \"adoption\" of these children.\n\nAfter the Russian withdrawal from areas north of Kyiv, there was \"a mounting body of evidence\" of rape, torture and summary killings by Russian forces inflicted upon Ukrainian civilians, including gang rapes committed at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children.\n\nUN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine verified 74 attacks on medical facilities, 61 of them in Government-controlled territory (e.g. air strikes on hospitals in Izium, Mariupol, Ovruch, Volnovakha and Vuhledar), nine occurring in territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups, and four in contested settlements. Six perinatal centres, maternity hospitals, and ten children's hospitals had been hit, resulting in the complete destruction of two children's hospitals and one perinatal hospital.\n\nOn 11 March 2022, Russia-affiliated forces attacked a care house with heavy weapons while 71 patients with disabilities and 15 members of staff were still inside. A fire broke out and approximately fifty people died. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office announced war crimes charges against Russia for the attack.\n\nAs of 30 May 2023, WHO has verified 1,004 attacks on medical facilities in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion, resulting in at least 101 deaths among health workers and patients, and many injuries. \n\nA journalist was held captive for nine days and subjected to electric shocks, beatings with an iron bar and a mock execution. Reporters Without Borders stated that Russian forces had threatened, kidnapped, detained and tortured several Ukrainian journalists in the occupied territories.\n\n A doctor who treated victims of torture in the region reported: \"Some of the worst were burn marks on genitals, a gunshot wound to the head of a girl who was raped, and burns from iron on a patient's back and stomach. The patient told me two wires from a car battery were attached to his groin and he was told to stand on a wet rag\".\n\nAccording to the witnesses, at least eight civilians were held in a basement of a train station, where they were tortured, starved, subject to mock executions, forced to sit in their own excrement, electrocuted, stripped, and threatened with rape and genital mutilation. At least one prisoner was beaten to death by Russian guards who told the prisoners \"All Ukrainians must die\". \n\nSenator John McCain called Putin a thug and said “I think it’s very clear that Russian ambitions are to restore the old Russian empire, Not the Soviet Union, but the Russian empire.”\n\nLook up what countries the Russian empire included, know why Europe has an interest in supporting Ukraine. 🇺🇦 \n\nPhoto from the New York Times",

I am grateful that awareness, research and solutions to support caregivers has grown dramatically. When I started my professional patient advocacy business, there was just one Gallup study on the impact caring for a loved one had on the physical and mental health of family members who provided that care.\n\nThe budget that was approved last night by all Republicans in congress except one from Kentucky, will hurt caregivers and patients. \n\nCuts to Medicaid are most likely imminent. \n\nDid you know that more than 60% of nursing home residents are on Medicaid? Cuts mean nursing homes lose money and will have to make cuts to staff and services or even deny people on Medicaid. Where will senior citizens who have minimal financial resources go? Who is going to quit their job to provide round the clock care to their parent?\n\n56% of children with disabilities are on Medicaid and/or SSI in America. These  are children who were born with problems like cardiac anomalies, severe developmental delays, were born prematurely, have cancer or were victims of accidents including gun violence. How will they get their medicine? Who will quit their job to care for them? How will their parents keep a roof over their head? \n\nI remember working in the pediatric ICU before the affordable care act. I cared for children who had met their $1 million lifetime insurance maximum within their first week of life because they were born with a heart defect. This meant no more coverage.  I saw the terror parents experienced wondering what they would do to save their child when insurance no longer would pay for their care. Many saw their homes go into foreclosure, cars repossessed but they qualified for Medicaid so at least their child had a chance to survive. I saw this with my own eyes. I listened to the families ask where help was as they faced this reality. \n\nPeople will go without life saving medicine and procedures. People will not have food and will have no choice but to cut back or quit their jobs so someone they love can survive. \n\nCaregivers are already in crisis, overextended, facing physical illness themselves as a result of the demands they face. \n\nI don't think many understand the impact on the horizon. If you know someone who is caring for a loved one, take a moment to give them support and encouragement. Let them know you understand how challenging things are.

Thirteen riders including Mulholland, left on two Greyhound buses en route to New Orleans from Washington, D.C.\n\nAnniston, Alabama was the most dangerous of all towns where the riders stopped. On Mother's Day, the two buses arrived in Anniston and were set on fire. Churchgoers and their children were reportedly watching as the riders attempted to escape the flames of the bus, only to be beaten by the townspeople until the police stopped the chaos. After this event, many thought they saw the end of the Freedom Rides. Instead, a call was made to Mulholland in D.C. and Diane Nash, asking for more riders.\n\nMulholland, along with Stokely Carmichael (the activist and later SNCC chairman, who would later be known as Kwame Turre), Hank Thomas, and many others, took a different freedom ride. The group took a plane to New Orleans, then rode on the Illinois Central train to Jackson, Mississippi, with members of the Congress of Racial Equality.\nAfter the new group of Freedom Riders were arrested for refusing to leave a bus waiting area in Jackson, Mulholland and others were put inside a paddy wagon and taken to Parchman Penitentiary in Mississippi. At the time, June 1961, Mulholland was 19, and she refused to pay bail.\n\nMulholland participated in the May 28, 1963 sit-in to protest racial segregation at the lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store in downtown Jackson. She was one of 14 activists. They  were beaten, smeared with condiments, and berated. The crowd yelled at the students, screaming the phrase \"communist\" at them constantly. One man pointed out of the crowd to Mulholland, calling her a \"white nigger\".\nAround the time Mulholland arrived at Woolworth's, Tougaloo student Memphis Norman had been dragged to the floor by former police officer Benny Oliver, who wore tennis shoes, and was being kicked repeatedly. Moody had been thrown against the counter. Around this time, Mulholland noticed a man walk past Moody with a knife and called out, \"Annie, he's got a knife.\" She then walked to the counter and sat down next to Moody and Lewis. People started to yell slurs such as \"traitor,\" \"communist,\" \"black bitch,\" and \"white nigger.\" \n\nMulholland was lifted by her waist by one man and Moody was lifted from her stool by two high school boys. Both of the girls were dragged by their hair out of the store.\n\nDue to her actions as an activist participating in at least three dozen sit-ins, not only was she disowned by her family, but she was also hunted by the Klan. Mulholland's mother believed she had been \"sucked up into a cult\", while her father was ultimately concerned about her safety.\n\nMulholland has reportedly said in recent years that \"sometimes people need to put down their phones and get in the streets.\"",

    "Michelle Chaffee's post 3w ago": "As a cancer survivor, the federal cuts made by Trump at the recommendation of Musk directly impacts advancements made to detect, treat and prevent many, many diseases including ovarian cancer which is already grossly underfunded. \n\nI am all for a lean budget and I agree there is waste and fraud to some degree at the federal level. When I was a medical investigator I saw first hand how many physicians in America overcharge, lie about time spent with a patient and even bill Medicare for services they didn't ever provide. This is wrong and should be stopped.\n\nTo effectively identify the root cause of fraud and abuse and hold accountable those who are gaming the system, takes time. Mass firings and freezing or completely cutting funds without taking the time to actually identify the problem is not only stupid, it causes harm. \n\nThis approach indicates a reason other than what we are being told. Either the individuals doing this are the antithesis of \"genius\" in matters of business and budgets or they have a different agenda entirely. I'll leave that contemplation up to you but what I do know is this isn't good for the citizens of the United States. \n\nPeople who do this research are not a dime a dozen. They aren't easily replaceable and stopping research abruptly isn't easily picked up where it left off when it's realized at some point this was a very unpopular and damaging action. \n\nIf millions and billions of dollars have been misappropriated as Elon Musk and Trump state, who are the perpetrators? Where are the charges? These are tax payer dollars. If this is happening, I want those individuals held accountable. \n\nIt makes it hard to swallow the reasons they provide.\n\nMeanwhile, millionaires and billionaires still have their tax breaks. 💰💵\n\nIn the meantime, we can make donations to private research initiatives. MOCA Minnesota Ovarian Cancer Alliance is one of the largest donors in the country to research to prevent and treat ovarian cancer. Please consider a donation. 🔬🩵\n\nI, along with millions of women and people who love and fear losing them to this deadly disease, thank you. 🙏🏻",

    "Michelle Chaffee's post 1mo ago": "Like many from my generation, I have come to realize that the America I grew up thinking I knew was an existence not everyone experienced. In fact, it has only been within the past five years that I have seen first-hand how different this country is for African Americans and anyone who speaks out about the racism, oppression and blatant lack of value that is too often exhibited by far too many. \n\nI struggle with wondering whether or not my inability to stay quiet about what I see is out of a desire to ease the suffering of others or a selfish pursuit. Selfish because it bothers me so much to know others suffer and are marginalized and that whether I wanted to or not, I have benefitted from a system based in hatred and a desire for power. I want that to stop. I despise it.\n\nI want to live in a country where all are safe and all children are treated as precious because they exist and because they represent our future. A country where it is shameful for any citizen to be starving, without shelter or unable to get medicine or care when we have abundant resources and capabilities. A place where integrity and empathy are valued above money and power.\n\nWhat I want has not been the history of America. There have been glorious moments of this vision, times when we were a symbol of peace and democracy but we took those for granted and told ourselves that IS what we are and will always be. \n\nThe truth is that we were barbarians from the moment we landed on the shores of this nation. We were killers and thieves. We lied and manipulated telling ourselves it was in the name of progress when it was really power. One of my own ancestors was the Chief of Staff of the Army and played a crucial role in the Indian Wars, killing Native Americans across the plains and in Texas and Arizona. He was rewarded for the genocidal actions he carried out. This is the truth and many Americans if honest with themselves, would grapple with similar realizations.\n\nSome strived to do better. knowing the killing and oppression were wrong and  took action to change the trajectory. They named the truth because they wanted a nation that was better. They had a vision for what it could be and they came together. There was still much to be done but hope, one day America would get there. We can't forget these victories.\n\nNow, we have gone backwards. How did we let this happen? Some of us saw the danger we were in but hoped enough would choose a path to get things back on track. \n\nI am so sorry for our allies around the globe.  I am sorry that the likelihood of nuclear proliferation seems higher than it has been in my lifetime and I am sorry for the ungodly celebration of sexism, racism, homophobia, intolerance, and cruelty that is on display in American. \n\nPlease remember how many of us are disgusted and horrified. We are doing what we can to save what is still good and make a nation better than it has ever been. Some of us still hope. Please don't give up on us.\n#america #hope",

    "Michelle Chaffee's post 1mo ago": "Racism, patriarchy and privilege are \"theories?\"\n\nThe U.S. Naval Academy teachers can no longer teach or speak of these things. \n\nI'd like to see some evidence to support the theory that completely ignoring these things existed, makes them no longer an issue. There is plenty of evidence showing us the outcomes of this attempt to suppress knowledge. \n\nThe world learns about the history of the U.S. and systemic racism, oppression of women and other minorities are a part of that history. How strong will America be when we know less about our history than our enemies or allies? \n\nWhat's next? Who or what belief will be the target? Certain religions? What other thoughts will not be allowed to be spoken about? \n\nThere is no way you can tell yourself this is normal or not something to be feared. This is a blatant attack on our freedom and an effort to silence truth. \n\nIf you read this and other similar posts or articles and agree it is wrong but hesitate to comment, like or repost because you're afraid of what may happen if you do, that is the proof our nation as we have known it, has changed.  The indication that the gratitude we felt in the past when hearing of other people around the world being oppressed and that we Americans had freedom to speak and believe what we we wanted, may be no more. \n\n\"That would never happen here\" is happening now.  \n\nThis order came from President Trump. There was no vote anywhere to make this change. If we now have a president wielding this power what can happen when we have another leader? What are their personal beliefs or who is giving them enough money to convince them to make us do what they want? \n\nThese actions are serious. This isn't an action that is at all aligned with the democracy we have known and taken for granted. That so many have fought and died for. \n\nFaculty at the United States Naval Academy have been told they cannot teach about or even mention the racism and oppression that is simply a part of the history of our nation. \n\nThe email by Provost Samara Firebaugh instructs faculty to search course materials for words like “diversity,” “minority,” “belonging,” “bias,” “representation,” and “oppression.”\n\n“Do not use materials that can be interpreted to assign blame to generalized groups for enduring social conditions, particularly discrimination or inequality,” Firebaugh said in the email message. “Do not employ readings or other materials that promote the concepts of ‘gender ideology,’ ‘divisive concepts,’ ‘race or sex stereotyping,’ and ‘race or sex scapegoating,’ including critical race theory, intersectionality, privilege, patriarchy or other such theories.”",

He is one of many, unfortunately, who voice similar sentiments. \n\nI suppose one of the good things about some of the statements made here is that you see who people really are. This is good to know when you're networking, collaborating and hoping to make business connections with people. \n\nFor the record, my daughter is and always has been exceptional. Anyone who has ever met her from the time she could barely walk, would attest to that. Every single American is blessed to have my child, who had many options presented to her, serving them and sacrificing for their right to freely speak 🐂💩.\n\nOf course anyone who isn't blindly sexist knows every man isn't smarter than my daughter or any woman. What is astounding is the open, blatant, unflinching and downright gleeful manner these insults are publicly hurled. \n\nI hoped the world would be better for my daughters than what I experienced. I hoped they wouldn't have to fight as hard to be seen and valued for their intelligence, tenacity, integrity and capability. I truly didn't imagine it would be this much worse and that I'd be fighting even harder for them and for me. #DEI #USNA #Marines #USmilitary",

What’s your tip for driving effective meetings?\n\nMeetings should serve one of these 3 purposes: decide, brainstorm, inform.\n\nDecide meetings are typically tied with an inform component. They’re the most expensive meetings of the three as senior stakeholders are usually involved. Pro-tip: preread with outlined recommendations is a must. \n\nBrainstorm meetings typically are needed to get to the decide stage. Responsible individuals are brought together to develop a proposal or set of recommendations. Pro-tip: agenda of discussion points and designated facilitator to capture AIs is a must. \n\nInform meetings should be brief and succinct. Ideally, these are kept to a minimum unless they’re combined with a decision-making or brainstorming component. Pro-tip: outside of a crisis or warroom, keep inform meetings to a minimum. Always track AIs from these meetings to drive delivery and accountability.\n\n#meetings #leadership",

Top volunteering activities food collection and distribution, fundraising, and tutoring.\n\nA common question I often get is how and when do you start giving back. Where do you start? Do nonprofits and charities prefer donations or volunteers? Should you focus on local or national organization?\n\nLike many things in life and work, it depends. I always recommend starting with why you want to give back. Focus on the types of causes you are passionate about before you narrow down on the how. Start small and build up with short-term commitments like a weekend volunteer events. Then go deeper with long-term commitments over the span of several month. If volunteering time is a challenge, consider reading about nonprofits that focus on causes you care about to donate and amplify their work. \n\nAn observation I’ve seen with nonprofits I am apart with is the social aspect of volunteering. Consider doing it with a group of friends or check out if your company is hosting/sponsoring any local volunteering opportunities. \n\nIf you plan to make a donation, do some research to see if your company runs any giving or matching program. Especially during this time of the year and on Giving Tuesday, which lands on November 29th this year. For example, Airbnb provides employees with paid volunteer time and will double match employee donations during this year’s Giving Tuesday. And Google runs an annual Holiday Giving program that enables Googlers to dedicate donation waivers to nonprofits of their choice.\n\nNo matter how you choose to give back, remember that your way of paying forward is uniquely your own. Impact is measured in quality and intent. \n\nI hope you’ll join me in giving back in your very own way this coming holiday season. Share how you’re planning to give back this year below. I’ll start with my very own in the comment. \n\n#community #nonprofits #givingtuesday",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1mo ago": "Back in the mid-1990s, while working at a global ad agency (my first “real” job), I was on a team developing a TV and print campaign for our client’s new overnight package delivery service. \n\nThe challenge: visually communicate speed in a creative and memorable way (all within the typical 30 second time limit of a TV commercial).\n\nDuring a brainstorming session, I threw out an idea—what if we showed a man rapidly carving an ice sculpture? The inspiration came from elaborate banquets I had attended in Taiwan, where ice sculptures were a centerpiece. It felt fresh, unexpected, and visually striking.\n\nA few weeks later, the creative director presented his storyboards, and there it was: a man carving a giant ice sculpture with a chainsaw. He even gave the character my Chinese name at the time, Wang Taiping—a name I later changed after learning it was hilariously outdated. \n\nThe team loved it. The client loved it. And the creative director basked in the glow of the client’s approval—while failing to acknowledge my contribution to the concept. \n\nThe client was so invested in the idea they even hired Jackie Chan, the popular actor who famously does his own stunts, to play the part of the sculptor. \n\nSoon, I found myself in an industrial section of Hong Kong, watching the production crew bring my idea to life.\n\nLessons Learned:\n\n✅ Good ideas don’t require a lot of “experience”. What seemed like a throwaway idea in a free-thinking session turned into the winning concept. Never hold back an idea just because it feels unconventional—or because you think you’re too young. I was just 25 at the time.\n\n✅ Creativity often originates from personal experience. Observing something as simple as banquet ice sculptures in Taiwan led to an idea that shaped a regional ad campaign. Inspiration is everywhere—pay attention and take lots of notes.\n\n✅ Great ideas don’t just stay on paper. The best ones can make it all the way to production, proving that creativity, when combined with execution, can be transformed into reality. \n\nBut there’s one more lesson that stuck with me.\n\nSure, it bothered me when our creative director took my idea as his.  \n\nBut from that early career experience, I learned a valuable lesson that guided me as I later moved into decision-making and management roles. \n\nWhen a colleague develops an idea or proposes a plan that has a positive impact, be sure to publicly—and privately—recognize their contributions—no matter their age. They could be junior, or they could be older and more experienced. \n\nIt’s not just the right thing to do—it builds better teams, stronger ideas, and lasting respect.\n\n❓Have you ever had someone take credit for your idea at work? How did you handle it? I’d love to read about it in the comments. \n\n…\n\n(The opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.)\n\nImage: DALL-E\n\n#leadershiplessons #inspiringstories",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 11mo ago": "I just got back from a trip to Shanghai where we held our annual “China Week” conference for clients.  \n\nHaving lived in Shanghai with my wife and two young kids for five years back in 2006-2011, returning to this remarkable city felt like coming back home. \n\nShanghai is Shanghai. It’s both representative of the rest of the “new China” but also an outlier of sorts. Unique, with its cosmopolitan flair and long history as a commercial headquarters for foreign companies and a place that was carved up and claimed by foreign powers from the West and Asia alike. \n\nShanghai is an enormously fun city. My family and I had a lot of good times when we lived there and made some great friends. \n\nWhile the pandemic has not been forgotten, of course, it does feel very much like the city has returned to normal. \n\nImmigration lines at the airport are one of the first indicators I look at as a gauge of the economic temperature. They were very long this time, much longer than a year ago, and certainly longer than January 2020, when the pandemic was taking hold in the country and travel was quickly cut off. \n\nA recent report by my colleague Daniel Zipser shows that domestic travel has bounced back and now exceeds pre-COVID levels. International travel is rising month by month and is rapidly approaching pre-pandemic levels. A recent survey by my firm shows international travel as the top item that Chinese consumers plan to increase their spending on in the next few months. \n\nOn the roads you can’t help but see electric vehicles everywhere. While local brands like BYD, XPeng, and NIO are common, there are lots of Teslas as well. In fact, as recent data from my colleague’s report shows, local brands have captured 84.5% of the EV market, which grew by a whopping 37% in 2023. Tesla has managed to carve out an impressive 7.8% share. EVs now make up 35.6% of China’s overall market of 21.7 million cars. \n\nThe pandemic, economic uncertainty, lagging consumer confidence, and a collapsed property market have led Chinese consumers to sock away a lot more of their cash over the last few years, pushing the savings rate to 31.7%, well above the 4% that American consumers save. \n\nThe 56 trillion in additional renminbi they’ve stored away in their bank accounts between 2020 and 2023, if unleashed, could have an enormous impact on domestic consumption as well as overseas spending by Chinese travelers. \n\nIn fact, the early travelers who are heading to Japan, Singapore, Paris, and Milan have already been spending ferociously, with per traveler spending up by the double digits in these destinations.\n\nChina has its challenges. But it’s also continuing to do what it’s been focusing on for the past few decades: Innovating, investing, manufacturing, and spending. \n\nAnd they’re doing it all at their typical “China speed”, which is something to marvel at. \n\n(There’s a link to the full report in the comments)\n\n#china #shanghai #economy",

With its leafy streets and European-style architecture, it’s known as the “Paris of the East.”\n\n“Macaron!” My colleague lit up instantly and invited me to look at his camera roll on his phone. \n\nHe opened a photo of boxes of multi-colored macarons and proudly declared he made them himself. \n\nHe continued to swipe through several more photos of his incredible confectionary creations.\n\n“Did you attend culinary school?” I asked in awe. \n\n“No, I just enjoy making these on the weekend for my family. My three kids love to eat desserts. I spend hours making these every weekend. I enjoy it.”\n\n“Seriously, you could easily open a shop that rivals any of the best patisserie’s in the city…like Paul (the French pastry chain)!”, thinking he would feel flattered.\n\nHe rolled his eyes. “I have high standards.”\n\nHere is a guy who spends long hours and several days away from home each month advising some of the world’s biggest companies on their most complicated operational issues. \n\nYet he still manages to find the time (and energy!) to bake pastries for his young family on the weekend. \n\nPastries that look like a lemon on the outside, but when sliced in half reveals that it’s a cake instead, with fruit, jellies, and other delicacies inside. \n\nApple tarts with dozens of thin apple slices arrayed with geometric symmetry.\n\nCream puffs that ooze liquid caramel from the center. \n\nSure, most of us have hobbies. He’s not the only one. I’m sure you do too. \n\nWhat surprised me most was not that—jaw-droppingly impressive as his talent is.\n\nWhat surprised me is the assumption I had made about him. \n\nHow I had judged him prior to knowing about his pastry making skills. \n\nI had never met him before, so of course I wouldn’t know. \n\nI based my understanding of him on what little I did know about him—that he is one of our firm’s experts on complex digital transformations. \n\nBut I knew nothing else about him. \n\nThe take-away for me?\n\nTemper your judgments and assumptions about other people.\n\nTry to find more opportunities to ask about what people are interested in. \n\nWhat they’re passionate about. \n\nWhat they spend hours on the weekend doing for the sake of their family, or just for themselves. \n\nWhat lights them up. \n\nAnd remind myself what makes me feel the same way—and devote more time to doing that. \n\n#inspiration",

He’s also the founder of TechMoat Consulting, a boutique digital advisory firm. \n\nI’ve known Jeff for the past decade, since we first collaborated on one of his bestselling books. \n\nHe’s incredibly insightful about all things digital, enormously knowledgeable about China, he’s a deep thinker and captivating speaker, and I always learn something from him. \n\nI’ll be sharing my entire conversation with Jeff on LinkedIn and my Substack later this weekend but wanted to first share this excerpt from our illuminating conversation. I may share more short clips like this as well. \n\nIf you enjoyed watching this please let me know and reach out and connect or follow me on LinkedIn. \n\nStay tuned!\n\n#writing #digitalmarketing #generativeai",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1yr ago": "LinkedIn is rolling out a new AI-powered feature that will automate the content writing process. Some of the most regular content creators are concerned that this will lead to an explosion of generic, bot-like content.\n\nI agree the threat of this occurring is very real, and it is somewhat concerning and, frankly, a bit depressing. \n\nBut let's face it: content creators here are already using ChatGPT and other tools to help them generate content, whether you notice it or not. AI-generated, or AI-facilitated, content creation on LinkedIn is not going away.\n\nSo what should we do? How can we retain the human element in the creative process? Will we--we humans that is--continue to even matter?\n\nI think so, and my friend Amy Blaschka would agree. \n\nBack in July 2021, when I interviewed her for my podcast, Write With Impact, well before ChatGPT turned the world upside down, she had some insightful observations about the need to retain your humanity when writing on LinkedIn.\n\n(I've transcribed her comments in case you don't have time to watch the clip, but I'd encourage you to watch it if you do).\n\n❓ What do you think? I would love to read your thoughts in the comments to this post. Let's discuss and debate!\n\n- - - - - -\n\n\"I think there is this misperception that on social media, you have to just share all the wins and you have to have what I call the 'Instagram worthy, curated content.' \n\nIt’s like there’s only the good stuff, because God forbid you share anything that would portray you as someone who's made a mistake or had a supposed failure.\n\nBut the opposite is true. People respond to humans, to imperfect people. And when you're a leader, of course you've made mistakes. Everybody has stumbled. \n\nBut the important thing is, when you're sharing about that, is to say, you know, this happened, but this is how I found my way out.\n\nAnd something like that will endear you to other people; they'll also come to see you as human. \n\nYou leave them with something that they connect better with, because you're not somebody that's up on a pedestal imparting your wisdom.\n\nThat genuineness really translates well across social media, because we both know there are a lot of people that do the opposite. \n\nAnd sorry, you're going to alienate people, or they're going to keep scrolling. \n\nI would personally much rather read and share something that is real world, real life.\"\n\n\n- - - - - - - -\nYou should follow Amy, subscribe to her LinkedIn newsletter, Momentum, and subscribe to her Substack, Illuminate Me (links in the comments).\n\nAnd please reach out and connect with me for more writing tips and in-depth conversations with award-winning writers and content creators!\n\n#generativeai #contentcreator #humanconnection",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1yr ago": "You know how you can sense when a piece of writing flows smoothly from one sentence to the next? How do writers do this?\n\nAccording to one definition, \"writing flow refers to the pace, cadence, or rhythm of a piece of writing. Good writing flow allows a reader to ease into the text without expending much mental energy—it has a natural feel that makes reading a breeze. Texts without good flow feel choppy and lack cohesion.\" (Masterclass)\n\nSmoother, more rhythmic writing...\n\n...creates an enjoyable reading experience.\n\n...engages the reader and holds their attention.\n\n...communicates ideas more clearly and with more impact.\n\n...projects professionalism and builds credibility.\n\nIn this quick guide, I've assembled 6 tips (with brief examples and a few quotes from famous authors sprinkled in for inspiration) to help you improve the sense of flow in your writing.\n\nHere they are:\n\nTip 1️⃣ : Vary Sentence Structure\nCombine simple, compound, and complex sentences to create a more dynamic and engaging rhythm that holds your reader’s attention.\n\nTip 2️⃣ : Play with Sentence Length\nAlternate between short sentences to create tension or add emphasis, and longer sentences to provide detail and nuance.\n\nTip 3️⃣ : Use Transitions Wisely\nConnect your ideas seamlessly with transition words and phrases. They're the essential link between sentences and paragraphs, and guide your reader through your narrative.\n\nTip 4️⃣ : Embrace Active Voice\nReplace passive constructions with active ones to inject energy and forward momentum into your prose.\n\nTip 5️⃣ : Be Mindful of Parallelism\nWhen writing lists or comparing items, ensure that the grammatical structure is consistent. This creates a sense of harmony and cohesion in your writing.\n\nTip 6️⃣ : Read Aloud\nSometimes, the best way to identify problems with flow is to read your writing aloud. This helps you spot awkward phrasing, repetition, or other inconsistencies that may affect its rhythm and flow.\n\n\n❓ How do you improve the sense of flow in your writing? Please share your tips and techniques in the comments.👇\n\n\n✍ For more writing tips and to watch or listen to in-depth conversations with award-winning writers, please follow or connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\n#writing #writingtips #writinglife",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1yr ago": "After a 60-year career, this bestselling author of more than 25 novels still finds this part of the writing process “pure torture.”\n\nThese are the words Judy Blume, author of pre-teen classics such as “Are You There God, It’s Me Margaret?”, “Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,” and “Forever”, uses to describe how she feels about writing the first draft:\n\n“My process is a strange one, and the way that I explain it to kids — maybe it’s not so strange, maybe I just think it’s strange — the first draft for me is pure torture. There’s no question about that.\n\nI had so much inside me, I had so much creative energy, and I needed to let it out so badly, so the first few books just poured out. But that was then. \n\nAnd for many, many, many, many years now, I have found first drafts to be torture. Getting something out. \n\nOnce I have a first draft out, then I like it. I like the rewriting. I’m a reviser, more than a first draft writer…And I go through at least five drafts.”\n\n\nI’m not a writer or editor of fiction, but I find Blume’s honest confession (note how she says “pure torture” so emphatically, and twice, in this video clip) very encouraging and affirming of my own anxiety around producing the first draft of whatever I’m working on.\n\nAs a pre-teen boy, I was a huge fan of Blume’s searingly honest, funny, and highly relatable books — including the ones she wrote for pre-teen girls — and I’ve enjoyed watching my own kids get hooked on her books. \n\nOne of her most popular books, “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” was released as a major movie production last week, and a new documentary about her life and work is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe 85-year-young Blume, who now lives in Key West, where she runs a non-profit book store that has a special section for banned books, has been giving a number of interviews recently, including an excellent conversation with Terry Gross of NPR, which I recommend you check out (link in the comments).\n\n❓How do you feel about writing the first draft?

This was Bill Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nAs Jobs explains in this rare video clip, Bill laughed, and then not only gave him the spare parts he asked for, he gave him a summer internship at the Hewlett-Packard factory on the very assembly line that built them. \n\nThe lesson Jobs took away from that formative experience: if you want to get ahead in life or at work, you need to learn to ask for what you want. \n\n“Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask, and that’s what separates sometimes the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. \n\nYou’ve gotta act, and you’ve gotta be willing to fail, you’ve gotta be willing to crash and burn, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. \n\nIf you’re afraid of failing you won’t get very far.”\n\nSince I first discovered this rare interview with Steve Jobs, I’ve been profoundly impressed by the message he shares. \n\nIt’s a message I’ve tried to instill in my own children as they navigate school and the working world, and it’s a message I sometimes remind myself of. \n\n❔ What do you think? How does Jobs’ message resonate with you? Share your thoughts in the comments. \n\n#stevejobs #inspiration #successmindset",

It's not. It's all perspiration, you know, and judgment.\n\nAnd you're never satisfied with what you do. About every page you write is perhaps thrown away three or four times.\n\nThere's a place outside my little work hut where that white brick wall is blackened, where the bonfire takes place about every week. I have a wastepaper basket beside me which is three to four-foot high and that gets filled.\n\nThere's a tremendous lot of work involved at the desk, working it out, seeing which way to go, writing the first page, and rewriting it about ten times.\n\nAnd while you're rewriting that first page, the rest of it is subconsciously beginning to build in your mind bit by bit.”\n\n#ai #writing #censorship",

The city was only just starting to take-off. Xintiandi wasn’t built yet, and Pudong didn’t have its striking skyline yet either. The contrast between then and now is stark. \n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, I spent 5 years living in this dynamic city with my young kids. My daughter learned to walk and talk here, my son fell in love with soccer.

(Link to my article in the comments)\n\nI had just opened my NY Times app this evening in Taipei to catch up on the news when I saw the live stream of NASA’s event to announce the four astronauts on Artemis II, the next mission to circle the moon scheduled for late 2024. \n\nWhen I heard NASA administrator Bill Nelson announce Reid as the Commander of the mission, I was overwhelmed with surprise and excitement and immediately congratulated him through an email to his brother. \n\nReid was chief astronaut at NASA, a position he deliberately stepped down from so he could be eligible to lead this mission, rather than just assign other astronauts to it. \n\nIn this time of uncertainty and conflict in the world, it’s inspiring to see that we are continuing the mission that President John F. Kennedy announced in his historic speech more than 60 years ago that set the US on a path toward the moon and space travel. \n\nCongratulations to Commander Wiseman and the entire crew of Artemis II !\n\n#spacenews #spaceexploration #moonshot",

Jane is the Director of the Writing Center at Harvard University, where she’s been teaching undergraduate and graduate students how to become better writers for nearly 23 years.\n\nWhen ChatGPT was first released to the public in December, she shared her initial impressions on Writing Hacks, her Substack newsletter, published opeds in the Boston Globe, and was interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning. So, to help me parse through this phenomenon, I invited Jane for a conversation about ChatGPT on my podcast, Write With Impact. \n\nAs an educator, Jane is concerned about the impact this technology will have on students’ ability—and patience—to work through the process of learning how to write, a process she sees as critical to their ability to discover and articulate their own ideas on the subjects they are learning. \n\nAfter exploring the impact of ChatGPT on the process of learning how to write, Jane shares a few practical writing tips drawing on her two decades of experience teaching thousands of students at Harvard, as well as her work coaching corporate clients.\n\nShe talks about cutting repetitive language, removing words that dilute the impact of your message, applying the 80-20 rule to using the passive voice, and eliminating what she calls “fake transitions”.\n\n❓ How do you think ChatGPT will change the way we write--and learn to write?

They have your back during tough times.\nExceptional leaders are the ones who stand up for you and support you during your most challenging moments.\n\n6.

She's also published opeds in the Boston Globe on the topic, and she's explored the topic on her Substack, \"Writing Hacks.\"\n\nI sat down with Jane for the latest episode of Write With Impact to get her take on how ChatGPT and generative AI might impact the way we write--and how we learn to write.\n\nHere's an 8-minute excerpt from my one-hour conversation that I'll be sharing on my Write With Impact newsletter on LinkedIn this week. (Be sure to hit the 'subscribe' button to get the full episode once I release it.  Visit my profile or click the link in the comments.)\n\nHere's Jane:\n\n\"A useful way that I’ve found to explain my concern about this, and to think about my concern, is the difference between process and product. \nChatGPT creates a written product. You say to it, \"write me a college paper,\" “write me some real estate listings,” whatever it is that you’re doing in your field, and out it comes. It’s a complete product. \n\nSo that's one way of thinking about it. This machine can do our writing for us.\n\nBut when you teach writing, you're not really in search of a product, you're in search of a thought process. For my students, I’m much less interested in what the product is--we can get a product from anywhere. \n\nWhat I’m interested in is, what are they interested in, what kinds of questions do they have, and how does the process of writing an answer to a question help you figure out what you think. And that's not what ChatGPT is designed to do. It's a product.\n\nI think for educators, the concern—and it’s a very reasonable and real concern—is if what we're really trying to do is teach critical thinking, and help our students become people who understand the world, know what they think, know what they want to ask questions about, it's hard to imagine that this chatbot is the way to achieve that goal. \n\nAnd yet it’s there, and it’s easily accessible, and people are using it, so now we have to figure out how we co-exist with this technology.\"\n\n(Watch the clip for more...and be sure to subscribe my Write With Impact newsletter on LinkedIn for the full one-hour conversation.)\n\n#chatgpt #generativeai #writing",

While it slows down my reading pace, I do it  as a deliberate exercise in absorbing and analyzing the writing styles of writers I admire.\n\nI was going to make a nicely colored carousel on LinkedIn to make this point, but I don't think you need that (and I'd rather spend the time writing).\n\nThanks for reading (and listening).\n\nQuestion: How do you use your most powerful writing app--your ears--to improve your writing?

He had already been at the firm for five years and was transferring from another location. I was a fresh MBA grad incredibly excited about joining my dream firm. \n\nSince then, we’ve worked together on a range of initiatives: on client projects during my days as an associate, on crafting a new strategy for the Taipei office that has had enduring impact to this day, on publishing reports and articles in major media that have built our brand and attracted new clients. \n\nBut beyond work, Martin has had an even more profound impact on my career and my life. \n\nHe was instrumental in helping me make the transition from consulting to communications back in 1999, at a time when we didn’t really have anyone covering this function on a full time basis. I was the first, or one of the first, full time external communications specialists globally at McKinsey. \n\nMartin was there several years ago when I was going through a rough patch at work. He listened, he offered advice, and he stepped up and reached out on my behalf to senior colleagues about my situation. \n\nMartin was there when a close family member was seriously ill and I needed someone to lean on for advice and support. He made the time to meet with me outside of the office, to listen to my problems, and offer some potential solutions for consideration. \n\nBesides having the sharpest mind of any McKinsey partner I’ve known, he also happens to have the biggest heart. \n\nEvery year for the past two decades, Martin has—without fail—sent me a happy birthday email. He’s the only person to remember my birthday consistently every year outside of my immediate family members. \n\nAfter an extraordinary 30-year career at McKinsey, Martin retired last September.  His list of accomplishments is long indeed. He led the firm’s global strategy and corporate finance practice for the past 8 years, advising clients around the world on their toughest strategic issues and opportunities, and leading hundreds of super-smart strategic thinkers.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote and published a groundbreaking and bestselling book about strategy. \n\nAnd last year, he was awarded McKinsey’s highest prize for knowledge innovation: the Gluck Award. Sort of our Nobel for Knowledge. \n\nMartin, thank you for all that you’ve done for me, for our Taipei office, for our Greater China practice, for the firm. \n\nBest wishes on the next chapter in your career! \n\n#mentorship #mckinsey #sponsorship",

Percent.\n\nThe rest of the universe consists of dark matter (around 25%) and dark energy (around 70%). Both of these are invisible, and astrophysicists to this day can't seem to agree on what they are exactly. \n\nSo how is this relevant to creating and sharing content on LinkedIn?\n\nWhen I write an article or post on LinkedIn, I often get a number of reactions and comments from members.\n\nLike any other creator, I enjoy seeing my content resonate with people. It makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I invested my time well.\n\nI usually get a handful of thoughtful, insightful comments that I learn from and that challenge my thinking.\n\nThese reactions and comments attract even more people to my content, many of whom share it with their networks, further expanding my reach and impact.\n\nWhat I've discovered after 9 years (!) of creating content on LinkedIn is this: there's a huge, huge, HUGE swathe of people out there who are reading my articles and posts, but who *never* share a reaction or comment.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nI've met several people in person who have told me they've been following my content for years and like it--even though they have never reacted or commented on it, nor reached out about it via private message or email.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nKnow that when you create and then share content--when you share a piece of yourself--on LinkedIn (or any other platform)--many more people are reading and watching and paying attention to you than you'll ever know.\n\nEven if they never react publicly and visibly through a \"like\" or a comment, know that you ARE having an impact on them.\n\nAnd that in itself is another valuable benefit, another reward, for the time and effort you put into creating and sharing content on LinkedIn.\n\nThat makes it even more worth it.\n\nWhat do you think?

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "I was honored to deliver a guest lecture at National Taiwan University recently.🎓🏫\n\nIt was highly energizing to be on a college campus and in a lecture hall again. It felt surreal to be at the podium being the one to share my knowledge. For a kid from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it’s been quite a journey. \n\nI was highly impressed by the smart questions the students threw at me after my talk, and even more impressed by the student who published a LinkedIn blog post (in English, even though it’s his second or third language) the next day summarizing some of my key messages. \n\nI enjoyed my college and grad school experience and would do it all over again if given the chance. \n\nWhich prompts me to share some quick advice for current and future college students: \n\n\n📚Discover and pursue the subjects that drive your curiosity and fuel your motivation \n\nWhile the temptation to major in subjects that will put you on a path toward a job is understandable given the enormous cost of college and the need to get off to a good start in the working world, don’t let those dominate your course choices. \n\nBalance the practical, career-oriented subjects with ones that you’re genuinely interested in. You’ll derive more enjoyment from the learning process, will be more likely to retain what you study for a longer time, and will probably get better grades. \n\n\n🙋‍♀️ Be present and participate \n\nI skipped or slept through or doodled my way through my share of classes—especially economics and biology. I was not fond of those classes. Late nights studying or socializing can make it tough to sit through long lectures or seminars at 8:30 am. But do your best nonetheless to show up on time, avoid skipping class, and offer your opinion or ask a question during class. You’ll get a lot more out of your experience. Your parents will never know of course how much you showed up or participated, but this is about you and your future, not them. \n\n\n🐟🐠🐡Cast a wide net when socializing and networking \n\nI met so many interesting people in college and grad school and had some amazing times. I even met my future wife. But I still can’t help but harbor some regret over not meeting even more people. Time is limited and there’s only so much you can do in your waking hours, but I would still suggest broadening your social circles and participating in clubs and events that connect you with people you wouldn’t otherwise meet in class or your dormitory. \n\n\n☎️ Don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it\n\nThe invisible yet tangible pressure coming from society, from parents, from peers, and from the institution you’re attending can be overwhelming. High school pretends to prepare you for this experience but they don’t really. If you’re struggling, if you’re not feeling well, reach out for help. Whether it’s a friend, family member, or professional who you can talk to. Prioritize your mental health. \n\n#collegelife #universitylife #mentalhealth",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "I’m not a champagne drinker, but this is a special bottle that I’ll remember receiving for many years to come.🍾🥂\n\nThe managing partner of our office in Taipei gave this to me to celebrate my promotion at McKinsey. \n\nI’ve often been asked, and I’ve often pondered, why I’ve been here for so long. What keeps me motivated? Where do I get my energy? Am I still learning anything new? Am I still growing professionally? \n\nThese are questions I’ve pondered mostly privately of course, but also at times very publicly through my writing here on LinkedIn over the years. \n\nI write about my experiences and lessons learned along the way both to share what I’ve gone through with the hope of helping others—but also as my way of processing my experiences, of gleaning lessons from them.\n\nI am generally reluctant to toot the horn of my employer in my writing here because I fear it will sound promotional. Ironic for someone whose job it is to actually market the services of the firm that I work for. \n\nAnyway, here are a few things that come to mind from my 25 1/2-year journey at McKinsey & Company:\n\n\n✔️Extraordinary people\n\nI’ve worked with some of the smartest people I’ve ever known. I feel privileged to learn from them. I also feel privileged to have the chance to share my own skills and knowledge with them. To contribute to their success. But what really amazes me is the kindness, the graciousness, the care and concern for others, that characterizes the people I get to work with. \n\n\n✔️Opportunities to learn and grow\n\nI don’t care how senior or experienced I get, I can’t imagine not wanting to learn something new or try something different. I can’t imagine, in other words, not wanting to grow or change as a professional or as a person. \n\nMcKinsey has given me an abundance of resources and opportunities to learn new things, experiment with new approaches and formats (like being one of the first in our firm to launch a podcast back in 2011 when few people here listened or even knew what a podcast was) and just try things out without continuously obsessing with performance metrics like page views or video plays or podcast downloads or media hits or whatever. \n\n\n✔️Feedback-rich environment \n\nWe are an intense, impact-focused firm. What fuels this remarkable engine is many things, one of which is a constant flow of feedback. It’s this feedback that tells me what I’m doing is having a positive impact and therefore I should keep doing it or figure out a way to do more of it. It’s this feedback that also tells me when I’ve done something that hasn’t landed well. \n\n\n✔️Room to recharge\n\nThe past three years since the pandemic flipped the world upside down have been particularly challenging for me on the health front. I’m grateful for the time I’ve had to recover and recharge after these situations.\n\n\nThank you to the many people who have supported me throughout my journey. Above all, thank you to my wife and family. \n\n\n#gratitude #professionaldevelopment #personalgrowth",

By 2025, another 71 million households could enter this high-income bracket.\n\nTrend #2: Premiumization maintains momentum\n\nDespite rising anxiety over the economy and their personal incomes, when they do spend, consumers still trade up to more premium brands when they’re looking to reward themselves. \n\nThe strong growth of upper-middle and high-income households and the spending power they bring to bear has proved to be a boon for high-quality and premium brands: 26 percent of these wealthier respondents said they spent more in 2022 compared with the previous year. Only 14 percent of these consumers said they had cut their spending in 2022.\n\nTrend #3: Smarter choices, but not trading down\n\nChinese consumers are tightening their belts: In 2022, the proportion of respondents who said they or their family increased spending by 5 percent or more versus the previous year fell by half from 32 percent in 2019 to 16 percent, while 22 percent said they had decreased their spending.\n\nAs a result, consumers are not trading down, but they are getting much smarter about what they buy and where.\n\nTrend #4: It’s all about the product\n\nIn 2022, functionality extended its lead as the most important factor influencing Chinese consumers of fast-moving consumer goods. Chinese consumers are deeply knowledgeable about the features and specifications of the products they buy, from the ingredients that go into their facial cream, to the type and quality of down feathers that make up their favorite jacket.\n\nTrend #5: Local companies are winning\n\nThe preference for local brands has accelerated in the past few years. And, contrary to what many think, national pride is not the only driving factor. Chinese brands today offer excellent products that are competitive or sometimes even superior to their foreign peers.\n\nClick here to download a free PDF of the full report:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gA4_iQMf\n\n#China #consumers #economy",

We are all trying to leap over our own hurdles, the ones that confront us each day at work and in life. \n\nWe are all trying to identify and solve a series of never-ending problems, some of which are small and easily resolvable, some that are very large and extraordinarily complicated. Some of our problems — our hurdles in life — seem to never be surmountable.\n\nAnd, just as we celebrate the resolution of one problem, another three crop up that we have to tackle. Yet we muster whatever energy we have to keep moving forward toward our goals.\n\nSo for my son, and for all other graduates like him this year who are marking this major milestone in your lives: \n\nTap deeply into those sources of energy that power you through the tough times; try to stay laser-focused on what lies ahead, without dwelling on the mistakes and regrets of the past; and keep looking out for — and jumping over — that seemingly endless series of hurdles that life inevitably throws at you.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2022!\n\n#inspiration #lifeandleadership #leadership #personaldevelopment \n#classof2022",

Solar energy powers photosynthesis in plants. Even the fossil fuels that power our homes and cars originally received their energy from the sun, albeit hundreds of millions or even billions of years ago.\n\nAmazingly, only a small portion of the energy radiated by the sun into space strikes the Earth, just one part in two billion. \n\nAn infinitesimally small amount relative to the sun’s total energy output, yet an absolutely enormous quantity of energy for those of us here on planet earth. The sun provides more energy in an hour than the United States can use in a year.\n\nI was contemplating these things as I looked out the window of my office in Taipei yesterday. I was mesmerized by the orange-red brilliance of the sun as it slowly dipped beneath the horizon, marking the transition from day to night.\n\nWatching the sun go down made me think about where I derive my own energy to do the things that I do, whether it’s at work, at home, or at the non-profit where I’ve been devoting my spare time.\n\nAt work, my energy has ebbed and flowed over the years, but I’ve learned to discover and sometimes rediscover the sources of energy that power my interest in what I do for a living. \n\nAt home, clearly the primary sources of energy are my family — my wife, my son, my daughter. I know they rely on me for their energy as well, but it’s absolutely a two-way exchange. We sustain each other.\n\nAnd in the non-profit realm, I draw energy from the knowledge that I’m devoting my time and skills to a cause that many people find deeply meaningful, including myself.\n\nWhere do you derive your energy? Please share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#inspiration #personaldevelopment  #energy",

(He's a senior at college getting ready to graduate).\n\nSince I couldn't be there to watch him, I of course asked him how he did, expecting he would tell me how he scored relative to his competitors: 1st? 2nd? 5th?\n\nInstead, he told me he got a \"personal best\" in the 200 meter dash. He beat his own record. \n\nHe also told me he ran a great first leg in the 4x400 meter relay.\n\n\"So many people cheering me on was nice.\"\n\nHe didn't tell me how he lined up against his competitors in any of his races, but it didn't seem to matter to him, nor to me. \n\nWhat mattered was that he ran as fast and as hard as he could, and he beat his own time.\n\nAt school, there are the metrics everyone obsesses over: GPA, class rank, what colleges you got accepted to. Students are constantly comparing themselves to each other.\n\nAt work, people are checking each other's title, scope of responsibility, number of direct reports, salary, and wondering where they are positioned in this race, and why they aren't where they believe they deserve to be.  \n\nComparison with others is inevitable. But isn't it more important to look at yourself, and compare your performance to your own? Isn't it more valuable to your own professional and personal growth to measure yourself against your own metrics?\n\nWhat are you doing to expand your knowledge and learn new skills? \n\nWhat are you doing today that will help you make that 1% improvement, that will help you step up from where you were last month or last year?\n\nHow do you maintain your focus on your own performance (while obsessing less about what the \"competition\" is doing)?\n\nPlease share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #inspiration \n\n(That's my son in the middle, #7)",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3yr ago": "Most of the time, when we sit down to write, we write with the intention of using the words that we produce. Whether we’re writing an email, a school essay, a business proposal, or a blog post, we’ve got a very specific goal in mind: inform a colleague, impress a teacher, persuade a client, educate a reader.\n\nBut what if you wrote without any intention of ever showing your words to the world? What if you wrote simply as a meditative exercise that can help you clear your mind, process your emotions, and tap into your creative potential?\n\nThat’s precisely what Julia Cameron recommends. Cameron is a poet, screenwriter, creativity coach, and author of 40 books, including \"The Miracle of Morning Pages: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Most Important Artist's Way Tool.\"\n\nIn her book, she introduces what she calls “morning pages”, a daily free-writing ritual that can help you sort through tough issues you might be tackling in your personal or professional life. “The morning pages are three pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness.”\n\nUnlike talk therapy, which can also be highly effective at address mental health issues, but which comes with a cost that may not always be completely covered by your insurance provider, morning pages is a simple and completely free exercise that requires no technology beyond a few sheets of paper and a pen or pencil. In fact, Cameron strongly advises against using a computer to write morning pages.\n\nIn addition to writing by hand, she also suggests:\n\nWrite as soon as you wake.\n\nCameron recommends writing morning pages as early as possible, soon after you wake-up, and after you’ve had your morning brew. “As a coffee lover myself, I wouldn’t want to get in the way of your favorite pick-me-up.”\n\nJust keep writing.\n\nWrite whatever comes to mind, however trivial it might seem. Just keep writing until you’ve filled three 8 1/2 x 11 inch pages, she advises. I try to fill three pages in a blue Moleskin notebook — not exactly the size of paper that Julia recommends. Use whatever size, thickness, or color of paper that feels right for you.\n\nDon’t write to publish.\n\nDon’t write with the expectation that you’ll use the material in a piece that you plan to publish. Write for yourself, and write without the inhibiting editorial voice in your head — the “Censor”, Cameron calls it — that tells you to cut this or that out of your writing.\n\nDon’t show your morning pages to anyone.\n\nCameron strongly advises to keep your morning pages entirely to yourself: “Nobody is allowed to read your morning pages except you. And you shouldn’t even read them yourself for the first eight weeks or so. Just write three pages…and write three more pages the next day.”\n\nHave you written morning pages, or practiced another similar journaling exercise?

There’s nothing more boring than reading a content piece that is all business. \n\nAnd I feel the same about conversations in my job.

It makes you stop and think deeply about the wonder of the gift we call life. It's heart-wrenching, yes, but also incredibly inspirational and even humorous.\n\nIn this short clip from our hour-long interview, Andrea talks about how, as she wrote her story, she had to relive the pain of that experience all over again:\n\n\"To write this memoir the way I wanted to write it, I did have to relive it with the first draft. After I got past the first draft, it was much better. The first draft took me two years, and I had a therapist during that time specifically for this purpose. \n\nEvery day I worked on the book it was painful, and I usually worked on it six days a week. It’s just like this wound that just starts to heal and you’re going to rip off the scab again. It was a very difficult time, it really was. And once I got the first draft done, I didn’t look at it for months, because I needed a breather from it. It was really really difficult. \n\nI work in my sister’s point of view. All of that writing, including going back and reading things that she had written in her journal—I didn’t read her journal until after she died—just that exercise in itself, spending a whole day reading her journal, was very emotional for me. She was a great writer.\"\n\nIf you have a bit of extra time this weekend, you might want to listen to the full podcast on Apple Podcasts, or watch the full video (just look for Write With Impact on YouTube).\n\n#writinglife #memoirs #cancerfighter",

Her bestselling book \"Better Off Bald: A Life in 147 Days\" is a medical memoir about raising her younger sister Adrienne from the age of eight until she died from liver cancer at the age of 15. \n\nAndrea led a Writing Masterclass which I'll be sharing on Write With Impact Academy soon. In her class she shares several strategies she used to write her memoir. One of these is \"Show, don't tell\" -->\n\n\"I think it’s really important that you show and don’t tell. So, don’t tell me that you’re angry, show me what does anger look like. How does it feel? \n\nAnd that’s how you really hook people in, if they’re going through the experience with you.\n\nSometimes writers try too hard to tell readers what to feel, much like movies when they put too much music in and they’re telling us with the music exactly what to feel at exactly the right time. \n\nYou have to trust your readers a bit more, and show them and trust them to infer whatever meaning that you’re trying to convey. And maybe they’ll get a different meaning out of it and that’s okay.\n\nThere’s a joke in my book that my sister made, and most people thought it was funny, a lot of people thought it was horrible. That’s okay.\n\nI showed, and didn’t tell. With memoir, you have to be honest.\"\n\n#writingtips #memoirs #cancerfighter",

(Link to the episode in the comments below 👇)\n\nAndrea was a journalist with CNN for 12 years, here in Greater China, where I'm based (she speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and spent her junior year studying Chinese intensively while living with a family in Taipei), and in other exciting places. She reported on some of the biggest stories of the day. \n\nHer father is Ted Koppel, the former long-time anchor of ABC News, an icon in the broadcast news world, and someone I admire immensely, having grown up watching his program nearly every night.\n\nAndrea did an impressive amount of research before we spoke. She asked me about some of the very personal things I wrote about myself in some of my recent LinkedIn articles. She dug deeper and teased out of me some of the pivotal decisions and moments in my career.\n\nThis was the first time I've ever articulated my career experience on a podcast, even though I've written about bits and pieces of what I've done, and what I do, in my articles here on LinkedIn.\n\nShe is, in a nutshell, an *awesome* interviewer and has fast become a friend here. She even called me a \"mensch\", which if you're familiar at all with Yiddish, is considered a high honor.\n\nI strongly encourage you to subscribe to her podcast not to listen to me, but to listen to the truly amazing guests she invites on her show. And definitely do follow Andrea here on LinkedIn where she posts her heartfelt and very honest insights into her own life and career experiences, and of course, that of her guests. \n\nHERE ARE SOME OF THE TOPICS I COVERED WITH ANDREA ON HER TIME4COFFEE PODCAST:\n\nHow speaking Mandarin Chinese fluently helped my early career (5:20)\n\nWhat my first “real” job was like at a multinational advertising agency in Taiwan (7:34)\n\nWhat I do at McKinsey day-to-day (9:54)\n\nHow one story that I wrote for an internal publication changed the trajectory of my career at McKinsey (14:15)\n\nWhat I mean when I talk about developing your “superpower” and how to discover yours (18:05)\n\nHow cultivating strong transferable skills helped my career (33:20)\n\nWhat are some of the benefits of working for a large, global firm (35:24)\n\nHow my failures positively affected my post-failure performance (46:13)\n\nAnd bonus \"TMI\" (Too Much Information): Why I wished that I had partied more in college (50:07) \n\n(Link to the episode on Time4Coffee in the comments below 👇)\n\n#podcast #careerchoices #careerdevelopment #careeradvice",

And that primed my brain to be open to ideas or ways of thinking about it, or analogies I could use, or stories I could tell.\n\nSo, by the time I actually sat down to write I had some ideas. In some cases I would jot them down on a note on my phone. And then when I would sit down I would flesh out what I was already thinking. That was a huge help, just doing that pre-thinking before I sat down to write.\"\n\n#writing #storytelling #books",

The beautiful thing about blogging and social media, when you write really rich content on social media, is by just doing it repetitively, the more you do it, the more comfortable you get with it. \n\nIt’s like learning to speak a language.  You just keep speaking it until you feel fluent. That’s how writing has become for me. I’m a very confident writer now but I was not 10 years ago.\n\nBeyond that I think the most important thing that you can do is just commit to writing. And sometimes it is easier to start on one of those platforms. \n\nIt’s like a stream, where you write something and it moves down and it moves on, because it feels like a little bit less of a commitment.\n\nBut the other thing you can do is if you decide, for example, to start a blog, or you decide to do vlogging, and let’s say you’re posting a video every week, you can just make a commitment to once a week posting a piece of content. \n\nAnd just know that 80% of it will be kind of mediocre, and 20% will be amazing and make your name on the internet.\n\nAnd that’s okay: the only way to get to that 20% that makes your name on the internet is to do the other 80% also, because it’s practice, your honing your voice, your honing your process, you’re getting better at the language that you’re learning to speak.\n\nAnd that’s the purpose of it. So, all of those people you know who want to write, they just need to start. Jeff Goins says that, 'You’re a writer, start writing.' \n\nThat’s how you become one, you just start doing it.\"\n\n#writing #content #publishing #contentmarketing",

He got me a job in the place that built them. And I was in heaven.”\n\nThere have been many instances in my life where I’ve struggled to muster the courage to ask for something I wanted, fearing that my request would be refused, or that I would embarrass myself for even asking. Yet, in many of those instances, because I asked, the outcome turned out to be very positive.\n\nThere’s an art to asking for something you want, and at the right moment. Figuring out what someone needs and offering something of value to them can be an effective strategy for getting the “yes” that you’re looking for. \n\nSteve continues: “I’ve never found anyone who said ‘no’ or hung up the phone when I called,” says Steve. “I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be responsive to pay that debt of gratitude back.”\n\n“Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask. And that’s what separates sometimes the people that do things from the people that just dream about them,” says Steve.\n\n“You've gotta act, and you’ve gotta be willing to fail, and you’ve gotta be willing to crash and burn, with people on the phone, with starting a company, or whatever.\"\n\n\"If you’re afraid of failing you won’t get very far.”\n\n❓ QUESTION: What's an experience you've had of finally getting something you've wanted for a long time because you asked for it? \n\n✍ Please share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#stevejobs #inspiration #askingforhelp #careerhelp",

The kind of writing I'm doing is not a sales campaign. It's not designed to talk about your latest offering or product. It's not that at all.\n\n⁉ Some people are like, wait a minute, what are you writing about? It's very foreign to them to share anything other than “hire me.” It's really about providing value. And the way you do that is you share your expertise. Every person I've talked to is like, I don't know if I have anything to share. How could my story and what I'm doing really impact anyone else?\n\n💪You always, always have an impact. Once you've put something out there it will impact at least one life. And they will tell you, maybe privately, or months after that post, “I've been following you for a while and wow, I really like the way you think, I like the way you move through the world, I like your perspective.” This happens to my clients, too.\n\n😊 That’s super meaningful for the person who's putting the content out because often they have no idea (if anyone is reading) and they think they might just be shouting into the abyss.\n\n👇Links to the full interview in the comments👇\n\n#writingadvice #writingtips #servingothers #thoughtleadership",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3yr ago": "✍ WRITING TIPS OF THE DAY: HOW TO WRITE A BUSINESS-SCHOOL APPLICATION ESSAY 💪🎓\n\n27 years ago I wrote the application essay that helped me get accepted to Wharton's MBA program. I wrote about the \"leadership lessons I learned from fishing.\"  Here are some tips that might help you if you're writing an essay soon:\n\n💡 TIP 1: Write what you know 🧠\nI struggled with some of the essays I wrote for other schools I applied to. But this one moved from my fingers to the keyboard a lot more effortlessly because I was able to draw from a deep well of memories that had been accumulating since I was a young boy.\n \n💡 TIP 2: Write from the heart 💗\nThis is the flip-side of the point about writing what you know. It’s the creative, “right-brain” approach, compared to the coolly logical “left-brain” approach of drawing from the facts and figures stored in that vast database in your mind. \n\nI have a ton of fond memories from my days fishing as a kid with my dad and my brother. We enjoyed the beautiful ocean, lakes, and canals that I grew up surrounded by, and we connected deeply with nature through our fishing adventures. \n\nWe also bonded as a family, and produced a lot of amazing dinner supplies as well, which my mom turned into culinary creations. I tried to capture some of these feelings in the essay I wrote for Wharton.\n\n💡 TIP 3: Reveal something about yourself 🤦‍♂️\nThis can be tough, especially when trying to impress a group of tired admissions officers reading through thousands upon thousands of essays. \n\nYou may not feel comfortable baring your soul, and that's okay. You don't need to over-share. But if you hope to have an impact on your reader that will last for more than a few fleeting moments, pry open the window and give them a peek into who you really are. \n\n💡 TIP 4: Tell a story 📃\nFiction writers seem to get all the glory for being able to craft stories that move the heart and the mind. But I believe there’s a lot that non-fiction writers can and should learn from fiction writers about creating memorable stories. \n\nAs a writer of an application essay for business school, consider yourself a non-fiction storyteller writing the sort of stories that make those tired admissions officers sit up and say, “Hey, this one’s pretty good!”\n\nTell a story of a challenge you encountered, and describe how you overcame it—or maybe were overwhelmed by it. Maybe you failed at something, but then tell what you learned from that experience. Tell how you've grown from it and become the person that you are today.\n\n💡 TIP 5: Edit obsessively 👌\nI remember every time I thought my essay was done and ready to send in — it wasn’t. I sweated over my choice of words, syntax, grammar, spelling, and tone. I wrote and rewrote. Obsessively. \n\nMy advice? Have at least one or two people — not your partner or mother — who can offer objective, hard-nosed feedback on your essay.\n\nWhat do you think? Agree? Disagree?\n\n#mbaadmission #mbaapplication #Wharton #businessschools",

It’s like there’s only the good stuff, because God forbid you share anything that would portray you as someone who's made a mistake or had a supposed failure.\n\nBut the opposite is true. People respond to humans, to imperfect people. And when you're a leader, of course you've made mistakes. Everybody has stumbled. But the important thing is, when you're sharing about that, is to say, you know, this happened, but this is how I found my way out. \n\nAnd something like that will endear you to other people; they'll also come to see you as human. You leave them with something that they connect better with, because you're not somebody that's up on a pedestal imparting your wisdom.\n\nThat genuineness really translates well across social media, because we both know there are a lot of people that do the opposite. And sorry, you're going to alienate people, or they're going to keep scrolling. I would personally much rather read and share something that is real world, real life.\"  \n\n👇 Check out the links to Amy's Substack newsletter (and do subscribe) and Forbes column in the comments below\n\nAnd please reach out and connect with me (or just follow if you prefer) for more writing tips!\n\n#leadership #writingadvice #writingtips",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3yr ago": "Normally I'm not a big fan of celebrating my own birthday, choosing to quickly and quietly move through the passage of each year without making a particular fuss. \n\nUntil this week.\n\nLast November, on Thanksgiving Day, I underwent a 5-hour emergency operation that saved my life. \n\nIn addition to gaining a new appreciation for my own life, I've also learned to appreciate even more deeply than ever before my mother. \n\nLooking at a photo of her holding me as a baby, I think about the sacrifices she made to raise me and my siblings, and to support my father through his busy career, his brief stint in local politics, and his weekend fishing trips. \n\nIt certainly wasn't for lack of academic ability that she didn't pursue her own career. Growing up in a small steel town in Pittsburgh, my mother was a straight-A student who was accepted at Carnegie Tech University (renamed Carnegie-Mellon Univ.), which she attended for a brief time before dropping out to get married.\n\nShe has always been a voracious reader, a gifted writer, an open-minded and embracing person to everyone she meets. \n\nWhich sometimes makes me wonder: Just how many opportunities did my mom give up to pursue her own career for the sake of raising me and our family?\n\nPerhaps not so coincidentally (I do believe in the concept of 'synchronicity', or as they say in Chinese, 'yuan-fen'), today I received an email from a former McKinsey colleague of mine, Denielle Sachs, who today leads APCO Impact, the social impact arm of the global public affairs firm.\n\nShe writes: \n\n\"Moms have made heroic efforts over the last 18 months, but at great cost. Since COVID-19 first hit the US, over 2M women have left — or been forced to leave — their jobs, bringing workforce participation to its lowest point in 30 years. \n\nThe pandemic didn’t undermine a functioning system. Rather, it exposed what women have known for decades: work doesn’t work for moms, and work-life balance is an illusion.\"\n\n\"APCO Impact, in partnership with the Marshall Plan for Moms, announced a groundbreaking piece of research. Combining insights from a survey of more than 1,000 American moms, hundreds of academic studies, and dozens of expert interviews, their report, \"Making Workplaces Work for Moms,\" lays out a “Bill of Rights” for working moms & 10 recommendations for employers to help moms return to — and thrive at — work.\"\n\nI couldn't help but share their 10-point \"Bill of Rights\" for working moms here (click the link in the comments to read the full report)\n\n✔1. Give Us Control Over Our Schedules  \n✔2. Support Us With Child Care \n✔3. Own Your Role in Shaping Dynamics at Home  \n✔4. Prioritize Moms' Mental Health  \n✔5. Close Your Gender Pay Gap and Pay Moms Fairly \n✔6. Root Out the Motherhood Penalty \n✔7. Don't Rush New Moms Back to Work Before They're Ready\n✔8. Provide Better On-Ramps to Bring Moms Back to Work\n✔9. Guarantee Paid Sick Leave  \n✔10. Advocate for Moms Publicly\n\n#womenatwork #womenempoweringwomen #mentalhealth",

This is pretty much unlike any tech movement ever.  It's out of control. Enthusiasm is everywhere but unchecked, unfocused. \n\nIt means tech fills the gaps, not reimagines the container.\n\nThe problem is that we don't need people to apply AI to how they work, we need companies to ponder what AI means for their company, and build processes and structures from this down. \n\nThere are so many better questions than how can we use AI. Things like how do AI change what you make, how you make it, how you sell it, distribute it, how does it change your competition or even the nature of your market or what it is to be a company in that sector today.",

They can buy innovation once done and stick sales, equity and assets on the bottom line directly, the financial risk is tiny.\n\nBut if Pepsi spent $10m each on 20 internal startups each year, given their resources, wouldn’t they not be almost guaranteed 1 win per year?\n \n Would it not be a huge driver for talent.\nA huge R&D lab for people to learn how to thrive with limited budgets. \nWould it not end up creating far more success because it’s in the best place ever to win from?\n\nIt’s always seem to me that there are big companies that are great at being big, small companies are great at being small and growing, and if you want to get a large company to become agile, entrepreneurial, to take risk, to thrive in a changed environment, the best way to do this is for them to spin off continuously small thrusting start ups",

It allows you to efficiently reach, re target, persuade, those who already have some interest. \n\nWay too many people think growth comes from conversion or that it’s more efficient when “all is does” is place itself ever ever ever closer to the point of purchase, to claim success , to place a pixel in an interested parties interest, to “prove” that it worked. One looks smart immediately , one pays back over a generation  \n\nBoth are vital. Both are amazing. Both go together like food and water.  And please no more silliness about 30% vs 70% or whatnot.

What if bureaucracy is a more powerful force than efficiency?\n\nWhat if we automate the unnecessary so efficiently that bureaucracy proliferates.\n\nIf AI makes inefficiency effortless, does that make it progress?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts. How can we start reducing complexity not getting around it.\n\nHow can we create cultures that destroy mindless work, with things like trust, or empowerment, or enabling good judgment. \n\nAnd rather than building on form filling, permission getting, signature requesting, destroy it all and start again.",

People are too ignorant to learn this.\n\n- Better Locations \nMost chargers are where they’re easy to install, not where they’re needed.\n\nEV owners need them in safe, well-lit locations near highways with something to do for 20-40 minutes.\n\nHuge gas stations with 70+ pumps often have zero EV chargers—makes no sense.\n\n- Massive Fragmentation\n\nTo do this trip, I needed 10 different apps, and even that wasn’t enough. There are 35+ charging networks.\nYou find random ones like 7 Eleven with the best and unused chargers because nobody knows ! \nSome apps aggregate data, but info is incomplete and unreliable.\n\n- Real-Time Info Is Critical\nYou often can’t tell what’s ahead—broken chargers, long queues, chargers in employee-only lots, car parks closed at 6 PM, etc.\n\n- Everything Is Too Complicated\nImagine if every gas pump required an app.\nImagine if 50% of pumps stopped halfway through, and pricing was per kWh, per minute, and had extra fees for entering the station.\nThat’s the EV charging experience today—a bizarre mess from lack of care and thought.\n\nFixing This: A Simple Blueprint\n\n- More DC chargers, grouped in big locations (10+ per site).\n- Stop charging past 80%.\n- Allow credit card payments, no more apps.\n- Fine companies for broken chargers.\n- National chains should own this (Love’s, Racetrak, Walmart?).\n- One world-class app to show all chargers in real time—spend $10M on this, not $7.5B on 7 chargers ( digital infrastructure is often more vital than physical, it's resourceful allocation) \n\n- Clear queuing systems so people know where to line up ( painted lines and signs and only one access point please ) \n\nI still love my non-Tesla EV and will buy another, but charging infrastructure needs urgent fixes",

They’re just more data points.\n\nAnd that’s the real question with AI: \nWhich problems are solved by more data and which ones need something different?\n\nCan AI be creative if we just feed it more examples?\nCan AI design buildings that work, or only copy what exists?\nCan AI create new scientific understanding, or just optimize old knowledge?\n\nCan AI tell if a joke is funny? Predict if a tweet will go viral? Know if a song will be loved?\n\nIs it thinking, or just mimicking thought?\n\nAI is getting better, but how much better? When do we need something else.\n\nYou can ask AI to design a building, but it doesn't know what a building is, it doesn't know what a kitchen is,  it doesn't know what sunlight is, it doesn't know how people live, it doesn't know about problems with overheating, it doesn't know what a view is, what beauty is, but what if it never needed to? \nWhat if enough pictures of good, buildable, livable, code passing, zone pleasing homes are fed into it, that it can still work?\n\nOr will we always need something that understands, and thats a different thing.\n\nWhere is it actually useful, or valuable, these things are not the same.\n\nHow do we deploy it, and what does that mean for creativity, business, and the future?\n\nMore data solves more things. But does it solve everything? And does that matter? \n\nSome takeouts:\n\n1) Challenge the \"More Data = Smarter AI\" Assumption\nNot every problem is solved by throwing more data at it. \n\n2) Test AI on what It ynderstands, not just what It predicts\nAI can optimize ads, detect fraud, and predict behavior but can it explain why?  Push for AI systems that don’t just give results but provide deeper reasoning.\n\n3) Focus on Deployment, not just Development\nAI’s success isn’t about being impressive in a demo. The real challenge is applying it meaningfully in business, design, and society. Where will it actually create value?\n\n4) Stay skeptical—But open-minded\nAI’s future isn’t preordained. Some problems will be solved with scale, others need entirely new approaches. The key is knowing which is which.",

Machine Learning (ML): The Core of AI\nML enables systems to improve from experience and includes:\n-Deep Learning: \n-Statistical Learning: \n-Reinforcement Learning:\n\n2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI That Understands Language\nNLP enables AI to process and generate human language:\n-Translation: Google Translate, .\n-Text Generation: Chatbots, ChatGPT etc \n-Speech Recognition: Siri, Alexa, etc \n\n3. Computer Vision: AI That Sees\nAI interprets images and videos for:\n-Image Recognition: Face ID, medical diagnostics, security.\n-Object Detection: Self-driving cars, smart surveillance.\n-Scene Understanding: Real-time environmental analysis.\n\n4. Robotics: AI in Motion\nAI enables robots to:\nNavigate autonomously: Self-driving cars, drones. \nManipulate objects: Factory assembly, AI prosthetics.\nAdapt to environments: Responsive, intelligent robotics.\n\nSome people then add on separately other things....\n- Expert Systems: AI that makes decisions based on rules.\n- Speech : for spoken words.\n- Fussy logic :\n- and more.\n\nWhats even more confusing is most applications pull from many of them.\n\nGenerative AI spans 2, 3 or 4 of these depending on the nature of the output.\nSelf driving cars are all of them.\n\nSo AI is really an Ecosystem, Not a single technology\n\nAnd the ecosystem pulls in other parallel technologies \n\n- Greater computing power.\n- Bigger data.\n- Cloud and distributed computing \n- Sensors like Lidar and Radar\n- Networking like 5G, fiber.\n- More advanced UI's to maker access easier \n- Agentic workflows that automate across systems \n\nit gets soooo messy /\n\n\nWhat were really looking at is a whole canvas of possibility \n\nSo the next time you hear someone making sweeping predictions about AI, ask them: Which AI? Which technology? And in what way? \n\nWhich leads us to this oddly brilliantly complex and wrong AI generated image. Which ironically is perfectly made to show the mess.",

People are really strange. They are wonderful. They don't act remotely logically, or especially predictably. \n\nUnbeknownst to everyone in tech, including, bless him, Elon, Advertising largely doesn’t work by getting itself in the process of someone who already wants something, and quite specifically. \n\nThe job of the $1tn ad complex  isn't to find someone that wants a pair of leather platform sandals, and to place a tiny little banner ad in the way and a pixel.   Sure, that's a part of it.\n\nAdvertising is REALLY odd. It's REALLY mysterious, that what it's so wonderful to work in. \n\nIt works in about 138 ways including things like:\n- making you want to spend money on something you didn’t need\n- creating a shared image which means your choices reflect who you are to others \n- Slowly build interest in a category, like holidays in Paris. \n- persuading a buyer for a retailer to take the meeting with you.\n- persuading your partner to get you to buy something. \n- making you happy to spend a lot more on the same thing\n- Reassure you, that the expensive gift for your mum, will make her happy.\n- making you want to work for a company\n- getting the media owner to kill the negative piece on you.\n- making you feel better about what you have bought recently \n- making you pick a brand when it enters a new area \n- making you likely to stick with a company that had a fading reputation \n- recommending something to others\netc etc \n\nSo when we think somehow AI will change advertising and marketing because people will buy things in new ways, we need to step back and look at people.\n\nAI won’t make you buy another form of Coca Cola.\nAI won't replace shopping for things you enjoy looking around for.\nAI won't take over summer holiday planning, some friction is fun.\nYou would laugh at the idea for reasons you can’t explain",

When they get drunk, it's funny. They're posh & I want status. \n\nThey speak Italian in a cute way. They are relatable. You just get on, you find it oddly attractive that they like Stamp collecting, they know how to ski, they like talking about the world.... You get the idea......\n\nWhen was it?\nErm,maybe there was a date, a walk, a weekend away, or an argument, where things clicked or shifted, but it wasn't really like that. \n\nThere was no single reason or moment you fell in love. There wasn’t 4, there were hundreds. Some big, some small, some fast, some slow. \n\n\n\nOK. So I have a new car.  I like it a lot & I spent a typical time choosing it: 40 years. \n\nFor about 40 years I’ve been aware of cars.  My decision to buy this car came from perhaps 500,000 touchpoints.\n\nLike how nice the salesperson was, if they were on time, the cars smell, the incentives, how nice the dealer foyer was, the spec, the design\n\n& 200 outdoor billboards, print ads going back decades, the reviews of the car, PR about the car, 100 TV ads, etc etc etc.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I was probably bombarded with ads—retargeting, VIN-specific offers, dealer promos. Autotrader, KBB, JDPower, Cars. com \nprobably got my info. I don’t recall clicking any of it.\n\nYet some smart people in a room right now are debating attribution.\n\nOne says it’s the first ad that counted.\n\nAnother insists it was the last.\n\nSomeone, feeling sophisticated, brings up multi-touch.\n\nOr Time Decay. Or Linear. Or W-shaped. Or view-through.\n\nThey have data, studies, sophistication—but they are utterly wrong.\n\nBecause it was NEVER that simple.\n\nNo single ad makes a car sale, just as no single note makes a song or one \njoke makes you fall in love.\n\nAttribution is the art of claiming success, not creating it.\n\nPeople waste hours analyzing a flawed model of reality.\n\nAnd cars are just an extreme case.\n\nLook around—your detergent, shoes, sound system, soft drinks.\n\nWith the exception of 100% transacted online journeys or new DTC brands, attribution is mostly a massive distortion of reality.\n\nMost ads, most of the time, are a far weaker and slower force.\n\nWhy are we so incapable of accepting that some things unable to be understood with any precision, and that this is OK.\n\nWhy would we rather be precisely wrong, than generally, right?\n\nWhy do we let people sit and discuss things that are demonstrably preposterous for hours.\n\nTell me why I'm wrong.",

So people focused on the right lead, right way, right time.\n\nBy 2020, lead databases, email automation, integrations, meant it was pretty fast, pretty cheap, and pretty easy to contact 100,000 leads, but success rates were low. It was smarter to focus on fewer and better.\n\nBy 2025, it's all got out of hand.\n\nWhether it's job seeking, selling toner, training courses, web design or dating......\n\nPeople's inboxes are INUNDATED with emails.\nEven hot leads or the perfect customer, is unlikely to reply.\n\nSo as response rates tend to zero, everyone is \"forced\"  to send more emails.\n\nWhich means even more noise.\n\nWhich means lower response rates.\n\nWhich means even more outbound is sent, to make amends.\n\nAnd now we have AI to make writing \"personalized\" emails a scale, near immediate, near free of charge and near infinite in number \n\nWhich means inboxes just get killed and nobody wins.\n\nAs the cost of time, material cost, tech cost tend to zero, the entire world is just thoughtless writing to everyone.\n\nAI to make short emails long, to add something personal.\nAI to make long emails short, to get to the point.\nAI to block SPAM\nAi to get around SPAM\n\nNow we're seeing tiny companies mail out 100,000 people and hope for the best, not focus on the 3 people they should actually meet. \n\nAnd now nobody can win, regardless of how good your pitch is, your product is, your relationship, it's just noise.\n\nSo the solution was inbound marketing.\n\nWrite amazing article articles.\nPitch incredible publications\nMakes superb video.\n\nBut the same thing is happening with content creation.\n\nNext up, automated outbound phone calls, and avatars holding meetings.\n\nNow AI makes it easy to make stuff, nobody needs to think.\nNow AI makes it easy to post stuff, why post everything, why not post 24 times a day.

But in real-world usage, the term gets thrown around recklessly, often serving as a catch-all for any digital process, rebranded tech, or exaggerated capability.\n\nTake computer modeling, for example. It became Digital Twins, and now it’s labeled AI.\n\nModular Articulated Robots? Once a precise term, now lazily bundled under \"AI.\"\n\nEven my washing machine, with a single if statement, claims to have AI.\n\nAt this point, calling something \"AI\" is as vague as saying \"advanced computing.\"\n\nYou wouldn’t walk into a boardroom and ask, “Are you planning to use more sophisticated computing soon?”\n\nOr, “How will smarter use of better computers and data affect your revenue next year?”\n\nOr even, “What’s your computing strategy for 2025?”\n\nWe need to get far more specific.\n\nWhat technologies are we actually referring to?\n\nWhat strategies are being implemented?\n\nIs this a new way of thinking, or simply an evolution of what we’ve always done?\n\nIs this technology a point solution addressing a single problem , or does it \nrepresent a fundamental shift in how we approach business?\n\nThese are the real questions. When considering any new technology, we need to ask:\n\nAre we using it to enhance existing processes?\n\nOr are we rethinking entire systems from the ground up?\n\nBecause how we define and approach AI, or any tech for that matter determines whether it’s just another buzzword or a true driver of transformation.\n\n------\nIf you like stuff like this, try clicking the bell sign icon above 🔔 , as for some reason Linkedin doesn't show my stuff to my followers.

It’s not embarrassed to be wrong or trying to please anyone.\n\nWhile AI can mimic aspects of human thinking, it’s fundamentally different—more like a mirror reflecting back what it’s seen, rather than a mind experiencing the world.\n\nBut if the outputs are the same, better, or interestingly different… does it matter?",

Should I expect to see them rise through fame? \n\nMaybe I just have terrible taste and poor judgment, or maybe life isn't that fair.",

    "Tom Goodwin's post 1mo ago": "Wohay, it's time to bring out this old chestnut of mine\nWhat does this slide look like in 2030?\n\nWhat rules will AI change?\nIt’s one of the best questions out there.\n\nSome context -\nThe first big wave of change in our lives was the era of Computing & Connectivity.\n\nDesktops, Mobile phones, 3G, Wifi, Cloud computing,Big Data and more, all combined to form a new platform for business.\n\nCreating shifts in the “rules of business”, some examples ( there are way more that I cover in my books) \n-----\n1) Blurred lines.\n\nWe knew what a Bank was in 1990, but by 2010 Banks, Neobanks, digital wallets, payment layers had blurred the picture. Payment apps in China had greater cash deposits than most banks in the world. \n\nThis made many companies become horizontal, Google, Amazon, WeChat could be ANYTHING, by sitting on top and owning the customer interface.\n\n2) Geography vanished. \n\nThe BBC spent over 100 years to not enter the USA, or any other country.\nNetflix flicked a switch in jan 2016 to enter 130 new countries.\nThey didn't need an office, they didn't need lawyers, they needed to change a setting on servers and new payment pages.\nFrom Upwork to YouTube to Temu to Only Fans, boundaries have never been less relevant.\n\n3) Easier to build than change.\n\nEver noticed how Chase UK has a better banking app than Chase in the USA? It’s because one is a giant mess of old code, technical debt, old reporting and layers hastily added on to glue it together, but the new banking app started from scratch.\n\n4) Direct to Consumer \n\nRetailers and Wholesalers in many industries could be cut out, especially with digital services.\nWhy do Car companies need showrooms, when the internet is it, why put products on shelves if Instagram is the shelf now. \n\n5) Brands became more important\n\nThe Internet made the entire world the store.\nWe have more products and more brands than ever\nAt the same time we knew less about them. We had less trust. We couldn't touch things before we bought them.\n\nSo the interesting questions:\n\nIf AI/Gen AI is a new era of change, what old rules does it smash, what new rules does it create?\n\nHow does it change the rules of business?\nHow does it alter Consumer behaviors?\nHow does it change Consumer expectations?\n\nWe can now move from a Whopper to a Big Mac by moving our finger one inch to a different app, we can now change payment cards with a few clicks, we are now used to seeing services in real time, what you behaviors and expectations emerge?\n\nBe great to get your thoughts?\n\nI'm yet to be convinced that brands will be less important.\nI'm yet to believe the shopping will be done for us by bots.\n\nBut there will be MANY changes, and things that are very hard to imagine right now.\nBut in hindsight will seem inevitable.",

Have I become worthless? No, it's the system designed to ignore any Human dignity.\n\nAI exacerbates this by making applications easier to mass-produce, leading to hiring managers getting flooded with low-effort submissions, which in turn makes them filter more aggressively (often arbitrarily). \n\nThe result? More automation, more frustration, and a feedback loop of declining trust in the whole system.\n\nThe \"artisanal way\" is absolutely the move. \n\nLeverage real connections, have conversations, and look for ways to create opportunities rather than applying into the void. \n\nThe best jobs often aren't listed—they're created through conversations with the right people at the right time.\n\nThe best jobs are those you are in complete control of, that happen by going your own way.  It's never been easier to build.\n\nMeanwhile, if anyone you know is using the Internet to \"apply for jobs\", take care of them. \n\nConsider them someone dabbling on the edge of despair, wondering if they should find a drug dealer to ease their pain and emptiness .

Typing is faster. Scrolling is easier. Swiping takes zero effort. And learning new ways to do things is slow.\n\nBut then Generative AI came along and started reshaping things, creating new plasticity in habits.\n\n- Why read a 300-page business book when you could save 8 hours by asking AI three laser-focused questions?\n\n- Why skim a newspaper cover to cover when you could say, “Tell me five things that matter today,” and go deeper on the ones that intrigue you? \"is Trump really going to to be able to change Birthright law\" can save you 10 hours of outrage driven reading.\n\n- Why send clients a static deck when your company’s creds could be an interactive chat, where they ask exactly what they want to know?\n\n- What if training courses weren’t 20 hours of linear videos, but 5-minute interactive sessions whenever someone had a question? \n\n- What if instruction manuals or contracts became conversations?\n\nThe truth about new tech is that it’s not just about the tech—it’s about building the muscles and habits to use it.\n\n- Watching my first boss double-click a mouse was excruciating—it didn’t come naturally.\n- Seeing people send Outlook invites in 2002 felt clunky—it wasn’t “what we did.”\n- Even using voice-to-text today is awkward because our brains don’t naturally think how we write.\n\nBut here’s the thing:\n\n1) Younger generations are growing up native to these tools.\n2) Older generations are adapting (slowly, but surely).\n\nIn a year, so much of what we do could be conversational—but only in the right places. Knowing what will work and what won’t is key.\n\nI don’t think we’ll shop through conversations—trust and visual options are still too important.\n\nI don’t think entertainment will come this way—TikTok proves we want zero effort there.\n\nBut news?

Absolutely ripe for conversational reinvention.\n\nImagine buying travel insurance or getting personalized advice on car loans, or finally understanding what’s buried in a 20-page warranty.\n\nCombine it with agents / swarms etc and it can go even further, here are 4 things in need with Auto insurance, get me the best deal,  for example.\n\nGenerative AI won’t change everything, but it’s going to re-engineer huge chunks of customer journeys—and spotting those opportunities is where the magic lies.\n\nThe process of considering what it won't change is even more important, I'll still be in TJMaxx obsessing over finding once again a copper saucepan with a mislabeled price.",

Almost gone, but retail bankruptcies are the same rate as they ever were.\n\nOf the Global Fortune 500, only NEW 12 companies were added in the last 25 years, while 324 new arrivals were older companies growing. \n\nDisruption didn’t sweep through industries as we imagined.\n\nInstead, the Internet redistributed distribution costs more than it rewrote the rules of business.\n\nDigital didn’t expand the addressable market as much as we thought. \n\nDigital didn’t change the fundamentals. People value convenience but also trust, reliability, and time-tested basics.\n\nThe Real Problem: Operational Apathy and Distractions.\n\nCompanies get stuck in their own processes.\n\nThey waste energy chasing distractions instead of focusing on meaningful, medium-sized changes that drive efficiency.\n\nThe best companies balance innovation with maintenance. They harness technology where it counts—calmly, strategically, and on their terms—not as a reaction to fear, but as a deliberate effort to make money and delight consumers.\n\nIt’s not always about inventing new economic rules but using great ideas to make even more sense in a digital age.\n\n-Success lies in delighting customers.\n-In maintaining the core while upgrading intelligently.\n-In reliability, continuous improvements, and the basics done brilliantly.\n\nAnd this is where Spinnaker Support—the sponsor of this post—excels.\n\nThey help businesses take control of their IT landscapes by offering third-party support for Oracle, SAP, and VMware systems. \n\nCompanies can now reduce the costs and complexity of vendor-provided maintenance, while gaining access to high-quality, personalized support from experienced engineers.\n\nBy extending the life of critical systems and addressing challenges like interoperability and vulnerability management, Spinnaker Support empowers businesses to focus on what truly matters—innovation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n\nFor organizations caught in the endless cycle of costly upgrades or struggling to find the right time for transformative changes, Spinnaker provides a smarter alternative: maintaining the core systems that drive the business, while freeing up resources for strategic growth.\n\nDisruption isn’t everything.  Focus, widespread improvements, and customer satisfaction? Maybe that’s the future.",

    "Tom Goodwin's post 2mo ago": "Markets are supposed to be efficient but they are actually weird.\nIf you like construction economics read on.\n\n-People in the US are having fewer kids than ever. Something rarely discussed.\n\n- 12m homes were constructed in the last 10 years, offering way more housing than new people entering the country \n\n- The average number of people per dwelling decreased massively, in 1960 it was 3.3, by 1980 it was 2.7, by 2000 it was 2.62 and by 2022 it's 2.5\n\n- We no longer have kids, we shove our Grandparents off to another state, so they don't talk about Fox News, and we want our kids to leave home for university. Which is all unlike most other countries.\n\n- And despite of this, we're building more 4 bedroom homes than ever.\n\n- And they we complain about the cost of housing rising.\n\nI'm not a construction expert but I do have a MEng and BArch and I've bought land to build a house.\n\nYou realize the single biggest impact on housing costs are\n\n1) Zoning (always) makes land insanely expensive, and also makes residential neighborhoods very boring \n\n2) Zoning (often) makes smaller buildings illegal (it's not Nimbyism, it's please keep the Poors away) \n\n3) Increasingly slow and complex permitting because for some reason Federal, State, Country, City and Neighborhood all want to get have a bit of the fun. This means modular or prefab construction is unscalable, it means every home is custom, made on site, and the time and complexity and risk of building is massive.\n\n4) At the same time most houses need mortgages, and to get a mortgage you need to show market value. Market value comes from Comps and comps largely ignore quality of construction, pleasantness of views, the wonderful walnut floorboards or the magical landscaping. Market value comes from spreadsheets where homes are turned into cost per square sq ft. Which largely comes from the zipcode.\n\n5) So if you're spending $600k on land, $150k on fees, spend 1 year getting permits, a year building, and construction costs $350 per sq ft,  and you home may sell for $800 per sq ft, you can either\n\n- Build a boring 5,000 sq ft home for $2.5m worth $4m\n- Build a wonderful  2,500 sq ft home for $1.625m worth $2m\n- Build an affordable cosy, homely starter 1,200 sq ft home for $1.170m worth $960k\n\nSo the whole market for small, cheap, accessible, homely homes makes no sense.\n\nPeople in large homes who don't need them, can't find smaller places to move into.\nPeople looking for starter home can't find them,\nPeople who want quality construction, architectural merit, or smaller luxury homes on larger lots, can't get mortgages to buy them.\n\nThe whole system needs to change \n1) Zoning that allows for smaller houses\n2) Far more standardized planning regulations\n3) Far more use of prefab, kit and modular homes.\n4) Far faster permitting process\n5) More imaginative valuations of homes based on desirability not cost per area.\n6) A culture where people buy homes to relish living in, not as the safest, most fungible asset class.",

Again, this is quite unique and explains my point 1 , above.\n\nB) The Bad.\n\n1) Suppressed content. \nI now get about five messages a week from people who wonder what happened to me. They say I've vanished. \n\nThey say they've always actively engaged in my stuff, but haven't seen it for weeks/months. They've chosen to follow me, but don't see me. They thought I'd had an accident or got writers block, or worse still , a job.\n\nI've not been shadow banned, it's not a conspiracy, but clearly some algorithm God just doesn't think my stuff is worth seeing.\n\nI find it really odd that people have taken then steps to tell a site \"I want to see their stuff\" , have their wishes overwritten by an algo.\n\nWe also see that any links off site quickly die. Perish the thought a meaty white paper, a substantial presentation, an gem of an article, would provide value and dare be hosted anywhere else.\n\nI wish Linkedin would take your wishes above theirs.\n\n2) Suggested content.\n\nThe reason algos suggest content is because if we merely saw people who we'd followed, but saw everything they ever wrote, we'd be inundated. \n\nSo as part of deciding not to show you stuff, they show you things that seem to loved by other people a bit like you.\n\nThe issue is that the vast majority of people like crap.\nThey like simplistic\nThey engage in empty positivity.\nThey type \"Gold\" to get the \"10 tips for Gold\"\nThey comment on stuff that makes them angry.\nThey fall for the Clickbait.\n\nSo over time, people learn to write in such a way as to remove complexity, add a selfie, offer banal platitudes, and get people angry.\n\nIt would be nice if algorithmic feeds could take a background role, show us what we've asked for, and let people be the mechanism by which new content, new people and new ideas are discovered.\n\nI'd share so much more stuff if I thought it would actually be viewed and help. I'd suggest so many people to follow, if Linkedin didn't already.",

    "Tom Goodwin's post 2mo ago": "Why is Digital Transformation So Slow?\n\nIt’s a question I can’t stop thinking about.\n\nWhy do so many companies still use bad software? Why aren’t airlines competing with world-class apps? Why don’t banks dominate the digital landscape and showcase their brilliance?\n\nFor years, I chalked it up to resistance to change, apathy, and a lack of ambition. Three big culprits seemed obvious:\n\n1️⃣ The End-User Problem: CEOs often don’t see how clunky tools hurt employees.\n\n2️⃣ The Business Case for Change: Overhauls are costly, and better apps don’t always feel “core” to the business.\n\n3️⃣ Lack of Talent: Many organizations simply don’t have access to the expertise needed.\n\nBut recently, I’ve uncovered a deeper, less-discussed factor: the fear of software license audits.\n\nHere’s how it plays out: As companies grow, their software spreads across departments, offices, and acquisitions—sometimes in ways that unintentionally skirt evolving license terms. \n\nMarketing adopts what was once just for Sales. \nNewly opened offices embrace the same software. \nAcquired companies are asked to use it too.\n\nMeanwhile, license terms quietly evolve, adding sneaky clauses that can turn everyday usage into potential infractions. It all seems fine—until the software vendor initiates a license audit.\n\nThese audits are the ultimate power move. Vendors know exactly how their software is used and where companies may inadvertently breach license conditions. They leverage this knowledge to threaten fines, cause disruption, and maintain control.\n\nThis creates a chilling effect:\n-They don’t argue about price hikes.\n -They don’t push for better support.\n -They don’t modernize.\n\nThe fear of audits locks companies into outdated systems, stalls transformation, and reinforces a power dynamic where vendors prioritize control over innovation.\n\nInterestingly, many enterprise companies are looking to third-party support to free up budget for digital transformation—but fear comes into play here too. \n\nCompanies worry that switching to third-party support will automatically trigger audits.\n\nHere’s the truth: Audits are rarely triggered solely by moving to third-party support and importantly, companies are fully within their rights to switch their maintenance contracts.\n\nThird-party support providers, like Spinnaker Support, specialize in helping companies manage critical systems—whether it’s Oracle, SAP, or VMware—while delivering benefits like enhanced security, better quality support, and significant cost savings. \nWhile third-party support can’t eliminate the possibility of audits, it gives companies the freedom to prioritize their business goals without fear.\n\nIn short, don’t let the fear of audits stall your progress. Digital transformation is possible, but it starts by questioning what’s holding you back and finding partners who align with your goals.\n\n(Thanks to Spinnaker Support for sponsoring this post and highlighting a critical issue that deserves more attention.)",

Sometimes I promote events I speak at or write content from them.\n\nBroadly.\nI help companies understand the changing world and the new possibilities from emerging technology, and explain what can be changed for the better and what to ignore.\n\nI do so in a very clear, common sense, pragmatic way, without fluff, but they are always inspiring, uplifting and fun.\n\nI leave people energized. I provoke debate, spark ideas, but offer clear, practical advice and clear next steps.\n\nI think we can use technology and imagination to make a better world, to make better companies, and to have a better role within them\n\nI think we need to shift from being safe in our jobs, to being proud of what we made happen.  \n\nNow is the time to be big and not small.

Her joy and deep sense of altruism are truly remarkable.\n\nThe film is called An Open Door—a fitting title, as her legacy is all about opening doors for others. Case in point: She uses proceeds from her books and speaking engagements to fully fund graduate school for over 20 students—debt-free!\n\nShe’s widely recognized, often stopped in airports by people touched by her work. And after our screening, she stayed to take photos and chat with hundreds of attendees.\n\nI think, like me, they admire what she stands for: that there is beauty and value in our differences, that diverse ways of thinking drive innovation, and that neurodiversity is vital to society.\n\nAs she says: “The world needs all kinds of minds.”\n\nI was honored to represent the National Women's Hall of Fame, which exists to share the stories of extraordinary women like Dr. Grandin.\n\nHuge gratitude to John Festervand (Colorado State University) for helping preserve her legacy, John Barnhardt (Johnny B!!) for his dedication to women’s stories, and Jacob Faulkner  & Tyler Naretto for their artistry.\n\n✨ An Open Door will be released later this year. \nLearn more: https://lnkd.in/eKtjiZ5W\n\nSpecial thanks to Children's Health Council + Devyn Maugel, Stanford Neurodiversity Project + Emily Hsiao, Dr. Lawrence Fung , and my colleagues at the Hall— Beckie Robertson, Jean Kilbourne, Roger Schwartz and Anjana Samant.\n\nTruly, the best birthday ever. 🎉",

I will be all over brand plans, demand generation & in-market execution. That is where I will spend 95% of my time.”\n\n↳ translation? growth happens when leadership is obsessed with demand creation.\n\n↳ he is, in essence, saying the CEO should own marketing.\n\nthis is rare. while most executives delegate consumer connections, fernandez is making it clear: staying essential starts at the top.\n\n2. the marketing revolution\n\nfernandez is ripping up unilever’s marketing playbook. his focus? shifting from top-down branding to desirability at scale.\n\nhis plan:\n\n↳ increase marketing spend from 13% to 16%+\n\n↳ shift social media spend from 30% to 50%\n\n↳ work with 20x more influencers\n\nthis is empathy in action. big brands no longer control the conversation—people do.\n\nwinning companies won’t just push their message. they’ll build systems of advocacy where real people, in real time, amplify relevance.\n\n3. the premium imperative\n\nunilever is shifting from 35% premium to 50% premium. why?\n\nbecause each incremental unit delivers a 60%+ gross margin.\n\nfernandez’s mantra? “desire at scale.” not just marketing hype—injecting desirability into everyday products through superior functionality, aesthetics, and sensory experiences.\n\n↳ the commodity trap is a mindset, not a market reality.\n\n↳ when you elevate the experience, you elevate the margin.\n\nbottom line:\n\nwhether you’re running a startup or leading a Fortune 500 division:\n\n- be a frontline leader—growth happens at the customer level, not in strategy meetings\n\n- stop relying on corporate messaging—build systems where authentic voices advocate for you at scale\n\n- find your premium angle—even a commodity business can create “desire at scale”\n\nremember: the companies that stay essential won’t wait for change. they’ll create it.\n\n#leadership #marketing #growth #transformation #strategy #relevance \n#ceoinsights #cmoinsights",

Her playbook for leaders and entrepreneurs:\n\n1️⃣ Play the long game – She turned down Elvis wanting to record \"I Will Always Love You\" to keep her publishing rights. That decision later earned her millions when Whitney Houston recorded it.\n\n2️⃣ Own your brand – \"Find out who you are, and do it on purpose.\" When you're unmistakably YOU, you become unforgettable.\n\n3️⃣ Expand your brand – From music to Dollywood to films to books—she built multiple revenue streams while staying true to her vision.\n\n4️⃣ Generosity is a super power – Her Imagination Library has given over 200 million books to children. Her legacy isn't just wealth, it's impact.\n\n5️⃣ Stay relevant – At 79, she's collaborating with new artists and reaching new audiences. Reinvention isn't optional—it's essential.\n\n💡 This is part of my new series: Business Lessons from People Who Did It Their Way. Who should I feature next?

    "Shama Hyder's post 2mo ago": "Why do most transformation initiatives fail?\n\nThey lack the strategic focus on attention, relevance, and loyalty—the principles that history’s greatest change agents understood so well.\n\nHere’s the difference:\n\nMost leaders try to push change through authority or power. But transformational leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. knew how to capture attention, stay relevant, and build movements grounded in loyalty.\n\n1. Movements beat moments.\n\nWhen Gandhi led the Salt March in 1930, it wasn’t just about salt—it was about laying the foundation for a broader independence movement. The symbolic act rallied millions and created sustained momentum. Transformation isn’t about quick wins; it’s about creating relevance that endures.\n\n2. Pressure points matter more than power.\n\nKing didn’t try to tackle segregation everywhere at once. Instead, he focused on one strategic lever: the Montgomery bus system. By disrupting it, he sparked systemic change. Transformation succeeds when you focus attention on critical levers that create ripple effects.\n\n3. Shared values trump force.\n\nGandhi united a diverse India by emphasizing shared values like freedom and dignity, while King’s “I Have a Dream” speech inspired millions by anchoring his vision in universal ideals. Building on what connects us fosters loyalty and dissolves resistance.\n\nHere’s the key takeaway:\n\nThese aren’t just lessons from the past; they’re essential for today. In a world of constant disruption, attention, relevance, and loyalty are the bedrock of lasting transformation.\n\nThe bottom line: Lasting change isn’t forced—it’s earned through strategic patience, precise focus, and a shared vision.\n\nRemember: The fastest path to change isn’t always direct. Sometimes, the longest way around is the shortest way home.\n\n#leadership #relevance #attention #loyalty #transformation",

The future of media—and it's not what you think.\n\nTechCrunch just announced another round of layoffs, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEarlier this month, The Washington Post made a move that signals an even bigger shift: they dissolved their traditional PR team in favor of a new \"Star Talent Unit.\" \n\nWhy? Because they recognize that the future of media influence isn't just about institutional authority – it's about individual voices and direct audience connections.\n\nImagine Kim Kardashian as a legal contributor for the Washington Post. One Instagram post from her about a WP story could generate millions of views and engagements – more reach than any of their stories.\n\nSound far-fetched? It's already happening:\n\n↳50% of journalists globally are now freelancers\n↳Creator-journalists are building massive direct audiences\n↳Legacy media is betting on personality-driven content\n↳The lines between journalism, influence, and audience engagement are disappearing\n\nI've been beating this drum long before 2019. The future isn't just about earned media or paid placements – it's about understanding how these boundaries are dissolving. \n\nWhen a journalist-turned-creator posts sponsored content that goes viral and gets picked up by traditional media, is that earned, paid, or owned? \n\nThe truth is, it's all of the above.\n\nThis isn't disruption. It's evolution. The traditional silos of paid, earned, and owned media are merging into one integrated ecosystem where influence flows freely between channels.\n\nCreator partnerships blur into journalism, social posts transform into news coverage, and branded content drives organic conversation.\n\nThe Washington Post's move isn't just a restructuring – it's validation of what I've known all along: success in today's media landscape requires understanding this convergence. It's about building a multi-channel strategy.\n\nCreativity. \nFlexibility. \nResponsiveness. \n\nThis is the road to relevance. \n\nQuestion is: is your strategy still stuck in silos?\n\n#futureofwork #mediastrategy #pr #innovation #techcrunch",

    "Shama Hyder's post 3mo ago": "Dear CEOs,\n\nRight now, as your marketing teams read this, they're hoping you'll see it - or that someone will be brave enough to share it with you.\n\nFor 20 years, big tech has trained you to demand numbers - ANY numbers - even if they're complete horseshit. You're asking marketers \"What's the ROI?\" because Google and Facebook convinced you everything must be measurable.\n\nHere's a reality check: 60% of people searching Google aren't even clicking anything. They get what they need and leave. They are influenced by things you aren’t even investing in. \n\nLet me be clear: It's not that things shouldn't be measured. They should. But this isn't it. This obsessive, granular measurement of everything has become a security blanket that's suffocating real growth.\n\nHere's what's really happening: Trillion-dollar tech companies preyed on your fears and hijacked your marketing vision. They built their empires by convincing you that every marketing action must be measurable. It's been in their favor, not yours - they're the ones who became trillion-dollar businesses while your marketing teams are paralyzed by data.\n\nI'm writing to you because I've realized something crucial: Marketing can't fix marketing - but you can.\n\nBy what you choose to incentivize, you shape your company's future. Right now, you're incentivizing your marketing teams to play small, stay safe, and stick to metrics that look good in presentations but don't build lasting value.\n\nMarketing isn't like finance - it's more like R&D. It needs room to experiment, to take calculated risks, to think beyond the quarterly report. You have the power to break down the silos, to make your team play like a team and win.\n\nWant real market leadership? Start insisting your marketing team takes calculated risks. Yes, insisting. Because they've been so conditioned by fear that they might not do it without your explicit backing.\n\nThe next generation of market leaders won't be built by number crunchers. They'll be built by visionary teams who were given the freedom to think beyond the spreadsheet - by CEOs who understood that true marketing power comes from breaking free of the measurement trap.\n\nThe solution starts with you. What are you going to incentivize?\n\n#marketingstrategy #leadership #marketing #ceo",

Despite labor strikes at one and interesting leadership choices at the other.\n\n- I predict we will close out the year strong. Q1 and Q2 were sluggish but Q3 seems to be on the up and up. We are certainly seeing that at Zen Media.\n\n- AI is not slowing down. The next five years will look very different than the last, and relevance is not a guarantee for any brand.

Neglect weeding, and unwanted growth takes over.\n\n↳ Growth is gradual but compounding: You can't plant a seed today and expect fruit tomorrow. But with consistent care, your garden becomes more bountiful over time.\n\n↳ Seasons change, but the work doesn't stop: Even in winter, there's prep work for spring. In marketing, \"off-seasons\" are prime time for strategy and content creation.\n\n↳ Ecosystems are interconnected: Just as bees pollinate flowers, your various marketing efforts cross-pollinate, creating a self-sustaining system.\n\n↳ Patience yields the best harvest: Rush the process, and you'll end up with stunted growth. Give it time, and you'll reap rewards beyond your initial planting.\n\nToo often, companies treat marketing like a vending machine - insert budget, expect immediate results. But here's the hard truth:\n\nEvery time you abandon your marketing \"garden,\" you're not just pausing growth - you're allowing it to wither.\n\nThe key to marketing success? Consistent, nurturing effort - even if it means starting with a small plot and expanding gradually.\n\nDon't let short-term thinking turn your marketing ecosystem into a barren landscape. \n\nKeep tending to your garden, adjust your approach as needed, but never stop nurturing your growth.\n\nWhat's your experience with cultivating a marketing ecosystem?

Support tickets that are interesting or reflect common issues get fed into a production pipeline with an LLM like ChatGPT + other tools to turn into a variety of media -- tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog case studies, etc. \n\nNot only does this potentially proactively help others who have the same issue solve it without requiring support, but it creates a content marketing opportunity. \n\nVery naturally, the first layer of AI thinking is \"how do I make the things I'm doing now faster/better/cheaper?\" Some of the most exciting stuff however is going to come when people ask \"what can I do now that I never did before?\"",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 4mo ago": "There’s growing chatter that frontier labs are hitting a wall in terms of AI capabilities. Does this mean your enterprise can slow down the urgency of AI adoption?\n\n𝗡𝗼𝗽𝗲, 𝘀𝗼𝗿𝗿𝘆.\n\nFirst, let’s explain what’s actually going on. This is all based on a report from The Information, whose sources at OpenAI said that the company has found the performance improvements of their latest model Orion to be not as significant as previous jumps in the state of the art. There’s some reporting that Google’s dealing with the same thing with the latest version of Gemini.\n\nThe nuance is that the challenge seems to be about the limitations of the previous method for scaling LLMs, which was throwing more data and compute at them during the pre-training process.\n\nTurns out, that’s not the only way to increase capabilities.\n\nWe’ve already gotten a preview of this with OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. That model uses a strategy called “test-time compute” which is a different approach during the inference phase, which happens after the model has been prompted.\n\nHere’s OpenAI researcher Noam Brown describing the results: “𝘐𝘵 𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢 𝘣𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 20 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘢 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘱𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘨𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘶𝘱 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘣𝘺 100,000𝘹 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 100,000 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘴 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘳.”\n\nThe point is: just because one approach to scaling is showing limitations doesn’t mean that model advances are going to stop.\n\nWhat’s more, when it comes to the question of enterprise AI transformation, it’s not really about the state of the art.\n\nInstead, AI transformation is about analyzing existing workflows and processes and asking whether there is an AI powered alternative - be it an AI-assisted human process or an Agent automated process, that would be more effective - in a never-ending loop.\n\nWe’re so barely scratching the surface of what today’s models can do to improve efficiency and create new opportunities that a change in how the big labs are thinking about scaling really just doesn’t change anything about the lived reality of AI for companies.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 4mo ago": "GenAI transformation is the defining challenge and opportunity for enterprises right now. Here are 5 big blockers to enterprise AI adoption.\n\n1. Unclear mandates\nAI transformation has to start from the top. Not only do executives need to be talking about GenAI, they need to be using GenAI, and they need to be painting a vision for the company’s future empowered by GenAI. Employees need to know that 1) GenAI adoption is a priority; and that 2) it’s a priority not because leadership wants to fire half the company and do the same with less, but because they want to realize the AI opportunity to do more and better things than we’re ever possible before.\n\n2. Invisible Usage\nOne of the reasons that clear mandates from the top are so important is that right now much of AI usage in the enterprise is invisible - either because there aren’t systems for sharing (see below) or because employees are purposefully keeping their AI use secret. Many employees using AI are worried they’re breaking rules, worried their work will not be treated as legitimate, or worried that using AI will make them seem replaceable. Microsoft/LinkedIn found that of the 75% of knowledge workers using AI, 78% weren’t telling anyone about it.\n\n3. Use Case Confusion\nGenAI is self evidently powerful. Exactly what to use GenAI for to get value, however, is less clear. Most companies are still at the stage where every employee has to act like a use case explorer, tinkering, experimenting, and hopefully finding something that works. This is radically inefficient, and leads to anemic adoption and lots of repeated mistakes. By the way, invisible usage exacerbates this problem. Invisible usage means that people don’t get to learn from each other’s experience.\n\n4. No Systems for Sharing Best Practices\nSometimes usage is invisible because employees are worried about the reaction to them using AI. But a lot of times it’s invisible because there simply aren’t currently structures and systems for them to share what they’re learning. Companies need robust, ideally software driven systems for capturing information about AI usage and distributing best practices across the organization. ahem superintelligent ahem\n\n5. Inertia and a Need for Evangelism\nThe constraining factor on AI won’t be technological, it will be based on human and organizational inertia. Increasingly, we’re seeing enterprises recognize that even as they create mandates, and work to build systems for sharing, they need to be loud about that work. We’re even seeing (and helping!) some companies start entire internal facing marketing campaigns evangelizing AI use.\n\nWhat are the barriers you’re seeing?",

Anthropic announced “Computer Use.” It is exactly what it sounds like: Claude is now able to use the computer as a human would, pointing, clicking etc.\n\nThis is currently only available as an experiment, and it is only available through the API, meaning it requires a developer to put it into practice. What’s more, at this stage it’s functionally very expensive, and priced more for experiments than for being built into actual products or services.\n\nAnd yet, it very clear points in the direction of a very, very different future. Rather than having to adapt our workflows to LLMs, this shows how LLMs are increasingly just going to be able to imitate us.\n\nAnthropic found that when they empowered Claude with these new capabilities, it unlocked new functionality that the model hadn’t been trained on:\n\n\"We were surprised by how rapidly Claude generalized from the computer-use training we gave it on just a few pieces of simple software, such as a calculator and a text editor…In combination with Claude’s other skills, this training granted it the remarkable ability to turn a user’s written prompt into a sequence of logical steps and then take actions on the computer. We observed that the model would even self-correct and retry tasks when it encountered obstacles.\"\n\nIn the very short time Claude computer use has been available, developers have experimented with things like:\n🤼 Automated moderation of a Facebook group including accepting and rejecting new members\n💻 Automated feedback and debugging of code\n🍕 Ordering pizza for the Anthropic team as they were working on it\n\nLike OpenAI’s release of their reasoning o1 model, this is a very small baby step towards the agentic future. But baby or not, it is a step. I believe that when we look back, we’ll see both o1 and Computer Use as branches off on the AI evolutionary tree, away from previous LLMs and towards something new.",

Here are 3 ideas for how to use it for business. \n\nA couple months ago, NotebookLM from Google launched a feature called \"Audio Overview\" which basically could autogenerate a podcast about any document or set of documents. \n\nThe output is unbelievable impressive, but hasn't been guidable until now. With NotebookLM's latest features, you can click \"Customize\" in Audio Overviews to give more specific instructions, such as telling it to focus on a particular topic; emphasizing one source over the others, or changing the audience it's for. \n\nThis instantly makes NotebookLM Audio Overviews 1000% more useful for content creators and businesses. Which is good news, because Google claims 80,000 orgs are already using it for business. \n\nHere are 3 ideas for how to use NotebookLM Audio Overviews for business:\n\n1. Customer Service Insights -- feed it the transcripts of the day's (or week's) customer service calls and have it create a podcast about the most important insights that anyone in the company can learn from in just 5 or 10 minutes. \n\n2. Conversational Sales Pitch -- most companies have lots of written materials about their offerings, but that's different than pitching services in person. Share those materials with NotebookLM and see how it emphasizes the benefits and opportunities of the product or service in a conversational way. \n\n3. Weekly Project Reporting -- there are lots of meeting transcription and summary services, but NotebookLM could take internal alignment a step further. Imagine giving it the transcripts of all of a week's meetings from Fireflies or Otter and letting it create a summary podcast for execs that gives a birds eye view of where a project is and how it's proceeding. \n\nWhat use cases are you finding for NotebookLM?",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 5mo ago": "This is the most important AI term you’re going to start seeing everywhere:\n\nService-as-a-Software.\n\nSo, what does it mean?\n\nUp to now, SaaS has referred to “Software-as-a-Service.” It referred to a new way of provisioning software in the cloud. Over the last decade and a half, SaaS companies became integrated with just about every business workflow that exists. Enterprises could simply subscribe to the software, turning it off and on and expanding and contracting the size of their engagement at will. In general, SaaS worked on a cost-per-seat business model.\n\nMoving forward, generative AI will remake pretty much every business workflow once again. Broadly speaking; remaking will take two forms:\n1. Improved workflows undertaken AI-assisted humans\n2. Improved workflows undertaken by AI agents, managed by humans and/or other AI’s\n\nService-as-a-Software is the natural result of AI agent implemented workflows. In this model, the companies provisioning agents aren’t selling software that improve’s human work, but actually selling a version of the labor itself.\n\nOne of the most consequential changes emerging is around business model. When you’re selling the work itself, rather than an assistant to work, the per-seat model ceases to make sense. The new exploration is in pricing the actual outcomes and output.\n\nWe’re at the very early innings of this transition. How agents get integrated into existing processes is still a wide-open question. It’s also still too early to know how the business model norms will resolve.\n\nStill, it’s a big, consequential change, and one that you’re going to hear a lot more about in the months to come.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 5mo ago": "Here's something most companies will get wrong about AI at first:\n\nAI is a \"more with the same\" tech, not a \"the same with less\" tech. \n\nAaron Levie framed this on X this morning [see attached image] around Jevon's Paradox -- that increasing the efficiency of a resource actually tends to increase demand for the resource. \n\nAn unacknowledged assumption in a lot of the fears around AI is that the current demand we have for [everything] is the natural or max demand society has for that thing. So if that thing can be provisioned with far fewer resources, that means less work for the people doing the provisioning. \n\nFor example: if code is 1/10th as hard to create, then we'll only need 1/10th the coders. \n\nThe history of human experience shows us, however, that our ability to expand demand and consume more is pretty much endless. If code is 1/10th as hard to create, we wont have 1/10th the coders; we'll just produce 10x as much code. \n\nIn fact, even that is probably wrong. If code becomes 1/10th as hard to create, not only will today's coders produce 10x, but a whole new wave of people who wouldn't have been creating code before will get involved, so the net impact will be even more than 10x the code. \n\nBringing this back to companies, MANY are going to fall into the trap of thinking that AI is a \"doing the same with less\" technology, where they can get the same output with lower input costs. Initially, these companies may even be rewarded by markets focused entirely on the short-term who love cost cutting. \n\nIt won't take long, however, before they start to be wildly outcompeted by companies who realize that the real opportunity isn't \"the same with less,\" but \"more with the same,\" (and eventually even \"much, much, much more output with just a little more input\"). \n\nThe faster we can get bigco's thinking in \"more with the same\" terms, rather than \"the same with less\" terms, the better for everyone.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 5mo ago": "5 Reasons Workers Are Keeping AI Use Secret\n\nWhat’s true: workers are using AI. A Microsoft/LinkedIn study from earlier this year found 75% of knowledge workers using AI. A McKinsey survey from August put it at 91%.\n\nWhat’s also true: they’re keeping their usage quiet, if not outright secret. That first survey also found that, of those using AI, 78% weren’t telling any one.\n\nEthan Mollick called these users “Secret Cyborgs” and discussed why they’re keeping their AI use secret in a recent essay [linked in comments]. Riffing off that and adding my own experience, here are 5 reasons workers are keeping their AI use secret:\n\n1. They’re not sure what their company thinks about AI use. Most companies haven’t done a great job yet being clear about what is and isn’t okay. In many cases, that’s because they haven’t decided what is and isn’t okay. But given that workers are trying to do work better, not break rules, until there is more clarity, they’re keeping quiet.\n\n2. They don’t want their work to be seen as illegitimate. Work culture often focuses on measures of inputs like how long someone worked on something as a proxy for quality. This can easily lead to a fear of AI-enabled work being perceived as somehow “cheating.”\n\n3. They don’t want more work. Who owns the productivity gain of AI usage? Is it the employee who does things 25% faster and now has more time for other things, or is it the company who can now assign 25% more work. Some AI smuggling behavior is a byproduct of a fear that employers will just fill in newly available time with more tasks.\n\n4. There’s no good way to share what they’re doing. Even if a person wanted to tell all of their colleagues about the valuable use cases and new AI workflows they’ve uncovered, what’s the mechanism to do so? Enterprises new scalable systems to make AI usage visible. This is the central problem Superintelligent is solving.\n\n5. Simply put: they’re terrified someone is going to tell them they’re not allowed to use AI anymore. Once you go from a non-AI workflow to an AI-enabled workflow, most people truly can’t imagine going backwards. If there is ANY chance that revealing AI usage could lead to being told you’re not allowed to do that thing which makes your worklife so much better, people are going to stay silent.\n\nWhich of these are you seeing?",

Google went for a \"shock and awe\" strategy announcing a huge number of AI products and updates.\n\nThe watchword for the whole presentation was \"integration.\" More than ever, Google's AI is in every single Google product. Google isn't just grafting AI on to their existing products (which was what we saw last year from Google), they're updating their products with generative AI as the center of the product experience. This was particularly apparent in the integrations with Gmail, Search and AI Teammate for Google Workspace.\n\nOne thing that was shared between OpenAI's presentation and Google's presentation was the nudging towards an AI agent powered future. In many ways, the new features and products like GPT-4o and Project Astra are all retraining users on the types of human-computer interactions that will get them prepared for true agent experiences\n\nBy and large, the AI twittersphere was impressed with the announcements at Google. If there was a caveat with regard to Google's AI assistant tools like Project Astra, it's that there weren't live demos — Google presented pre-recorded videos. After they oversold Gemini Ultra last December, skepticism is higher.\n\nIndeed for the technically-minded Twitter AI community participants, OpenAI still came out ahead of this exchange. A poll from Stanford's Andrew Gao asking \"who wins AI today\" had OpenAI at 55.6% vs Google's 22.5%. Jenny AI from Microsoft asked \"So who won the week\" with OpenAI hitting 85.8% to Google's 14.2%.\n\nStill, the sheer quantity of announcements meant that most people weren't comparing whose AI assistant was the most state of the art. Even more than that, it's clear from I/O that Google isn't going after the AI Twitter community — they're going after the mass market of future potential AI users.",

Others are left saying \"that's it?\"\n\nPart of this is about what this wasn't: it wasn't an announcement about GPT4.5 or GPT-5. There is so much attention on the state of the art horserace that for some, anything less than that was going to be a disappointment no matter what.\n\nWhat this was, ultimately, was a product announcement. OpenAI is betting on a totally new mode of interacting with AI. The breakout experience was the chatbot of ChatGPT, but this announcement shows that their bet on the future of human-AI interactions is actually chatting with voice and vision.\n\nProduct announcements are going to inherently be more divisive than technology announcements because it's harder to tell if a product is going to be truly different until you actually interact with it. And especially when it comes to a different mode of human-computer interaction, there is even more room for diverse beliefs about how useful it's going to be.\n\nThat said, the fact that there wasn't a GPT4.5 or GPT5 announced is also distracting people from the technological advancement that this is a natively multimodal model. It's not a text model with a voice or image addition; it is multimodal token in, multimodal token out. This opens up a huge array of use cases that are going to take some time to filter into the consciousness.\n\nLastly, and most practically, it's hugely significant that they've made this model available for free to everyone, as well as making the API 50% cheaper. That is a MASSIVE increase in accessibility.\n\nTop 3 things from the announcement:\n\n3 - Truly natively multimodal model - this will likely transform use cases for ChatGPT as much or more as increasing the intelligence of the underlying model\n\n2 - Free access to their most advance model - huge transformation in accessibility\n\n1 - OpenAI's big bet on a new mode of interaction - OpenAI's like they're making a huge bet that Her-style interactions will replace typing to chatbots as the way we interact with AI",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 11mo ago": "Introducing Superintelligent - AKA The Most Important Thing I’ve Ever Worked On\n\nSuperintelligent is a fast, fun, platform for learning AI. Hundreds of video tutorials and step-by-step how-to's get you using AI tools in minutes. It’s AI learning that's actually useful.\n\nCheck it out at https://besuper.ai/ \n\nAnd if you want to hear more about how it came about…well here we go…\n\nI don’t think I have to tell most of you that the end of 2022 was VERY weird. Yet in that chaos and wreckage, I found myself having the same experience that so many others were having — trying ChatGPT or Midjourney and:\n\n1. Feeling like a friggin' wizard harnessing the power of all creation\n2. Almost instantly becoming convinced that generative AI really was going to change everything.\n\nThat led me to launching The AI Breakdown podcast, which almost immediately became as popular as the original Breakdown podcast.\n\nThe common experience of all of the listeners I heard from was that they had also become convinced that AI was going to change everything about how they worked and what they worked on, and felt it was imperative that they keep track of what was happening.\n\nMore than news though, what they really wanted was resources to learn. Sure, there were courses out there, but they tended to be very old school, very theoretical, very fragmented and limited in what they covered, and almost immediately out of date as soon as they were published.\n\nSuperintelligent takes a totally different approach. We’re focused on getting people actually using the most important AI tools and learning by doing. We’ve built a content production operation that has produced 300+ video tutorials (plus step-by-step How-To’s that go with them) and is adding 30-50 a week.\n\nThat change is coming is undeniable. A survey of CEOs found that they believed that HALF their employees skills would be irrelevant in just 2 years. The IMF says that AI will impact 60% of American workers.\n\nMy belief is that the single biggest factor in whether the AI revolution actually benefits people the way it could, versus becomes just another disruption they have no agency in, will be education. That’s why we're building Superintelligent.\n\nGo to https://besuper.ai/ // and if it’s interesting to you, use code “nlwlaunch” (not case sensitive) to get $10 off your first month. Can’t wait to hear what you think.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 1yr ago": "Why a Turing Award Winner Quit Google to Warn About AI\n\nThe AI safety question isn’t new. What’s new is:\n\n•GPT-4 (and other recent AI advances) having capabilities that many thought were years away\n•An all-consuming AI arms race in big tech\n•Hundreds of millions of new AI users grappling with AI safety questions for the first time\n\nOn that last point, my sense is that a lot of people just don’t know what to think. On the one hand, the arguments of the safety folks - coming through Bankless interviews or whatever transmission channel they come through - are compelling, and scary. On the other, things really can’t be that bad, right?\n\nGeoffrey Hinton seems to think they might be. Dr. Hinton is a pioneer of neural networks, something he started working on in 1972. In 2012, he built a neural network that could identify objects in photos with two students - one who would go on to be chief scientist at OpenAI. A company around it was soon acquired by Google. In 2018, Hinton’s work on neural networks won the Turing Award which is seen as akin to the Nobel Prize in computing.\n\nOver the last year, Hinton has gotten increasingly uncomfortable with the industry he helped found. There are a few reasons why. For one, the rate of change is faster than anyone expected. “Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now. Take the difference and propagate it forward. That’s scary.”\n\nOn top of that, he sees an arms race that will be nigh impossible to slow down. Microsoft jumping out ahead of Google on AI triggered a response from Google that, in Hinton’s estimation, undermined their previous stance of being careful not to release something that might cause harm.\n\nSo what is Hinton worried about? Kinda all of it. Fake information flooding the internet. A massive upheaval in the jobs market. Nefarious actors purposefully using it to do bad things. And well, even worse.\n\n“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that. But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”\n\nEnjoy this? Subscribe to The AI Breakdown newsletter: https://lnkd.in/gTpyzgXm",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 1yr ago": "Medium Capitalism\n\nOpenAI and their best-known creation ChatGPT have become so ubiquitous, so at the core of this new digital and economic paradigm, that it can be jarring to remember that they aren't just some public good like an internet protocol but are, in fact, a company.\n\nThat means shareholders. That means economic incentives. That means business decisions, not just tech decisions. OpenAI made a bunch of business decisions for ChatGPT this week.\n\nThe first is a privacy-focused update. ChatGPT users can now turn off chat history. Think incognito browsing for a comparison. When chat history is turned off, OpenAI won't use those chats to train their models, and all chats are permanently deleted after 30 days.\n\nThe second business decision is, well, ChatGPT business. It's a forthcoming subscription services \"for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\" By default these customers' data won't be used to train their models.\n\nYesterday they also released brand guidelines which are meant to crack down on how many projects slap \"GPT\" on the back of a word and call it a day.\n\nNow, going back to this idea of economic incentives, OpenAI's are designed at least to be a little different than others. The company started in 2015 as a nonprofit, but in 2019 created a for-profit vehicle as well. In a recent interview with Lex Fridman, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said:\n\n\"We had tried and failed enough to raise the money as a nonprofit. We didn’t see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism, but not too much. I remember at the time, someone said, you know, as a nonprofit, not enough will happen. As a for profit, too much will happen. So we need this sort of strange intermediate.\"\n\nPart of that \"strange intermediate\" was capping returns at 100x for early investors (the cap has gotten lower for later investors). On the one hand, 100x doesn't seem like too bad a return. On the other hand, AGI (assuming, you know, we live) probably returns a hell of a lot more than 100x.\n\nWhich is why so many other companies are racing at it with far less caution and consideration (and frankly, far more money). In that environment, even with the lead OpenAI has, can this vision of Medium Capitalism win?\n\nRead and subscribe to The AI Breakdown Newsletter -https://lnkd.in/gTpyzgXm",

Jon Benjamin.\n\nPlus, I was able to organically grow my social media accounts:\n- 60% Instagram to 377,174\n- 3.6% TikTok to 316,577\n- 113% YouTube 54,741\n- 363% Reddit to 29,000\n- 113% Facebook to 3,075\n\nAs 2025 starts, I am looking forward to producing another season of award winning training vids and taking Sandwiches of History: LIVE! on the road to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Boston, New Orleans, Nashville, and Washington D.C. (also working on Atlanta, Cleveland, Austin, London, Dublin, and maybe even somewhere in Germany).\n\nTo kick things off this year, I was lucky to be a guest on WBUR Boston’s Endless Thread podcast.

Everything from instruction on how to open the mailer without tearing apart the return envelope (seems obvious now but trust me, it was not at the time) to what to do if a DVD had issues.\n\nIt would be all to easy to look at that work now and think of it as wasted effort. But it wasn't at all. Not only did we help with customer retention (an by way of the eye-catching red mailer customer acquisition, see also word of mouth), it was one of the ways I learned, via consumer research, how to approach customer communication both visually and verbally. I gained experience learning about operations (which was impressive!). I got to work on ad integration in the mailer and co-branding with movie studios. And I worked closely with colleagues who helped shape what it meant to work in a high performance culture many who are still friends to this day.\n\nWhile it is a it sad to see the service shut down, it was always going to happen. It had a very good run.\n\nBy the way, the photos in this article are clearly lit to evoke a mood about the service and thus these job coming to an end.

When streaming launched in 2007, the world was surprised that a \"DVD company\" would even dare try something like streaming. But by that point we'd been working on it for years. Then the strategy shifted to one of device ubiquity. And in seemingly short order, Netflix was pre-installed on gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, and smart TVs. The remotes that came with them even had a Netflix button. And even while that was happening, the next strategic shift, to original content, was being worked on. \n\nAs someone who still owns and enjoys their Instant Pot it bums me out that the company (acquired in 2019 by Cornell Capital) is now filing for bankruptcy (and not just because we have to endure all kinds of \"meh\" level cooking metaphors in news reports).

But for decades, the name HBO has implied high quality original programming (btw, I'd bet that practically no one under the age of 50 thinks of it as \"Home Box Office\" anymore). The brand equity of that name is pretty remarkable built by decades of quality original content. Heck, it was the benchmark Netflix used when it launched it's originals ('the goal is for us to be more like HBO before HBO is more like us'). It would seem that the HBO brand would provide a halo effect for the newer content.\n\nSo, either Warner Bros. Discovery have done extensive consumer research and learned that the HBO name just doesn't carry much weight (which could be true) or they think they know that this is \"what the people really want.\" Time will tell. \n\n#brand #hbomax #streaming #netflix"

The result is over one million followers, millions of views on many of their videos, and a very positive brand impression for an entire generation who wouldn't have even glanced at regular ad. \n\nSure, Lenovo sells direct to consumer, but their main goals here are more about reach (✅) and brand (✅).

One that was designed to allow the company to remain agile as it scaled and I'd say that while I was there it allowed the company to punch well above it's weight. \n\nUnfortunately, without that underlying culture, the concept becomes open to all kinds of issues from employees abusing it to companies not actually letting them have any real time off.

Since then I have not been able to exercise whilst regulating my heart with aggressive medication and still with the prospect of open heart surgery. \n\nAfter being a keen runner / cyclist for many years, not being able to get out there on a regular basis has been messing with my mental health. \n\nAnyway I couldn’t stand it any more, so when I saw that the mental health charity Mind were doing a 300 mile sponsored bike ride in September I signed up to give me something to aim for. \n\nAnd I am so glad that I did. Firstly, it has completely reignited my love of cycling. Secondly, the physical benefits are clear (I feel much fitter and am sleeping better). And finally, my mental health has improved dramatically (as we all know mental and physical health work together in unison). \n\nIn the past week alone I have done 130 training miles and although I think I may need a new perineum and the hills seem a lot steeper than they used to be, I am loving every mile and every minute. \n\nSome people have said to me that I must be mad risking my heart health by taking up the challenge but I have checked with my cardiologist and she has said that as long as I don’t overdo it then I should be absolutely fine. And if I am not? Well I would rather die doing something that I absolutely love (for the record I also wouldn’t mind shuffling off my mortal coil watching football or in the throes of passion… though not necessarily on that order… and indulging in any of these activities is surely a better way out of here than just watching Netflix?!).\n\nBut anyway I digress, the real point of this post is to ask you a simple question. If you had the chance to buy me a coffee and have a quick chat, would you? \n\nWell that may not be totally practicable given the limitations of geography and availability but what if we could have a virtual coffee / chat instead?\n\nSo here is what I propose… if you make a charitable donation to Mind for the price of a coffee (let's say just a few pounds or dollars) on my JustGiving page for the Mind 300 Mile Bike Challenge in September 2022 then in return I promise to have a virtual chat with you on any topic you wish (work related or otherwise). \n\nYou will also be helping a brilliant mental health charity who are committed to helping people who are struggling with anxiety and depression which, in turn, is helping to save lives. \n\nAnd if just 1 in 100 of my Followers participate in the coffee / chat offer we could collectively raise over £60,000 for Mind - a win for everyone. And if not, then why not consider signing up yourself? \n\n#mentalhealth #work #people #cycling #charity #mind #health #love #mindfulness #linkedin #followers",

    "Brian de Haaff's post 1mo ago": "Many years ago, a manager pulled me aside after a meeting.\n\nShe shared that I was a good listener and respected my colleagues' opinions even when they were off. However, I often had the right perspective — but waited too long to share it (and usually well after bad ideas were gaining momentum).\n\nShe wanted me to start speaking first and listening later. So, I pushed myself to break the pattern. While continuing to do so respectfully. \n\nIf I had a point to make, I spoke up earlier. I would explain my point of view, how I came to it, and what I saw as the pros and cons. \n\nI notice that many other people have a hard time boldly presenting their perspectives and ideas in a group setting, even when they have something good to share. \n\nThis reticence is usually more common if senior leaders are in attendance, like when the CTO joins a product team meeting. \n\nIt takes a bit of effort to grow your confidence in this area, but you can practice over time. This is how I did it: https://lnkd.in/ga4WsTcS",

But they learned something critical: Feedback — even hard feedback — improves outcomes. I have come to seek it out from trusted colleagues and customers, especially when making difficult decisions.\n\nHere is how I approach feedback now:\n1. Listen without reacting. Imagine you are floating above the scene. Focus on understanding the sharer's perspective rather than preparing your defense.\n2. Ask clarifying questions. What am I missing? How could I make this approach better?\n3. Take time to reflect. Feedback often reveals gaps or opportunities you might not have seen.\n4. Apply what resonates. Not all feedback will be actionable, but the best often challenges you to think differently.\n\nFeedback is not about personal judgment — it is about improving outcomes for everyone involved. When you see it this way, you start to actively seek it rather than avoid it.",

That level of dysfunction is bigger than an office building. \n\nMismanagement, unclear goals, no transparency into work, lack of urgency: These are the real culprits.\n\nIn my experience, remote work gives you the opportunity to be your best from anywhere. \n\nAnd after more than a decade of leading a remote company, I still believe it is the best way to achieve. It was a critical component of our rapid success and remains so for our continued growth. \n\nMy advice to those who want to set a strong foundation for a remote (fully or hybrid) model is to give folks the tools they need to achieve. To work well, you need a way to work — regardless of where you are doing it. \n\nHere is what I suggest to leaders: \n\n1. Create the culture: Culture becomes something that belongs to everyone and motivates teammates to contribute in a meaningful way. \n\n2. Do it your way: A distinguishing factor of great companies is that there is a pre-defined way of working that everyone follows — a clear path forward with no time wasted on pondering how to do the work. \n\n3. Share information: I am always surprised by how many people tell me that there is little to no documentation or shared plans at their organization. Every team needs a playbook for success.\n\n4. Gather together: Bonding leads to trust, which leads to better collaboration. This is why I suggest that all remote teams get everyone together in person a few times a year to create social connections.\n\n5. Never stop improving: You will get it wrong sometimes. Model your dedication to continually improving by actively seeking out feedback from the team. \n\nI wrote about this in more detail here: https://lnkd.in/gacbN7-r\n\nWhat else would you add?\n\n#RemoteWork #Leadership",

    "Brian de Haaff's post 9mo ago": "Aha! has never directly shared our framework for how we build software. \n\nIt is not because we are secretive. We share most information freely and never gate content. \n\nIt is more that Aha! serves a diverse group of product builders (more than 1 million users and counting). So our focus has always been on providing supportive guidance and the right tools — no matter how people work.\n\nYet most of the product leaders I speak with are increasingly frustrated with current software development methodologies and are trying to set better standards. \n\nKanban- and scrum-based approaches often shortchange strategy. And SAFe (and other more comprehensive methodologies) bog teams down in process. \n\nSo after thousands of conversations over the last decade with folks who are trying to bring a more strategic approach to agile work, we knew it was time to make our way known. \n\nThe Aha! Framework for product development is something that our team has been testing, refining, and benefitting from for years. It is how we bring our own products to life. \n\nAnd we are now sharing it with you in a few ways.\n\nToday, we launched the ability to create and work off of frameworks in Aha! Roadmaps. There are templates for popular agile methods such as scrum and SAFe, but also one for The Aha! Framework. (You can make your own templates too.)\n\nCheck out the new frameworks here: https://lnkd.in/gURgfRQi\n\nThe team also put together an in-depth overview of The Aha! Framework in our guide for product managers, which you can read here: https://lnkd.in/gQFexC5j\n\nAnd finally, I am sharing a bit more of the \"why\" behind our ways in this blog post I wrote: https://lnkd.in/gZQQUwap\n\n#ProductDevelopment #TheAhaFramework",

And through that process often comes new discoveries, unexpected learnings, and true transformation.\n\nA pact should also be a PACT:\n\nPurposeful: It should feel exciting and provide meaning through the learning journey itself.\n\nActionable: It should be based on actions you can reliably perform, and be doable with your current resources.\n\nContinuous: It should be simply and repeatable, whether it’s every day, every weekend, or every week.\n\nTrackable: Not measurable, but trackable with a simple question: Have you done it or not, yes or no?\n\nSome examples from Le Cunff on pacts you can try, or that can inspire you to create your own:\n\nI will code every day for 100 days.\nI will write every weekday for the next six months.\nI will run every Sunday for the next six weeks.\n\nCheck out my column today in Inc. which explains more about why pacts are so valuable, my personal story of how a pact impacted me, and how you can design your own pact.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Do you like the idea of the pact?

    "Justin Bariso's post 3w ago": "How would you feel if you got \"fired\" from a job that you loved?\n\nThat's basically what happened to basketball superstar Luka Doncic, who the Dallas Mavericks traded to the L.A. Lakers in exchange for former Lakers big man Anthony Davis, in what many have called the most shocking trade in NBA history. Doncic is a generational talent who loved playing in Dallas—and, at 25, likely has not yet hit his prime.\n\nThere have been tons of stories about why Luka got traded, and who won the trade. (Most say L.A. came out the clear winners; others say the trade was good for both teams.) But what has gotten somewhat lost in everything is this:\n\nLuka is hurt. Not physically, but emotionally.\n\nLuka isn't *just* a basketball savant. He's a young man who, like everyone else, has real feelings and emotions. \n\nAnd, according to him, although excited about playing with his hero LeBron James in L.A., Luka got blindsided by this trade, and struggled with leaving Dallas, which he considered \"home.\" \n\nWell, last night the Lakers played the Mavericks, and Doncic and the Lakers came out on top. After the game, it seemed like reporters were all asking Doncic variations on the same question.\n \n“What were the emotions like going into this game?”\n\nDoncic acknowledged this was far from just another game.\n\nHe described it as “weird,” “different,” and said he couldn’t even explain the emotions he was dealing with as he saw close friends, teammates with whom he’s “been through wars together.”\n\nThen, in a few short words, Doncic shared something especially poignant, insightful, and deep.\n\n“The closure is going to take a while, I think,” Doncic replied. “It’s not ideal…There were a lot of emotions, but we go little by little.”\n\n“And every day is better.”\n\nThere’s a great lesson here in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, namely, this: \n\nLosing something important to you hurts. Moving on is a process, and it’s best handled one step at a time.\n\nTo dig deeper into this lesson, and learn more about how to use emotional intelligence to deal with negative emotions, check out today's column.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Have you ever experienced something similar?

    "Justin Bariso's post 1mo ago": "\"I take all the blame.\"\n\nThat's what Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes said last night after his team lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. It was one of the worst blowouts in Super Bowl history.\n\nAnd it was a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence. Here's why.\n\nMahomes was responsible for his share of mistakes, including two big ones in the second quarter. He threw two interceptions, both which resulted in touchdowns and left the Chiefs trailing the Eagles: 24-0.\n\nAfter the game, Mahomes could have tried to shift the blame. \n\nHe could have talked about how hard it is to complete passes when you’re getting chased by large men who want to punish you like you stole something from them. (The Chiefs offensive line allowed the Eagles to sack Mahomes six times, the most in his career.) \n\nOr, he could have blamed the refs, as he has famously done in the past.\n\nBut he didn’t.\n\n“Credit to the Eagles, man,” Mahomes said in his post game press conference. “They played better than us from start to finish.”\n\n“Obviously the turnovers hurt,” Mahomes continued. “I take all the blame for that...It’s hard to come back from that in a Super Bowl.\"\n\nOver and over, Mahomes put the blame on himself.\n\n“I can’t turn the ball over early in the game when it’s not going our way,” Mahomes said.\n\n“I’ll have to learn from that and try to be better the next opportunity that I hopefully get,” Mahomes said.\n\n“Hopefully we can learn from this…and try to continue to get even better because it’s going to take better football, especially from me in order to try to make a run at another Super Bowl,” Mahomes said.\n\nWith these words, Mahomes did more than take ownership of the loss. He taught a brilliant lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nWhy are Mahomes' comments so remarkable? And what can you learn from them that will help you in business and life? \n\nCheck out the answers in today's column. (Link in the comments.)\n\n***\n\nWhat do YOU think: When you play the blame game, you're the only one who loses.

It'll be followed by another ad post-game, informing Starbucks Rewards members that they can get a free tall iced or hot coffee on the following day (Monday).\n\nThat’s all great news if you’re a Starbucks fan. \n\nBut let’s say you’ve never been a Starbucks fan…or, that you’re one of the many former fans who feel the coffee company lost its way over the years.\n\nWell, there’s a good chance this new ad will speak to you.\n\nThe ad is set to the song “Thunderstruck” by rock group AC/DC.\n\nIt opens with a Starbucks barista opening a store in early morning darkness...\n\nBaristas smile, laugh, and dance as they work. \n\nCustomers smile and dance with their kids as they pick up their orders. \n\nThe message of the ad is short and punchy. The voiceover artist’s delivery is poetic.\n\nThe whole thing is quite…emotional. \n\nStrike that. \n\nIt’s emotionally intelligent.\n\nEmotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Like general intelligence, emotional intelligence is often thought of in terms of solving a problem or achieving a goal.\n\nThat’s what makes this ad so great.\n\nIt’s designed, not so much to inform, but to touch you on an emotional level. \n\nStarbucks wants to remind you of who it once was, why its customers skyrocketed them from another small coffee chain to the biggest coffeehouse on the planet.\n\nIt wants to make you feel good about Starbucks, so that you’re ready to give it a shot. Or, another shot, depending on your experience with the brand. And they’re making it as easy as possible to do by giving away free coffee.\n\nThe goal? If you watch the ad and come in for a coffee, you’ll either create or rekindle a positive relationship with Starbucks.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway for you?\n\nIf you run a company or a marketing team, it’s easy to get lost in the complexity of communicating many things. \n\nInterestingly, though, Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks' Global Chief Brand Officer, says the new Starbucks ad started with a simple directive: \n\n“Celebrate what makes Starbucks, Starbucks.”\n\nSimple is best: Focus on how you make the customer feel. \n\nThen, give them a chance to build on that experience.\n\nDo this right, and you’ll inspire new and former customers alike to give you a shot. \n\nAnd if you deliver on your promise, you’ll be building a brand that customers love.\n\n(Check out today's column in the comments.)\n\n***\n\nAre you a current or former Starbucks fan? Would this ad make you give the brand another shot?\n\nI look forward to reading your comments.\n\n#starbucks #marketing #emotionalintelligence #leadership #management #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

A few minutes earlier I had walked into Starbucks and ordered a Brown Sugar Oat Milk Cortado, my new go-to drink. I thought I had indicated I wanted the drink for here, as I was planning to get some work done over the next few hours and wanted a nice mug to sip from.\n\n But as I got the drink in a “to-go” cup, it became obvious there was a miscommunication.\n\n“Umm, if possible,” I replied.\n\nThe barista let out a silent sigh. I felt bad to make her redo the drink. On the other hand, I had just paid $5 for a coffee. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the interaction left both of us with a bitter taste in our mouths.\n \nWell, it looks like Starbucks is trying to fix that.\n\nHere’s what the company recently announced on its company website:\n\n“Starting January 27, when you order any beverage ‘for here’ it will be served in a coffee mug, glass, or in your clean personal cup brought from home. During your visit to that cafe, you will also be able to enjoy free refills of hot brewed or iced coffee, or hot or iced tea.”\n\nCeramic mugs and free refills? Sign me up.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a small change. But let me assure you, it’s not—and the reasons why are about much more than trying to reduce waste. Rather, it’s rooted in concepts of emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions to achieve a positive result. \n\n(Read more in today's column, along with the takeaways for you and your business.)\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think about Starbucks' change?

And it’s founded on concepts of emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions in pursuit of a goal.\n\nWhat does “tough, detailed, together” mean to the Eagles?

    "Justin Bariso's post 2mo ago": "Are you using positive self-talk to will big moments into existence? \n\nIf not, you might want to take a lesson from Philadelphia Eagles Running Back Saquon Barkley.\n\nYesterday, the Eagles punched their ticket to next week’s NFC Championship Game. A big part of the win was the performance of Eagles Running Back Saquon Barkley, who rushed for 205 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAfter the game, a reporter asked Barkley about a key play, a 4th quarter, 78-yard touchdown run through falling snow that put the Eagles up for good.\n\n“Before, I closed my eyes and talked to Jody our therapist, kind of got in my own little mantra,” Barkley replied. “It’s cool when you work on exercises like that. Tell yourself, this is the moment, and it happens.”\n\nWith this statement, Barkley reveals a secret emotionally intelligent technique that high performers use to motivate themselves and increase performance. In psychology, this technique is known as “positive self-talk.”\n\nBy developing short, encouraging phrases to be used in the moment, you can positively influence the way you think, feel, and act. \n\nFor example, in my emotional intelligence practice I teach clients to use the following phrases:\n\n-“Use the difficulty” (to overcome adversity)\n-“Work in progress” (to beat perfectionism)\n-“Run the experiment” (to stop overthinking and move forward)\n-“They don’t know” (to ignore hurtful comments and avoid distraction)\n-“Seek discomfort” (to build mental strength and resilience)\n\nWant to learn more about the benefits of positive self-talk and how to use it?

Besides the fact that it's hilarious,  touching, and extremely realistic, I often use episodes to teach emotional intelligence lessons. (Before last year's season finale, my favorite was \"Bike.\" IYKYK.)\n\nThis news was bittersweet, though. Although Bluey creator Joe Brumm will be heavily involved in the film, he said he's actually stepping away from the series for the time being. \n\nIn other words: No new Bluey episodes anytime soon.\n\nWhy is that? As Brumm explained in an open letter:\n\n“I always said I wouldn’t keep making the show if I thought I couldn’t make any new season as good as the last,” Brumm wrote. “This would have been the case for me with a potential season four, so I’ve decided to take a break from my involvement in the TV series. In the event I can’t wrap my head around doing more seasons myself, 'The Sign' will mark my TV finale for Bluey and I wrote it as such.”\n\n(BTW, If you haven't see \"The Sign,\" I highly recommend you watch. It's a master class in storytelling, and literally a perfect episode.)\n\nBrumm says that walking away from the series at its height “will seem crazy to some.” But he added that he was finding it difficult to continue to write authentically in the “four to six year old world.”\n\nIf you run a creator business, there's a huge lesson here if your tank runs dry, if the ideas aren’t coming as quickly as they used to, or if, like Brumm, your work isn’t reaching the quality you want.\n\nWhen that time comes, consider keeping the fire alive by:\n\n-Taking a break\n-Working on other projects for a while\n-Changing something about your work (the format, the platform, the audience)\n\nDoing so can help breathe new life into your work.\n\nAnd while I'll miss 'Bluey' the show, I can't wait to see what's next.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n💬 Comment and share your thoughts\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more EQ tips & tools\n\n#emotionalintelligence #productivity #creativity #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Once it’s gone, it’s gone.\n\nResearch shows that when you take time for others, everyone benefits.\n\nFor example, Gallup discovered that employees whose managers held regular meetings with them were almost three times as likely to be engaged at work than counterparts who had no regular meetings. (Employees who had daily communication with their managers were most engaged.)\n\nOf course, this type of investment takes time. But it’s time well spent.\n\nWhat about our personal lives?\n\nIn a study conducted by psychologists at the University of Zurich, participants were assigned to meet up with three people they cared about in the course of a week, to give them a “gift of time.” (The gift needed to be more than the time they would normally spend with each person). \n\nWhen compared with another group who wrote about their memories in a daily journal, the “time-givers” reported greater happiness. The longer they continued the practice, the more happiness they reported.\n\nSo, this week, why don’t you plan your own gift of time? \n\nSimply:\n\n1️⃣ Pick a person you’d like to give some time to; then\n2️⃣ Plan to do something with that person.\n\nIt could be:\n\n💡 Inviting someone for a meal, or even just for ☕ \n👋 A surprise visit\n☀️ Meeting for a walk outside\n🖥️ A virtual call \n🥳 A morning or afternoon off to spend together\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind...\n\nYou hardly remember the time you spend alone. But you definitely remember the time you spend with others. \n\nMeaning, by simply sharing your time with others, you make an investment:\n\nYou’re creating memories for the future.\n\nSo, remember:\n\nTime is the most precious resource you have. Spend it wisely by sharing it with others.\n\nBecause once time is gone, you’re never getting it back.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n💬 Comment and share your thoughts\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more emotional intelligence tips & tools\n\nThanks to the very talented Roberto Ferraro for the image!\n\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

It's saved me more times than I can count.\n\nI learned the 3-Question Rule from comedian Craig Ferguson, who once quipped...\n\nBefore you say ANYTHING, you have to ask yourself three questions:\n\n1. Does this need to be said?\n2. Does this need to be said by me?\n3. Does this need to be said by me, now?\n\nFerguson says it took him three marriages to learn that lesson 😂 \n\nTruthfully, though, I LOVE this tool because it's helped me:\n\n-stop talking so much\n-avoid saying things I regret\n-give others the chance to speak\n-say things at the right time\n-speak up with confidence (when the answer to all three questions is \"yes\")\n\nOf course, this question doesn't work for everyone. If you're naturally shy or find yourself holding back by default, I recommend another question:\n\n\"Will I regret *not* saying this later?\"\n\nThis question can help you say what you want to say, when you need to say it.\n\nSo...if you're looking for a tool to help you:\n\n-Save yourself from saying things you later regret\n-Increase the value of what you say\n-Speak with more confidence\n\nTry the 3-Question Rule today. \n\nThen, write me back and tell me how it goes.\n\n\n❓for you: What do you think about the 3-Question Rule?

Thinking things through is good.\n\nBut overthinking is bad because:\n\n-Life rarely plays out exactly the way you’ve imagined it. \n\n-You spend hours, days, even months or years worrying about things that will never happen.\n\n-It paralyzes you and prevents you from moving forward.\n\nIn contrast, when you run the experiment, you take this approach:\n\n\"I'm not sure of the right way. But I won't know unless I make a decision.\n\n\"So, let's pick one. If it works out great, awesome. If not, I'll have more data and can adjust—or, will know what to do next time.\"\n\nThere are very few irreversible decisions. When you run the experiment, you choose to move forward, rather than standing still. \n\nAnd since time is money, standing still often costs more than changing your mind.\n\nAs you run more and more experiments, you'll get into a repeated cycle of:\n\n-think\n-decide\n-test\n-learn\n-adjust\n\nThat tight feedback loop will help you make better and better decisions over time.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself overthinking, take a step back and...\n\nRun the experiment.\n\nBecause the more experiments you run, the better decisions you’ll make.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more emotional intelligence tools\n\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Someone unique, someone who would stand out. But Miyamoto was limited by game hardware and software at the time.\n\nTo make this small character look more human, Miyamoto gave him a big nose. He added a mustache so there was no need to draw a mouth or show facial expressions, and a hat so the character’s hair wouldn’t need to be animated when he jumped. The high contrast red overalls and blue shirt completed the look.\n\nYes—Mario, the most famous video game character of all time, was the product of working within constraints.\n\nThis teaches a great lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions:\n\nConstraints, while limiting, can breed innovation—if you change the way you view them.\n\nCheck out more examples, and how you can change the way YOU view constraints, in today's column.

But it's close. \n\nWhat's the trick?\n\nWriting by hand.\n\nWhen you write by hand (journal), you're forced to slow down and think about what you're writing. Research shows this promotes more elaborate brain connectivity, which is crucial for memory formation, encoding new information, and learning.\n\nIn other words, the process of writing not only allows you to clarify thoughts, it helps you “internalize” them—making them a part of you.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t happen instantaneously as in the movies. \n\nBut over time you'll find journaling like this helps you remember and practice what you learn. \n\nYes, it takes time and repeated practice to see the benefits.

    "Justin Bariso's post 3mo ago": "Is empathy good or bad? \n\nThe answer may surprise you.\n\nI’ve been told I’m a very empathetic person. I always considered that a strength...\n\nAnd it is, if kept in balance.\n\nDon't get me wrong—I think we need more empathy in the world. Empathy helps us to understand and relate to others.\n\nBut here's the thing: If you leave your empathy unchecked, it'll take a heavy toll. That's because you can't really turn empathy \"off.\" \n\nWhen others pour out their hearts to me, I take it all in. Unable to turn off my feelings, I’m often left feeling emotionally drained. And I'm not alone.\n\nResearch shows that nurses who work with terminally ill patients run a high risk of developing \"compassion fatigue,\" a condition of physical and emotional depletion. It’s easy for caregivers like these to focus on the needs of their patients at the expense of their own, putting them on a path to burnout.\n\nWe can compare empathy to a muscle. Used in the right way, it allows you to “lift” others up and even help carry their burdens. But like any muscle, it can become overworked.\n\nThe key, then, is to develop emotionally intelligent empathy—balanced empathy that works for you, instead of against you.\n\nHow can you exercise your empathy muscle in an emotionally intelligent way?\n\nA few tips: \n\n1. Give yourself buffer time.\nIf your job involves being around others much of the day, you may quickly find yourself emotionally exhausted.\n\nTo combat this, schedule buffer time between meetings or time with others. Take shorter, more frequent breaks that allow you to recharge your emotional batteries.\n\n2. Set boundaries.\nIf you're spending time with someone who you know needs more than usual attention, set a time limit. You might even make an appointment that you have to meet at a certain time—even if it's an appointment with yourself.\n\nOf course, you don't want to rush away...but recognize that if every time you're with them you overspend your emotional budget, you'll probably start avoiding them altogether.\n\nYour empathy muscle can be a major source of strength—but only if you don’t work it to the point of breakdown.\n\nSo, work to understand your own emotional needs; then, act accordingly. \n\nThat's that's emotionally intelligent empathy—empathy that helpful, instead of harmful.\n\n***\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever overworked your empathy muscle?

Redick, and Lakers legend Magic Johnson used to describe the team's two recent blowout losses.\n\nWhich brings us to a question: \n\nHow do YOU deal with embarrassment?\n\nOf course, nobody likes to experience negative emotions like embarrassment...but they can be useful if you channel them the right way.\n\nAs Redick correctly identified in his postgame press conference, the tendency after a couple of losses like this is for the team to splinter, to start going through the motions. They might just show up for work, rather than continue to strive to work together as a team, with a shared vision and shared goals. \n\nRedick’s job is to identify how to make it the latter, rather than the former.\n\nWhat's the takeaway for you? \n\nWhen you suffer embarrassment, accept it. Process it. Then, use that negative feeling to motivate you to action: to identify what factors led to the embarrassment, to develop a plan to deal with those factors, and then to start working to implement that plan. \n\nI'm personally hopeful Redick will figure it out, as I'm a fan of his approach to the game. After all, it's a long season...and the team's just getting started.\n\n\nWhat do YOU think? \n\nCan embarrassment ever be a good thing? If so, how can you leverage it for a positive result?

I've read tons of these through the years, including from the likes of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and Disney CEO Bob Iger. \n\nThis is the most impressed I've been.  \n\nThe clarity of vision, the extreme focus, and the detailed actions in support of that focus are excellent. \n\nNiccol's strategy all starts with four words:\n\n\"Four minutes or less.\"\n\nIn today's column, I talk about why that focus is so smart, and how Niccol plans to use it as Starbucks' \"North Star\" for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat do you think: Were you as impressed with Niccol's plan as I was?

But after missing his first couple of attempts…\n\nHe got booed.\n\nIn reply, Wilson went on to throw for 264 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Steelers record for most passing yards in a debut. He and the team put up 37 points on their way to victory.\n\nAfter the game, a reporter asked Wilson how he stayed steady despite the boos and chants to be replaced by Wilson’s backup, Justin Fields.\n\n“I really believe in being neutral,” said Wilson. “Not being too high, not being too low.”\n\nIf Wilson’s answer sounds familiar, it should. (He’s been saying it for years.)\n\nBut this philosophy is more than a sound bite, it’s a brilliant lesson in resilience—a hallmark quality of emotional intelligence.

Instead of offering discounts, the company has been offering more bonuses, like extra loyalty points. Additionally, in a recent strategy update, Starbucks told store leaders it will now focus on promoting seasonal drinks (think of the ubiquitous “Pumpkin Spice Latte”).\n\nThis change in strategy is brilliant for several reasons, including the following:\n\n1. You just don’t discount premium.\n2. You have to reward your most loyal customers.\n3. Deadlines increase urgency (and sales).\n\nThis strategy  shows evidence of Niccol’s business acumen, who's a rockstar in the restaurant industry.\n\nOf course, depending on which type of Starbucks customer you are, you’ll either love or hate this change. \n\n(For the full story, check out today's column.)\n\n#starbucks #leadership #management #strategy #branding #brianniccol",

    "Justin Bariso's post 5mo ago": "What would you do if you were criticized by a teammate after a big mistake?\n\nThat’s the situation Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott faced last night. \n\nPrescott was in the middle of a hard-fought game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he had just thrown a disheartening interception at the goal line.\n\nAfterwards, Cowboys Wide Receiver CeeDee Lamb, the intended receiver of Prescott’s pass, could be seen hurtling a comment in his quarterback’s direction. I reached out to professional lip reader Nicola HICKLING, founder of LipReader. According to Hickling, it appears Lamb is saying: “Some ball control, come on.”\n\nOther online sleuths, though, thought Lamb was trying to encourage Prescott, saying: “Jump balls four. Jump balls, I got you.” (“Four” is Prescott’s jersey number.)\n\nRegardless of what Lamb really said, Prescott’s reply was brilliant: He simply looked down at the field in silence.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nBoth teams exchanged leads as the game went on. But on the Cowboys final play, 4th down and goal with less than 30 seconds to go, Prescott delivered a perfect touchdown pass.\n\nIt turned out to be the game winner.\n\nFor some, Prescott’s silence earlier in the game may not seem like much. But it’s actually a perfect case study in how to use a remarkable tool of emotional intelligence, one that can help you to become resilient in the face of adversity, and to make better decisions after big mistakes:\n\nThe pause.\n\nWhat is the pause? Why is it so valuable? And how can you use it effectively?

There's a lot of wisdom in it.\n\nIt shows the value of looking to the past to learn from mistakes—both our own, and those of others.\n\nBut it also emphasizes that you can't get stuck in the past. Rather, each day brings with it new opportunities. \n\nEmotional intelligence (EQ), the ability to understand and manage emotions, includes learning how to not get caught up in the moment, which can lead to us make an emotional decision we later regret.\n\nBut emotional intelligence ALSO involves being able to tap into your emotions—to leverage your feelings, learn from the past, and apply those learnings to the future.\n\nSo, ask yourself:\n\n-What can I learn from MY past?\n-What mistakes am I repeating over and over, without even thinking?\n-What am I doing now that I'll regret if I don't change?\n-What am I NOT doing now, that I really want to start?\n\nThe answers can help you start to make emotions work for you, not against you.\n\nAnd that's emotional intelligence at its best.\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

And Starbucks founder and former CEO Howard Schultz wasn't happy, sharing his displeasure in an open letter on LinkedIn criticizing the company's direction and leadership.\n\nSo, in July, the board started a conversation about a potential change in leadership. Soon after this, Hobson says she reached out to Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol through a third party.\n\n\"We thought we had the opportunity to engage with one of the biggest names in the industry,\" Hobson told CNBC. \"He knows this industry, and we thought he would be the right leader for this moment.\"\n\nNiccol took the call. And Hobson says she clearly remembers what Niccol told her when they spoke.\n\n\"I know what to do,\" Hobson says Niccol told him. \"This is a speed bump in this company's history. This is not something I fear going into.\"\n\n\"I know what to do.\"\n\nThose five words aren't just confident, they're emotionally intelligent—because they helped convince Hobson, and likely Starbucks' board, that Niccol was the right person for the job. The biggest reason why? Because Niccol had the track record to back his words up.\n\n(Read more about what convinced Starbucks to hire its new CEO—and how to build your own emotional intelligence—in today's column on Inc.)\n\n#starbucks #leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

A big part of that success is due to the play of Celtics superstar Jayson Taytum; interestingly, though, Taytum’s scoring is down significantly. \n\nIn the regular season, Taytum averaged almost 27 points per game; in these first two games of the finals, he’s scored 16 and 18 points, respectively. But Taytum is doing other things his team may need even more: His assists and rebounds, for example, are up from his season averages.\n\nIn last night’s postgame press conference, a reporter asked Taytum about this change. His answer was insightful.\n\n“I’ve been here before [in the finals] and we didn’t win,” Taytum replied. “We’re so close to what we’re trying to accomplish. Why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points get in the way of that?”\n\nTaytum continued:\n\n“We always talk about, ‘do whatever it takes, for however long it takes.’ And if I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that’s what puts us in the best position to win…sign me up.”\n\nDo whatever it takes, for however long it takes.\n\nThis nine word philosophy is much more than a great sound bite, it’s a lesson in emotionally intelligent leadership.

But in a post on social media platform “X,” Carter referenced what happened on the previous play, in which Clark slapps the ball away from Carter and then appears to yell at her afterwards.\n\nClark, on the other hand, did address the play.\n\n“I wasn’t expecting that,” Clark said after the game. “But I think it’s just like, ‘Respond, calm down, and let your play do the talking.’”\n\nRespond, calm down, and let your play do the talking.\n\nThat’s exactly what Clark did. Following the foul, she was able to sink the corresponding free throw. And that one point ended up being exactly what the Fever needed to defeat the Sky, 71-70.\n\nClark’s 10-word reply is more than a great sound bite, it’s a mini master class in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from Clark’s reply? And how can you apply these lessons to your own work life? \n\nTo answer those questions, let's take a look at what happens inside the brain in a moment like this, and what you can do to manage that response. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#leadership #management #CaitlinClark #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

And you'll be building an emotionally intelligent culture across your organization as a whole.\n \nWhy is this important? \n\nBecause according to research:\n \nEmotional Intelligence ranks as the number one leadership skill for 2024.\n \n83% of individuals with emotionally intelligent managers report high job satisfaction.\n \n95% of people think they’re self-aware, but only 10 to 15 percent actually are. Working with colleagues who aren’t self-aware can cut a team’s success in half and lead to increased stress and decreased motivation.\n \nLeaders who master empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, engaging others, and decision-making.\n \nSome prefer to avoid conflict, but every unaddressed conflict can waste about eight hours of company time in gossip and other unproductive activities, putting a drain on resources and morale.\n \nWhen Motorola provided training in emotional intelligence, 93% of employees had an increase in productivity.\n\n(Want the links to this research? Happy to send it to you, just DM me.)\n \nSo, if you want your team to perform better, work together better, and feel better, why not teach them The Rules of Emotional Intelligence?\n \nGet started today, and your whole team will be learning how to make emotions work for you, instead of against you.\n \nTalk soon,\nJustin\n\nPS: If you purchase The Rules of Emotional Intelligence for your team, I'll even provide a draft message telling your team the highlights of the course, along with login details, to help build excitement and ease the onboarding process.

O'Leary related the story of a class he taught a few years ago, when a student in the back raised his hand to ask a question.\n\nThe student had built a compliance cloud-based platform for hedge funds of $250 million and under, with a run rate (expected revenue) of $5 million per year, according to O'Leary.\n \nBut he was also conflicted.\n\n\"My girlfriend came to me today and said I have to make a decision,\" the student said. \"We're engaged, but she doesn't want to live this way. I have no time for her family; I have no time for her. I work every weekend. I work all night. What do I do? I don't want to lose her.\"\n\nO'Leary says you could have heard a pin drop as the entire class waited for an answer.\n\n\"Listen, let's be pragmatic about this,\" said O'Leary. \"Which one is easier to replace: Your business, or your fiancée?\"\n\nOuch.\n\nI'm often a fan of O'Leary's advice, but this answer is not only brutal, but it's also short-sighted. Put simply, it could lead the man to a decision he regrets for the rest of his life. \n\nIn contrast, a more emotionally intelligent approach could help this student make a decision that keeps logic and emotion in balance, leading to a decision he's confident in.\n\nHow could principles of emotional intelligence help in this situation? And how can they help you when you are faced with difficult, emotional decisions? \n\nRead the answers in today's column.\n\nAnd most importantly: What would you do???

Although the caller ID didn’t show a number, Gifford says she was certain it was Stern. She didn’t answer but Stern left a powerful message.\n\n“He was basically saying ‘I can’t believe how nice you were to me,’” Gifford relates. “’I just need to apologize to you. Please call me.’”\n\nIn a separate interview several years ago, Gifford said Stern told her he was angry at her because “you were everything I wasn’t.”\n\nBut there’s more to this story. It turns out, that day in the Today show studio wasn’t the first time Gifford reached out to Stern.\n\nAs we dive in deeper, let’s examine why Gifford’s actions teach a master class in emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to break down barriers and manage the emotions of others. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#leadership #management #EmotionalIntelligence #communication #persuasion #conflictmanagement #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 9mo ago": "I'm a 45-yr old father of four.\n\nFor years, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me. \n\nBut after 2500+ hours studying the psychology of emotional intelligence, I built a toolkit of frameworks to help me keep my cool and make better decisions during emotional moments.\n\nHere are 3 frameworks that'll change your life:\n\n1. The 3-Question Rule\n\nYears ago I was watching an interview with comedian Craig Ferguson. He made a funny but very insightful joke:\n\nThere are three things you must always ask yourself before you say anything:\n\n-Does this need to be said?\n-Does this need to be said by me?\n-Does this need to be said by me, now?\n\nFerguson quipped it took him three marriages to learn this lesson. \n\nBut all joking aside, I use this rule every day, and it's saved me more times than I can count.\n\n2. The Blue Dolphin Rule\n\nThe Blue Dolphin Rule is a solution to the \"White Bear Problem,\" also known as ironic process theory. \n\nThe problem was developed by Harvard psychologist Daniel Wegner and refers to a quote by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky:\n\n\"Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute.\"\n\nOver time, psychologists identified one of the most effective solutions to the white bear problem was to replace unwanted thoughts with desired thoughts. \n\nI call these desired thoughts \"Blue Dolphins.\"\n\nFor example, if you're getting nervous before a big presentation, you can replace disquieting thoughts with a more encouraging one: \n\nWhite Bear: \"I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.\"\n\nBlue Dolphin: \"I'm so excited. I've prepared well. This is going to go great.\"\n\n3. The Golden Question\n\nThe golden question is actually five questions in one. \n\nWhen you need to make a decision under pressure or stress, ask yourself:\n\nHow will I feel about this in:\n\n-a day?\n-a week?\n-a month?\n-a year?\n-5 years?\n\nThe Golden Question helps you keep things in perspective. AND it gives you a glimpse into the future—so you make better, more well-rounded decisions you don't later regret.\n\nWould you like 21 more frameworks like these? \n\nWant to drastically improve your emotional intelligence in just 24 days?\n\nFor the next 7 days, my course \"The Rules of Emotional Intelligence\" is on sale for $49 (normally $199).\n\nGet lifetime access to the psychology-based frameworks that have transformed my life—and that I've taught to thousands of persons across the world, including top executives, CEOs, coaches, and therapists. \n\nUse coupon code EQSPRING24 to get the discount. \n\nYou can learn more about the course here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/epWuYgRz",

Some were short, a minute or less. Others were not so short, even reaching up to five minutes--or longer.\n\nRecently, it seems this practice is going mainstream in the U.S. \"Burned out on screens, people are sending lengthy voice notes instead,\" reported the Washington Post last week. And this morning LinkedIn published a short article on \"The rise of the voice memo.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I used to hate on these types of messages. But over time, my opinion changed.\n \nPart of the reason for this is my work. As an emotional intelligence coach, I've spent thousands of hours researching, practicing, and helping others to better understand and manage their emotions. In doing so, I've grown to appreciate the value of voice messages.\n\nWhat advantages do voice messages offer over written messages, or phone or virtual calls? Are there times or situations when you shouldn't use a voice message? Let's discuss.\n\n***\nWhat about you: Are you a fan of the voice message? Why or why not? \n\nLook forward to reading your comments.\n\n#communication #voicememo #emotionalintelligence #leadership #management #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

He tried climbing and swinging between buildings, and fell flat on his face.\n\nOr how about in the story of Superman, when Clark Kent discovered X-ray vision and super-hearing for the first time--and got completely disoriented. \nIt's similar when building emotional intelligence.\n\nEmotions are powerful. Anger, sadness, and fear are all powerful emotions that can lead us to say or do things we later regret. Even so called positive emotions, like joy, can lead to regret if it causes us to agree to something because we're in a good mood, only to realize later we've over committed.\n\nBut those same emotions can be a force for good.\n\nFear can be paralyzing, but it can also motivate us to get away from a dangerous situation. \n\nSadness is painful, but it can help us to realign our priorities or to take action. \nAnd while a bad temper can ruin a relationship, controlled anger, displayed in the proper degree and in the right way, can inspire needed change.\n\nThat's why, once you start to develop it, you know: Emotional intelligence is a superpower.\n\nIn studying emotional intelligence for over a decade, I've seen firsthand how this ability gives persons a powerful edge. We could sum up the reason why in just seven words:\n\nEmotional Intelligence helps you see things differently.\n\nHow does emotional intelligence give you a different perspective from the rest of the world?

He had just watched the Minnesota Timberwolves defeat the Denver Nuggets in a grueling, seven game playoff series, earning the Timberwolves a spot in the NBA's Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe Timberwolves would be playing against Irving and the Mavericks. So, when Minnesota star player Anthony Edwards' was asked for his opinion on the upcoming series, Irving was all ears.\n\n\"My matchup [is] going to be Kyrie,\" Edwards said. \"So that's going to be fun. We're going to see what I can do versus him.\"\n\nOn the surface, these comments sound innocent. But they made up a soundbite that was the talk of the town in sports media and basketball circles over the next days. Many felt that the young but talented superstar Edwards was calling out the veteran Irving, implying he would limit Irving's effectiveness on the court.\n\nIrving's reply was, well...perfect.\n\nIn game one of the Western Conference Finals, Irving put on a masterful performance. His 30 points proved key to the underdog Mavericks defeating the Timberwolves.\n\nAfter the game, Irving was asked about Edwards comments.\n\n\"[I] used it as a motivation,\" Irving said. \"When I was sitting at home and I saw it, I was like, it's just a nod of respect...But also, that's a no-fear mentality, and that's why we love [Anthony Edwards].\"\n\nIrving's comments teach a master class in emotional intelligence, namely, in how to avoid taking offense in the comments of others, while still using those comments to provide motivation and focus.\n\nWhat are the biggest takeaways from Irving's response?

Jassy loved his role at Amazon, which had included running several areas of the company, including AWS (Amazon Web Services, the company's successful cloud computing division). He knew Bezos would be leaving big shoes to fill.\n\n\"I really wasn't thinking about that role,\" Jassy said. \"I was surprised and I was flattered, and I said, well, if it's ok I'd like to talk to my wife about it.\"\n\nJassy went on to relate that his wife and he spoke about the job offer over dinner. Most of the conversation that night consisted of his wife asking him deep, soul-searching questions, a few of which included:\n\n-Why do you want to do this job?\n-You love your current job...Do you feel you're done with it?\n-Are you sure?\n\nJassy says he didn't realize it at the time, but that conversation led him to a major discovery: He was ready for a different challenge. \n\nSoon after, he accepted the job.\n\nBoth Jassy and his wife's actions teach powerful lessons in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Let's break down three valuable takeaways from this story and see how you can apply them to your own business. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#amazon #management #emotionalintelligence #AndyJassy #linkedin #ryanroslansky #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

It was a Saturday night, but he was just hanging around the house, not doing anything special.\n\n\"Oh, man,\" he sighed. \"Do I have to? I just want to chill.\"\n\nI was silent. I wanted to be balanced...But I also wanted the two of us to spend time together. I took a few minutes to think. Suddenly, I had an epiphany.\n\n\"Yeah, you have to,\" I said. \"Come on, let's go.\"\n\nYou can imagine his mood when I forced him to come. But that mood would change when I shared the reason behind my decision.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said to my son. \"You know why I didn't let you stay at home?\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of this number,\" I replied.\n\nI showed him the calculator on my phone, which showed a seemingly random figure:\n\n364.\n\n\"Is that a big number?\" I asked my son.\n\n\"Well, it's one day short of a year,\" he replied.\n\n\"Yeah, that's true,\" I said. \"But there's something else.\"\n\nI sat for a minute, letting the silence settle in.\n\n\"That's very possibly the number of weekends we have left together,\" I said.\n\n\"You're about to be a teenager,\" I explained. \"Which means you've probably lived longer with your mom and I than you'll still live with us. I mean, who knows, right? If you leave home around the time that I did, that's about what we've got left.\"\n\n\"I want to spend as much time with you as I can,\" I continued. \"Because there's nothing I enjoy more than spending time with you and your sisters.\"\n\nIt took a while, but eventually my son cheered up. The evening was amazing: We talked, we laughed, we had a great time.\n\nThis story illustrates how to use a powerful tool of emotional intelligence, something I call the \"Calendar Rule.\"\n\nWhat exactly is the Calendar Rule?

Schultz says leaders need to \"model both humility and confidence,\" as they strive to restore trust and increase performance.\n\nBut take a moment to look beyond Schultz's analysis. Focus on the way he speaks about the brand, and a key insight emerges. \n\nFor example, see if you can identify just one word that stands out in the middle of Schultz's post. After highlighting that he no longer serves on the company's board of directors, and has had no formal role in Starbucks since last year, Schultz says the following:\n\n\"But my love of the company and all those who wear 'the cloth of the company'—the iconic green apron—knows no bounds.\"\n\nDid you catch the key word?\n\nLove.\n\nThere's no doubt Schultz truly loves Starbucks. The problem, though, is Starbucks continues to bring in outsiders to lead—and there's no way they can love Starbucks the way Schultz wants them to. \n\nThe lesson has to do with emotional intelligence, namely this: Starbucks needs more than a leader who knows how to run a global company.\n\nThey need a leader who truly loves Starbucks.\n\nTo prove this, let's dive into Starbucks' history. Then, we'll analyze the takeaway and see how you can apply it to your own business.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n\n#starbucks #management #emotionalintelligence #leadership #HowardSchultz #LinkedIn #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Or, they wanted to make more money, despite the grueling schedule it often took to do so.\n\nBut over time, the reason many persons pursue entrepreneurship and solopreneurship has shifted:\n\nMany of us work for ourselves, not to earn more or accomplish more from a professional perspective.\n\nRather, we work for ourselves for the freedom it provides.\n\nFreedom to pursue our passions.\n\nFreedom to take a long lunch break, or go on a walk, or take an afternoon nap when we feel like it.\n\nFreedom to break free for a game of basketball...Or, yes, freedom to watch the season finale of Bluey with my girls as soon as possible.\n\nTruth be told, I never planned on starting a business. It's something I just kind of stumbled upon.\n\nBut now that I have, I can't imagine ever going back to being an employee. I can't stomach the idea of asking for permission to do any of these things.\n\nNo, business ownership isn't perfect, and it isn't for everyone. But in a world that seems busier than ever, and where there is no end to what others say we SHOULD be doing, it offers freedom to do what we COULD be doing.\n\nFreedom to do what we wish we were doing.\n\nAnd of all the lessons I've learned from Bluey, that just may be the best one of all.\n\n#bluey #thesign #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 11mo ago": "Sing us a song, piano man...uh, please?\n\nImagine the following scene: You're a huge Billy Joel fan, and you've been enjoying an amazing concert on television--Joel's 100th show at New York City's famed Madison Square Garden. You're at the absolute emotional climax as Joel plays the final song of his set, his most famous: Piano Man.\n\nThen, as you're singing along, right in the middle of the song...\n\nThe screen suddenly fades to black, followed by the beginning of the nightly news.\n\nThat's apparently what happened to countless viewers across the eastern and central parts of the U.S. on Sunday night. Apparently, there was a special report after the Masters that \"wasn't accounted for by the powers that be,\" according to Evan Closky, Sports Director for CBS affiliate 10 Tampa Bay.\n\nImmediately, Billy Joel fans took to social media to blast the network. \"Evidently, CBS was no longer in the mood for a melody,\" wrote sports media news site Awful Announcing on X.\n\nThe worst part of this debacle, though, was what happened next. Instead of apologizing, or giving an alternative way to view the end of the concert, CBS did nothing. As in, their social accounts remained completely silent.\n\nWhat can businesses learn from CBS's major fail? And how can you apply those lessons to your own business? Here are two major takeaways:\n\n1. Monitor social media, especially during a launch.\n2. Don't just apologize. Fix it.\n\nRead more details about how to apply these lessons to your own business in today's column.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Did CBS completely mishandle this situation—and miss a major opportunity in the process? \n\nLook forward to reading your comments.\n\n#leadership #management #billyjoel #pianoman #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 11mo ago": "\"All I have to say is, the revenge tour is over.\"\n\nThat's what South Carolina point guard Raven Johnson said on the podium yesterday, after the South Carolina Gamecocks defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes for the Women's Basketball NCAA National Championship. The victory was especially sweet, considering Iowa and its star Caitlin Clark ousted South Carolina in last year's Final Four.\n\nBut there's a bit more to this story.\n\nYou might remember a viral moment from last year's Iowa-South Carolina game: At one point, Clark refused to guard Johnson from behind the three point arc. Clark even looked away from Johnson, making a hand gesture that in basketball culture is basically sign language for, \"I'm not worried about you making a shot from out there.\"\n\nAn embarrassing moment like that could destroy a player's confidence. But Johnson didn't allow that to happen. Instead, she used the moment as motivation.\n\n\"What happened last year was the best thing that happened to me because I got in the gym and worked on my weakness,\" Johnson said in a recent interview. \"I think it put a chip on my shoulder to just get in the gym and get better. Improve on my game, improve on who I am.\"\n\nBeyond that, though, it also inspired Johnson to double down on her ability to defend Clark.\n\nLast year, Clark torched South Carolina for 41 points. At the beginning of yesterday's game, it looked like she was on pace to better that, as she scored 18 points in the first quarter alone.\n\nThen, Johnson stepped in.\n\n\"When the game started, they started with a 20 point lead,\" Johnson said. \"I was asking coach, like, 'let me get her, let me get her.'\"\n\nJohnson said that she took what happened last year personally. That motivated her to take 200 three point shots a day in practice. It also moved her to watch film of Clark, studying her moves.\n\n\"I was ready for her,\" said Johnson.\n\nAnd ready she was. Clark clearly struggled as Johnson served as her primary defender for the rest of the game, scoring only 12 more points with an inefficient shot completion of 10 for 28. Additionally, Johnson tallied two blocks and four steals, including a clean pick of Clark's pocket that led to a layup putting the Gamecocks up by three to end the half.\n\nI've studied countless elite athletes and businesspeople over the years, and when it comes to mastering emotions and leveraging them to your advantage, one lesson keeps coming out loud and clear:\n\nEmotionally intelligent people experience negative emotions like everyone else. What sets them apart is their ability to bounce back from those emotions, and turn negative feelings into a catalyst for positive results.\n\n(Read more examples of this vital lesson in today's column.)\n\n#FinalFour #management #EmotionalIntelligence #ncaa #basketball #resilience #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 11mo ago": "Your playlist may be more valuable than you think.\n\nResearch has long indicated that music has the potential to boost concentration and performance on cognitive tasks such as writing or spatial reasoning, and that music can also be a powerful tool for emotional regulation. Now, researchers from New York University Tandon School of Engineering have begun to show how these two principles may work together.\n\n\"Maintaining a proper level of cognitive arousal [also known as 'intensity of emotion'] may result in being more productive throughout daily cognitive activities,\" writes Rose Faghih, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering, along with her associates who coauthored a new study analyzing how music choices influence productivity.\n\nFaghih and her colleagues found that listening to exciting music enabled five out of six participants to register higher performance on cognitive tasks. But the study is interesting because it was inspired by the Yerkes-Dodson Law, a little known law of psychology designed to model the relationship between stress and behavior, developed over a hundred years ago.\n\nAnd while this study is new with a small sample size, it actually builds on previous neuroscience research that analyzed the influence of background music on participants' emotions and performance.\n\nWhat is the Yerkes-Dodson Law, and how does it relate to previously published neuroscience research? And more importantly, how can all of this knowledge help you? \n\nTo answer these questions, let's dive more deeply into the research and see how you can put these learnings to work.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#productivity #management #EmotionalIntelligence #neuroscience #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

They had just defeated the LSU Tigers—the team who denied them of last year’s championship. And once again, Clark completed another historic performance, scoring 41 points and logging 12 assists in 40 minutes played.\n\nA short time later, Clark would face the media for a postgame interview. A reporter asked her if revenge was on her mind as her team faced LSU for the second year in a row.\n\n“To be honest, no,” replied Clark. “It’s not about last year. You worry too much about the past, you’re going to get caught up in that. It’s about being present. Being where your feet are. Don’t worry about being in the Final Four. Be in this moment…That’s what’s going to allow you to win 40 minutes, and that’s exactly what we did.”\n\nThere’s a great lesson here for anyone interested in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions in order to reach a goal. And Clark summed it up in just four words:\n\nBe in this moment.\n\nWhy is this simple, four-word phrase so significant?

He played hard. He got his teammates involved. And although he struggled shooting the ball for much of the evening, he hit two key shots down the stretch that essentially sealed the win for the Warriors.\n\nAll of this was possible because of one thing: \n\nCurry refused to dwell on negative emotions. Instead, he used them as a catalyst.\n\nWhy is dwelling on negative emotions so harmful? And how can you avoid doing so, and instead make negative emotions work to your advantage? \n\nLet’s answer those questions and see how you can apply these lessons in your own life. \n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #goldenstate #warriors #stephcurry #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Doughnuts. \n\n...at McDonald's?\n\nThe two chains announced yesterday that the two iconic brands would be expanding their partnership, with Krispy Kreme doughnuts available in participating McDonald’s restaurants nationwide by 2026.\n\nBoth McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme used the same press release to make their announcement, leading with this first line: \n\nKrispy Kreme to provide fresh doughnuts daily at McDonald’s restaurants nationwide.\n\nLet's focus on just three words:\n\nFresh doughnuts daily.\n\nThe reason why these words are remarkable has to do with Krispy Kreme’s history.\n\nIn 2006, Krispy Kreme was dying. The company was cash flow negative, while facing billions of dollars in lawsuits with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Employee turnover was over 20 percent. It was under investigation by the Department of Justice due to shady accounting practices, and worst of all, same-store sales were declining dramatically.\n\nDuring this time you might have noticed that Krispy Kreme doughnuts were ubiquitous: You could find them in several different types of grocery stores, even in gas stations.\n\nBut these doughnuts were sold wholesale. In terms of quality, freshness, and taste, those packaged products were much different from the doughnuts you'd get when buying directly at a Krispy Kreme store.\n\nOver the next years, though, the company would embark on a major turnaround, starting with its distribution model. Let's see what you can learn from the change, along with the company's new partnership. \n\n#krispykreme #mcdonald's #sales #distribution #howtosell",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "Over the past few years, I’ve received thousands of emails from readers who want to improve their emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions. \n\nOf all the skills people want to develop, the following pops up over and over again:\n\nHow do I manage my emotions and reduce anxiety?\n\nDeveloping emotional intelligence is a lifelong journey. But after studying and teaching these skills for several years, I’ve found that the right frameworks, habits, and systems—along with intentional practice—can help you make significant progress when it comes to managing your emotions and all the benefits that come along with that skill.\n\nHere are five things I do to help me keep my emotions under control. \n\n1. Control your thoughts\n\nLearn how to control your thoughts, and you'll learn how to manage emotions. That's why I've found the following frameworks are invaluable. \n\n2. Use the rule of reframing\n\nThe Rule of Reframing involves reconceptualizing a problem by changing the way I look at it. \n\nFor example, as someone who enjoys working under rules and structure, I get thrown off when I start my workday late. (I work for myself.) But that’s often necessary because my wife and I split the household and childcare duties.\n\nSo, I have to change my perspective from “I'm getting such a late start; I hate this” to “It's great that I'm so flexible; We need this!”\n\n3. Use the golden question\n\nWhen I need to make a decision under emotional circumstances, I ask myself:\n\nHow will I feel about this in:\n\n-A day\n-A week\n-A month\n-A year\n-Five years\n\nThe golden question gives me a glimpse into the future, so I make better decisions in the present.\n\n4. Remind yourself that \"they don't know\"\n\nIf someone makes an ignorant or judgmental comment directed at me, the phrase “they don’t know” reminds me that:\n\n“They don't know what I know. They don't know what my life is like. They don't know all the other stuff that goes with this.”\n\nThis framework simply helps me recognize there’s no way the person could understand my situation. \n\nIt changes your feelings from: “I can't believe they said that\" to \"Oh, yeah. They don't know. All good.\"\n\n5. Use an emotional postmortem\n\nI still make mistakes, sometimes even big ones. When that happens, I buy out time to reflect and identify what led to the mistake so I can reduce the times it happens in the future.\n\nTo help me do that, I use an “emotional postmortem.” It’s a simple process that allows me to clear my mind, identify root causes, and make needed adjustments.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#management #mentalhealth #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou #leadership",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "\"You really have to stand up for yourself.\"\n\nThat's the message Shark Tank Star Barbara Corcoran sent loud and clear in a recent interview she gave LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky. The interview is full of powerful lessons from Corcoran's life, but one story stood head and shoulders above the rest:\n\nThe time Shark Tank \"fired\" her, before she filmed a single episode.\n\nCorcoran said she received a call from a woman asking her to be on a new show called \"Shark Tank.\" Ecstatic, Corcoran agreed. She immediately went on a shopping spree, buying new outfits and autograph signing materials. \"I'm going to Hollywood!\" she excitedly told her friends.\n\nThen, Corcoran got a dreadful phone call telling her \"they changed their mind,\" and they had decided to give her seat to another woman.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe it,\" said Corcoran. \"It was the equivalent of [my ex-husband] telling me he was marrying my secretary.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Corcoran says she was \"crestfallen.\" But after taking a minute to feel sorry for herself, she took matters into her own hands.\n\nCorcoran wrote an email directly to Shark Tank creator, Mark Burnett.\n\n\"Dear Mark, I consider your rejection a lucky charm,\" Corcoran says. \"Everything good happens to me after I get rejected.\"\n\nCorcoran then detailed multiple stories as evidence, including the time Donald Trump told her she'd never collect a penny of her $4 million commission, after which Corcoran says she sued Trump and got every penny.\n\nCorcoran ended the email like this:\n\n\"I expect to be on that plane on Tuesday. And I hope you let me compete for the seat.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Burnett's secretary wrote Corcoran telling her she would have her chance to compete for the seat.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nCorcoran's actions teach a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Let's break down three valuable takeaways from Corcoran's story, and see how you can apply them to your own work life. \n\n#SharkTank #BarbaraCorcoran #emotionalintelligence #management #personalgrowth #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

I stood there for a few seconds, just processing it. \n \n'Is that true?' I remember thinking. 'Who else feels that way?'\n \nThat moment led to various occasions of self-reflection over the years. \n\nAll of us have to lead at some point. Some are thrust into positions of authority whether they like it or not, like the couple who suddenly discover they will become parents. \n \nMaybe you become a leader at work because you were good at your job, but you never really got any leadership training.\n \nSo how do you lead effectively? \n\nYou can start with the following:\n \n1. Set the example.\nLet's say you ask me how to get somewhere you've never been before. I could outline step by step directions, draw you a map, even provide details about landmarks to look out for.\n \nOr I could say: \"That's not too far out of my way. Why don't you just follow me?\"\n \nGuess which method works better.\n\nWhen you work hard to show others what you believe in, they'll naturally follow.\n \n2. Practice humility.\nBoss #1: Makes a mistake. When it's exposed, he/she refuses to admit it or tries to blame someone else.\n \nBoss #2: Realizes he/she isn't perfect. After recognizing a mistake, they readily admit and learn from it.\n \nWho would you prefer to work for?\n \n\"Leaders\" are no more perfect than followers. Owning up to that inspires respect.\n \n3. Praise sincerely and specifically.\nPraise and recognition can be motivating and inspiring—if they're authentic and specific.\n \nHow to start: Pick one or two employees a day and tell them something specific you've valued about their work (e.g., the way they handled a project or problem or a specific quality you saw in action). Tell them how and why you found their actions so beneficial. The more details, the better.\n \nOf course, you have to give critical feedback, too. But praise and appreciation is how your people know you care. And once they feel cared for, they'll be more open to hear how they can improve.\n \nWe're all faced with opportunities to lead, so focus on leading effectively.\n \nThose who follow will do so, not because they have to, but because they want to.\n\n***\n\nWant to learn more about how to be an emotionally intelligent leader?

As he attempted to begin his press conference, Kelce started to break down in tears. He took about a minute to gather himself before proceeding.\n\nOver the next 40 minutes, he waxed poetic: about the game of football, about the joy of winning, and the agony of defeat. He praised his family, his teammates, his coaches, his trainers, the cafeteria workers--and the city of Philadelphia. He shared memories, some good, some bad, but all deeply moving.\n\nThrough it all, Kelce alternated between reading and weeping.\n\nIn doing so, he taught a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, namely:\n\nCrying is good for you.\n\nWhat are the benefits of crying? Why does crying help you in emotional moments? And how can you use this knowledge to your advantage? \n\nCheck out today's column—along with a personal story of why I can relate to Kelce.\n\n#eagles #leadership #emotionalintelligence #management #personalgrowth #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "Recently I was speaking with a fellow business owner about a paid membership community I joined, raving about how helpful it's been for me personally. \n\nI told him how the community was capped at 200 and how I thought that was the sweet spot for giving and adding value, and how I thought it might be a really good fit for him, too.\n\nTo be clear, I had zero angle in sharing this info; I had no business interest in the community (other than being a paying member).\n\nBut afterwards, I couldn't help but think to myself:\n\nI wonder if he thought I was being too pushy?\n\nA few days later, he texted me.\n\n\"Ah looks like [the community's] maxed out already at 200. But thanks!\"\n\nI started to text him back. \"Oh, no worries,\" I typed. \"New spots open up every month! I can put in a good word for you; I'm sure I can get you in.\"\n\nBut then, I thought about it:\n\nWhat good would this do? \n\nHad my friend shown any real interest in joining the community? \n\nHow might he feel if I kept pushing? How might it affect our relationship?\n\nIn the end, I didn't type any reply at all. I simply thumbed up his message, forgot about it, and moved on.\n\nThe reason has to do with a simple, three-word phrase that's become part of my emotionally intelligent toolbox:\n\nPerception is reality.\n\nHow can \"perception is reality\" enable you to develop and show empathy? How can it help you to know when to stop, and even strengthen your relationships? \n\nFind out the answers in today's column.\n\n#management #personalgrowth #emotionalintelligence #perceptionisreality #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Most presented the phrase \"dynamic pricing\" as indicating that Wendy’s would test raising prices during high-traffic hours, similar to how ridesharing companies like Uber use “surge pricing” during times of high demand.\n\nAs reports circulated, backlash ensued. \n\nSoon after, though, Wendy’s claimed the whole thing was a big misunderstanding. \n\nIn a statement on the company’s official blog, Wendy’s said the update about digital menuboards was “misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest at our restaurants.”\n\n“We have no plans to do that and would not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most,” the statement continues. \n\nYikes.\n\nThis brings up some very big problems that have much to do with emotional intelligence—and more specifically, with the power of language and the emotional effect of the words you choose. \n\nWhat can you learn from this fiasco?

The letter begins with a tribute to Munger, who served as Vice Chairman at Berkshire Hathaway for decades before passing away a few months ago.\n\nBut while the media often portrayed Munger as playing second fiddle, and Munger himself often deferred to Buffett publicly, Buffett used his letter to set the record straight.\n\n“Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades,” writes Buffett. \n\n“In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten,” Buffett continued. “Berkshire has become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.”\n\nCharlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\n\nWith those nine words, Buffett not only honors his friend and business partner, he teaches a powerful lesson in emotionally intelligent leadership—both on his part, and the part of Munger. \n\nIn today's column, take a closer look at the lessons revealed by Buffett’s tribute, and see how you can apply them to your own business. \n\n#management #berkshirehathaway #warrenbuffett #charliemunger #leadership #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Everyone told Watson how great she was, that she was knocking at the door of the most senior level of the company.\n\nYet, years went by. Plenty of promises and no action.\n\n\"When I would ask what's going on,\" says Maya, \"I was met with some version of this...\"\n\n\"With everything going on, It's just not the right time.\"\n\"We're working on a plan for you, sit tight.\"\n\"We need to see more from you.\"\n\n\"I became increasingly frustrated,\" Maya says. \"I started to believe that maybe it was me. Maybe I wasn't ready.\"\n\nThen, one day, Maya ran into one of her mentors, a well-respected VP at the company. Seeing that Maya looked frustrated, he asked if she was ok.\n\n\"No, I'm not ok,\" Maya replied. \"What more do I need to show? How much longer do I have to wait?\"\n\nMaya's mentor chuckled. Looking her dead in the eye, he said:\n\n\"I have more than 200 people in my organization. It's not statistically possible for me to think about their development or roadmap for their life and career. You have to take matters into your own hands or you'll be waiting forever. No one is coming to save you.\"\n\nMaya stood there speechless.\n\n\"He was absolutely right and I couldn't believe I never saw it that way until that moment,\" says Maya. \"I have always believed that frustration comes from a gap between expectations and reality. It set me free.\"\n\nThat conversation set Maya on a new path. Within a couple of years, she left Netflix. And less than two years after that, she had cofounded her own company and was working--and living--on her own terms.\n\nAll of this because Maya was able to finally see reality. She was able to \"remove the illusion.\"\n\nThis story reminded me of a conversation I recently had with a friend. As an American living in Germany, I talk a lot about language and words, and this friend shared a brilliant German word with a fascinating meaning.\n\nThe word is Enttäuschung (pronounced ent-TOY-shung).\n\nEnttäuschung is officially translated \"disappointment,\" but there's a deeper meaning when you look at the literal breakdown of the word. Doing so teaches a major lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, as it can help you transform disappointment into something motivating and empowering.\n\nWhat does the German word Enttäuschung have to do with Watson's story?

That extra zero led to a huge jump in share price in after-hours trading, briefly creating about $2 billion in market cap for Lyft. \n\nAnalysts said they had never seen a mistake like this in the history of financial reporting. \n\n“We go through hours and hours of checking and double checking before something like this goes [public],” Risher explained. “It’s an unacceptable error. Again, ultimately it’s on me—I’m the CEO, the buck stops with me.”\n\nRisher’s humble reply is a great example of emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to build trust, motivate, and inspire.

Last night he won his third Super Bowl MVP award, which ties him with Hall of Famer Joe Montana and places him second (along with Montana) behind Tom Brady, who has five Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nIn his postgame interview, though, Mahomes credited Kansas City Head Coach Andy Reid for enabling him to achieve this level of success. Calling Reid the “best coach of all time,” Mahomes explained exactly how his mentor has helped him through the years.\n\n“For me, he brings out the best in me because he lets me be me,” Mahomes said. “He doesn’t try to make me anyone else. I don’t think I’d be the quarterback that I am if I didn’t have coach Reid being my head coach.”\n\nHe brings out the best in me.\n\nIn just seven words, Mahomes identifies a hallmark trait of all great coaches and leaders, teaching a brilliant lesson in the process: \n\nGreat leaders bring out the best in their people.\n\nAs a business owner or leader, how can you bring out the best in your people?

Rubio further described his mental health struggles, saying on that fateful night his “mind went to a dark place,” a moment that led to his decision to stop his professional career.\n\nOne day, said Rubio, he’d like to share his full experience to support others facing mental health struggles. Until then, though, he asked for privacy out of respect for himself and his family. \n\n“But I’m proud to say I’m doing much better and getting better every day,” he added.\n\nRubio went on to thank the four teams he played for in his NBA career, which led to “lots of good memories and great relationships.” But what he said next was truly remarkable.\n\n“Special mention to Cleveland,” wrote Rubio. “My last home. I know the way things ended have been tough. I could never have imagined the year would develop this way, but you have been an amazing organization, with [president of basketball operations] Koby [Altman] and [head coach] J.B. [Bickerstaff], who have been extremely respectful and understanding of my situation and caring for me as a person.”\n\nWow. Now that’s a statement you don’t hear every day when describing how a company deals with a struggling employee.\n\nI found these ten words especially encouraging:\n\n\"Extremely respectful and understanding\"\n\n\"Caring for me as a person\"\n\nNowadays, a lot of companies know how to “talk the talk” when it comes to supporting employee mental health, but few know how to “walk the walk.”\n\nThat’s what makes Rubio’s statement so notable. Although Rubio only spent two years in Cleveland, his words of praise demonstrate the role a company can play in helping a person manage their struggles with mental health.\n\nIf you’re a business owner or leader, how can you support your people during difficult times? Here are two key actions you can put into practice. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#management #mentalhealth #emotionalintelligence #RickyRubio #cleveland #cavaliers #leadership #personalgrowth #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "\"It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair. We're getting stronger now...These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down. This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win.\"\n\nIf you're a bona fide Swiftie, you'll recognize those lines from Taylor Swift's song Change. But nowadays, that inspirational prose may symbolize something more for Swift herself: They aptly describe Swift's experience over the past few years--and how the pop superstar transformed a major difficulty into a massive opportunity.\n\nIt all began in 2019, when record executive Scooter Braun's purchase of Swift's former label, Big Machine Records, resulted in his gaining control over several of Swift's master recordings. Swift, who has oft spoke about the bullying she endured from Braun and his client Kanye West, described the event as being \"stripped of my life's work.\"\n\nBut instead of sulking or sinking into despair, Swift took matters into her own hands: She began re-recording her old albums, giving her ownership of a new set of master recordings. \n\nIn essence, Swift enacted a plan to gain full control of all her music, and even released new songs from \"the vault,\" original songs that Swift had originally composed for those albums, but that were cut by the powers that be at her previous label.\n\nIn doing so, Swift applied a major principle of emotional intelligence: She used the difficulty. In other words, rather than fall victim to a challenging situation, Swift leveraged her circumstances to produce a positive result, something great that may not have existed in an easier situation.\n\nIn the end, Swift sold millions of new units in re-recorded albums, including a record-breaking release of 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023, which turned out to be Swift's bestselling album debut of all time.\n\nSwift's master class in emotional intelligence was one of this column's most popular stories in 2023. You'll find a few more in today's column.\n\n#management #taylorswift #emotionalintelligence #leadership #personalgrowth #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eyxNxuBm",

Suddenly, the meeting chair hands you and everyone else a six-page memo.\n\nAnd then...You sit. In silence.\n\nFor 30 minutes.\n\n\"Meetings at Amazon...are unusual,\" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in a recent interview with Lex Fridman. \"For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together in the meeting and read, take notes in the margins. And then we discuss.\"\n\nThis isn't something new at Amazon; Bezos has been preaching the value of a \"silent start\" to meetings for several years. In fact, it was way back in 2004 when Bezos reportedly banned PowerPoint in executive meetings, replacing it with \"well-structured, narrative text.\"\n\nBut why did Bezos advocate for this change? How does starting meetings with a study hall lead to better thinking and decision making? Let's take a closer look at those questions, and see how the answers can help you consider whether or not to use a silent start in your meetings. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#amazon #management #leadership #emotionalintelligence #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e_8giJ2N",

Many have blamed the mass exodus on the actions of X's owner, Elon Musk, along with companies' unwillingness to be associated with the X brand.\n\nBut in a recent interview with CNN, Shark Tank Investor and serial entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary says he left X for a completely different reason.\n\n\"I spend about two million [dollars] a month on social/digital buys with my 40 plus companies,\" O'Leary explained. \"But nine weeks ago, we stopped investing in Twitter. Only because it wasn't giving us good CAC, Customer Acquisition Cost numbers, and ROAS, Return on Advertising Spend. So those numbers were the worst of all the platforms.\"\n\n\"I would put money to work if they could fix this mess,\" continued O'Leary. \"I don't know what to say. It's not working.\"\n\nIt's not working.\n\nWith those three words, O'Leary sums up why he left advertising on X, and it has nothing to do with Musk or the controversial issues he's been dealing with. In fact, O'Leary said he's \"agnostic\" to the controversial issues, and that his goal is simply to \"put money to work where it returns customers.\" He also said he has \"high hopes for Elon to fix it.\"\n\nThere's a deeper lesson to extract here, one that could be valuable not only to X, but also to you and your business. And it has to do, not with X's advertisers, but with its customers.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\ntwitter #x #kevinoleary #elonmusk #management #emotionalintelligence #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Yesterday, Hurts led the Eagles to yet another come from behind victory, this time against the Buffalo Bills. In doing so, he set a new NFL record: most consecutive victories by a quarterback after trailing by ten or more points.\n\nOther than Hurts, no quarterback has done that more than four times.\nHurts has done it eight times.\n\nSo, how does he do it? How does Hurts manage to stay calm under pressure?\n\nIn last night's postgame press conference, Hurts shed some light on his thinking process. Asked how he's able to meet special moments with such effectiveness, Hurts said the following:\n\n\"I think in those moments, you just truly don't want to get too high, never get too low,\" said Hurts. \"And we found a way in the end. We made it happen.\"\n\nDon't get too high, and never get too low.\n\nAt first glance, those nine words may seem like just another platitude.

You spend time searching for the right fit, you get to know each other, you discuss what’s important to you, you compromise until you find the thing that works best for both of you, and ultimately you hope you’ll be happy and fulfilled in your choice. \n\nBut after a time - and it might be immediately, it might be months or even years - you start to notice things that don’t quite fit. Time reveals all things, so maybe you start to feel antsy, unappreciated, and undervalued. You begin to reassess: Is this what I want? Is this making me happy? Does it matter if I’m happy? \n\nBut just like a relationship, there are so many factors that determine whether the right move is to stick it out in your current job or move on. Maybe there’s enough good to outweigh the discomfort. \n\nMaybe the discomfort is irrelevant to your long-term goals. \n\nMaybe the discomfort is a good challenge. \n\nHow do you decide?",

If this adjustment back into the office after the pandemic has you feeling frustrated, you are not alone.\n\nAdjusting to any different work environment can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to steal joy from your job. While working remotely has its perks, working in the office does too.\n\nThree reasons why office work is advantageous to work are simple connection, easy collaboration, and stronger culture. Ask yourself to name five reasons why working in an office might work to your advantage. Write these reasons down in a place you can see them often. When we keep the positive reasons at the forefront, it’s harder to let office work get us into a rut.\n\nSpeaking of good reasons to work in the office, Pete High, President of Metis Strategy, a business and IT advisory firm, wrote a brilliant article on his five reasons to work in the office.

Here's my response to a disappointing performance review and promised promotion: \n\nLet's make the assumption that you received a glowing performance review because you delivered value, demonstrated your worth, and exceeded goals and expectations for your role. Even after an A+ performance review, there might be other circumstances outside of your supervisor’s control prohibiting that promotion you were promised when you started, but you absolutely deserve to know the reasoning behind it.\n\nI would recommend scheduling a follow up meeting with your supervisor to discuss your performance review in more detail. Come prepared with your questions and supporting evidence on why you deserve the promotion (outside of it being communicated to you when you started). There is always room to negotiate, especially with a stellar performance review, but if the company can’t promote you now due to financial reason, think outside the box. Request additional paid time off, flexible work time, or a transportation allowance. \n\nLastly, work with your supervisor to create a plan that will pave the path to promotion. Take the initiative to come up with goals to push the business forward and ask for feedback along the way.",

Here are my thoughts around the question: Is it better to work for a company in a large city for a couple of years with competitive pay and, if I don’t like it, move back to a smaller city? Or would just starting out where you want to live and stay there be better?\n\nThere really is no right or wrong answer to your question, but there are additional things you should consider before location and compensation when applying for jobs.\n\nThe most critical part of entering the workforce post college is gaining relevant experience.  I would recommend focusing on the jobs that will pave the path to your ideal career long term, and what potential companies you would like to work for first. Location does play an important role is personal happiness, so focus on that next. Would you thrive in a big urban city? Would you be bored in a small city? Does the city have things that are important to you (ie: weather, bike trails, sports, theater, etc.)?\n\nSo as you gear up to start your search, I encourage you to thoroughly examine the actual job opportunity, company, and personal happiness when applying for jobs.",

Luckily, right before she left, she got a small, mostly chihuahua long-haired black puppy named Layla. \n\nFortunately for me, right after she got Layla, my daughter moved somewhere that didn’t allow dogs – leaving Layla and I to figure out what came next. Left to make her way in a family she didn’t expect to be part of, Layla took the prison approach and befriended the biggest, most tattooed guy in the joint. \n\nThat was me. \n\nAnd it worked. \n\nOver the past two years, Layla has completely wrapped me around her finger. I have lost all perspective about this dog. I believe she has magical healing abilities. I believe she can understand and contextualize almost everything I say. I even believe the phase where she ate her own poop resulted from a too-powerful brain just getting its signals crossed, due mostly to Layla being on a whole other level. \n\nI have said, out loud, on multiple occasions, with my wife and children in the room, that if all the madness in the world leads to a zombie apocalypse, I am stuffing Layla in a backpack and keeping her safe. \n\nBefore I even try to save anyone else. \n\nI usually say this when she's sitting on my lap, and when I do, Layla always stands up and licks my chin. \n\nDespite my wife’s obvious annoyance when I guarantee Layla’s safety, I promise you that if I told her I was stuffing her in a backpack, she wouldn’t lick my chin. \n\nSo, yeah. \n\nIf you're working remotely, and you don't already have one, get yourself a Layla. \n\nYou’re going to need one. \n\n#dogsoflinkedin #fridayinspiration",

    "Jack McKissen's post 1yr ago": "Tips on How to be a LinkedIn Top Voice 🏆 ! \n\nI am beyond thrilled to share that the LinkedIn editorial team selected me as a “LinkedIn Top Voice” for 2024! 🚀 \n\nOn my profile you’ll notice the little blue icon beneath my name, which means I have joined the likes of Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Barack Obama. It’s a pretty prestigious group! 🎉 \n\nLike I’ve been telling Megan McKissen for 20 years, it’s also the logical list for me to belong on 🤣 \n\nSeriously though, I really can’t capture how much this means to me. I was part of the first two classes of Top Voices in 2015 and 2016 – but a lot has changed for me since then, and a lot has changed for the world. Honestly, 2015 seems like a lifetime ago and an entire world away. \n\nHaving been a creator on here for 10 years, I get asked a lot about how I’ve built this platform. I wrote the article below when I was privileged enough to be on the LinkedIn team, but here are a few additional tips for growing your presence on LinkedIn:\n\n- Other social media platforms revolve around sharing your opinions. LinkedIn, in one form or another, is often about sharing your hopes, aspirations, and dreams. That means that you can help someone achieve some of those hopes and dreams by becoming part of their community. When you do that, you achieve true influence.\n\n- Be an original. There are thought leaders, and there are parrots. I don’t know if it’s because beaks and talons aren’t compatible with keyboards, but parrots have limited impact on LinkedIn – and in life. There is no thought leadership in being the millionth person to say AI (or the trend of the moment) is going to change the world. \n\n- Be willing to say something controversial. Like the way I just p*ssed off parrot owners and AI evangelists while announcing my Top Voice designation. But don’t say something controversial just for the sake of it, and keep your partisan politics away from this platform. \n\n- More than anything, be kind. If you’re a good person, and you let that light shine, and you are willing to be courageous and say what you think – even (and especially) when you know a handful of people are going to call you an idiot (or worse) – then you won’t have to worry about building a personal brand or becoming a “thought leader.” You’re already there.\n\nSo, thank you to Katie Carroll, the LinkedIn editorial team, Paul Petrone, Sean Callahan, and a long list of additional current and former colleagues for their support. And more than anything, a heartfelt thank you to the people who have read my work and engaged with me on this platform over the last decade!\n\nLike my hero (and the best content creator ever) Bruce Springsteen often says before an encore, “Thank you, thank you, thank you. You’ve been a wonderful audience.” 🎸 \n\nAnd I genuinely hope every one of you has a had a great start to what will be an amazing 2024!",

So, I changed my first name to Jack (my wife’s favorite name for a man) and my middle name to Colizanger (a name made from the combination of my kids’ names). \n\nI went from being named after the family I was born to to being named after the family I made. It’s awesome, but it a lot of work—and can be as traumatic as it sounds. \n\nFor the most part, I focused on moving forward rather than trying to change the past. \n\nHowever, I was the first person in my family to graduate from a four-year college. It was my first achievement that had nothing to do—good or bad—with my dad. \n\nSo, even though I earned my degree on July 4, 2005, having my degrees in my new name is it’s own form of independence. The first one arrived in the mail yesterday, and I love looking at it. \n\nLife can be weird, and hard, and people face all sorts of struggles you’ll never understand—but you can always choose who YOU want to be.\n\nEven if it’s literally a brand new you.",

The other kind.\n\nThe hater kind. 🤯\n\nHere’s the \"inflammatory\" thing I said on Instagram this week: “It’s so easy to live a B+ life, but an A+ is available to us – if we do the work.” \n\nI love this opinion of mine! It took me my whole life to get to it. Because I, like 99.999% of all human beings, let other people edit my life for years and years and years. Why? Because I loved them.\n\nBut over time, I came to know and embrace my true values, and I became the author of my life. None of the “editors” seemed to mind, by the way. The truth is, the people who love us usually want us to be authentic, once they get used to the idea. (Translation: “Eventually, my darling kids and beloved husband got over me working full-time.” 💗)\n\nMy journey to myself is hardly uncommon. Indeed, that’s why Becoming You exists, to help people on the road to full authenticity, where we live our values to our heart’s delight. Doing so is not a selfish thing, by the way, it is a flourishing thing.\n\nYou would think this would be uncontroversial, right, supporting authenticity? We certainly did, when we posted the offending video. But no. Apparently, urging people to not settle for OK, but keep trying for great is dangerous, entitled, and out of touch. Who knew?\n\nLook, people are entitled to their views, just as I am. More than anything, really, I don’t hate their comments, I hate how much some people want to hate. It’s entertainment to them. It’s sport.\n\nIck. \n\nThe mission statement of Becoming Universe, which is what we call our little company amongst ourselves, is “To support, assist, and throw love on every single messy messball of the world as we all do the hard work of answering what it is we plan to do with our one wild and precious life.”\n\nMy favorite part of that blurb is the phrase “throw love.” We are in the love business over here. My second favorite part is “messy messball,” a term I invented to describe humanity, myself thoroughly included.\n\nWhat I hate is that we are not all in the love business.",

To be honest, I probably imagined it would be some kind of power trip where I’d get to sit back, audition eager candidates, and pick the best one. \n\nNowadays, I do a lot of hiring as the CEO of the company that makes Becoming You possible. I also teach hiring as part of my NYU Stern School of Business management class, where I repeatedly tell my MBAs that the only easy thing about hiring is getting it wrong. \n\nLately, I have been especially down on hiring because I am trying to find a copywriter. After investing hours and hours sorting through resumes and interviewing, and not a small amount of money on advertising, two great finalists dropped out saying the job entailed “too much work,” and a third great finalist stayed around until she didn’t. Yep, I got ghosted. Sadly, this is a familiar pattern.\n\nNow, there is one bright spot, in that we have just brought on board a spectacular CRM lead, who was perfect throughout the hiring journey from start to finish. But she’s a rare bird – which is why we are so happy she’s now part of our flock.\n\nI have no great wisdom here except to acknowledge that business is hard. It’s worth it, yes. But it’s hard in every way. \n\nWhat are your tips for hiring, or getting through business when the going gets tough? Comment your thoughts below. 👇",

Others not so much, to put it mildly. Such an approach to life, they seemed to concur, is a fast track to burnout. \n\nMaybe so, but not in my experience. In fact, every time I’ve pushed myself to be better at something, or urged my team to reach for the next level, it’s led to excitement. And hope.🤸\n\nYesterday, I wrapped up teaching “Becoming You: Crafting The Authentic Life You Want and Need” for the semester. You can see from the pic below that it ended on a high note. 👏 \n\nI should have felt great – and I did.\n\nBut this morning, I woke up and scribbled two full pages of notes about what I need to do better next semester. That’s me in my robe at 7am getting all my ideas for improvements logged into my notebook. \n\nNo, I don’t think there was anything “mediocre” about my class this semester. I wouldn’t have taught it if I thought so. But I also think that we can – and should – always keep striving to elevate, expand, and deepen what we share with the world.\n\nIt kind of annoys me to feel any other way. 😉",

It was a great story, my producer said, because for every pair of false eyelashes this entrepreneur sold, she donated a pair to a woman who had lost her own eyelashes during chemotherapy.\n\n“How sweet,” I thought, and off I went.\n\nAnd thus began my friendship with Karissa Bodnar, the founder and CEO of Thrive Causemetics Inc. – a company that has become so successful that last year it gave $150 million to charity. \n\nThrive is so well run as a business and Karissa is such a freaking great CEO that last year I invited her to do a star turn in my management class at NYU Stern School of Business. My students were awestruck by her wisdom about leadership. By the way, she is now 34.\n\nIn my Becoming You class – and in my podcast, newsletter, and workshops – I am always urging people to do the hard work to discover their values, their aptitudes, and economically viable interests so that they can find and live their purpose. Because your purpose makes you feel exquisitely alive, and usually, when you feel that way, you turn around and spread the joy.\n\nKarissa is case in point. When I met her in Seattle in 2015, she was making lipstick in her kitchen. She knew her purpose even then, to build a company that was as philanthropic as it was profitable, and in doing so, make the world a better place. \n\nShe’s done that, but at Thrive’s 10th anniversary party that I attended this week, she said she’d only just begun. \n\nI love that good news – and Karissa – too.

    "Suzy Welch's post 3w ago": "A few weeks ago, my podcast was devoted to a listener – a working mother of two teens – who wanted advice about whether she should abandon her successful career as a museum administrator. Her presenting symptom, if you will, was that she was profoundly exhausted. The career-kids balancing act was just getting too hard.\n\nAs I listened to her all-too-familiar lament, at one point I observed that the problem with trying to do kids and work at the same time comes down to biology. There are, I noted, about fifteen years of your life when your children need your undivided attention and complete availability, and the same goes for work, that is, if you’d like to get taken seriously and get promoted. \n\nSadly, due to the nature of baby-making and the conventional professional trajectory baked into the economic system, those 15 years overlap. That is, child-rearing and career-planning tend to occur roughly between the ages of 27 and 42. \n\nIn that period, everybody wants all of you, bosses and kids alike, and that’s not even mentioning your partner, friends, siblings, and parents.\n\nIt’s just a terrible, inescapable trick of timing. And here’s the thing, until AI figures out a way to replumb the human body, that trick will not change.  \n\nSo, like never.\n\nI wish it weren’t so. But it is. I love AI, and, like many, I think it is capable of doing almost everything. Coding whole websites. Analyzing massive documents. Forging marketing plans out of the ether. \n\nBut making working parenthood easier? To that, I just say, “Hmm.” How about you? More on this in today's newsletter. ⬇️",

Your sense of possibility about the future?\n\nI’m sitting here hoping ardently that you’re thinking, “All good, Suzy, all good.”\n\nBut!\n\nBut if you’re not saying “All good,” and instead something closer to, “Well, um,” then I have something to share.\n\nI’m beyond excited to announce that my NYU Stern School of Business class, “Becoming You: Crafting the Life You Want and Need,” is once again being offered as a three-day intensive on campus, open to all, from recent college grads trying to figure out their first job to retirees wondering what to do with their next chapter. The dates are March 21-23, 2025.\n\nEvery time we hold this Intensive, I am floored (in a good way!) by how just three days can change someone’s life. But please don’t take it from me; here are a few comments from previous participants:\n\n“I have that fire back… I only wish that I had been able to do it earlier.” \n\n“For the first time, I felt truly seen and validated and I was finally able to acknowledge: Yep, this is my calling! I know what to do with my life.” \n\n“Whether you are starting out in your studies or career, or want a change in direction later in life, this course is for you. The class was interactive, the material was so powerful, and learning how to talk about values was incredibly impactful.”\n\nOn the first day we will work together to excavate your unique core values, deploying multiple self-discovery exercises – which I happen to love because they’re fun, but also, and mainly, because they’re remarkably effective. We will then move on to day two, where we will assess and pinpoint your underlying aptitudes with a series of scientifically validated tests. And on the final day, we will explore which kinds of jobs, industries, and/or megatrends are the best match for you, before synthesizing the process to craft your own “Area of Transcendence,” that is, the purpose that lies at the intersection of your values, aptitudes, and interests.\n\nSpace for the Becoming You Three-Day Intensive is limited, and please know that a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund the NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, an academic center committed to advancing the study of self-discovery and meaningful careers.\n\nFor more detailed information, including an FAQ, click here: https://lnkd.in/ePxS7EwT I hope to see you there!",

    "Suzy Welch's post 1mo ago": "At age 14, I pulled my sister into our kitchen pantry the day before Christmas. She was just home from medical school on break, and I had been waiting for her. “Is it possible for someone my age to have a heart attack?” I whispered urgently.\n\n“For God’s sake, Suzy, you just have heartburn!” she assured me, laughing. “Lay off the candy canes!”\n\nShe wasn’t wrong about the candy canes, but she wasn’t right about me having heartburn. \n\nI had anxiety. \n\nI didn’t know that, though, until I had my own kids. One day, on the way to first grade, speaking softly from the back seat, one of my sons said, “Mommy, my chest is burning. It always burns in the morning.” We were soon at the doctor, who put a name to his ailment.\n\nBy that time in my life, and indeed, by the time I was away at the boarding school shown in the photo below, I had assembled a toolkit of strategies for managing my “heartburn” – running, journaling, and praying. To that list, I soon added an origami class with my son, and together we began a journey together to create his own set of coping skills.\n\nI rarely think about my own anxiety anymore, but I think all the time about the anxiety of the students I teach, because I must. Especially in my NYU Stern School of Business class Becoming You, where we talk about discovering your purpose and then designing your life to seize it.\n\nTime and again, my students ask, “Is it even possible to plan your career when you have anxiety? Just living feels hard enough.”\n\nMy answer – and you may disagree – is that planning is an antidote to anxiety, not an anathema. \n\nLook, careers can cause stress whether you have anxiety or not. You can run from that stress, or avoid it, and just let life happen to you. \n\nOr you can step into your fear by amassing detailed data about yourself and the world of work. And then using that data to build a roadmap.\n\nI understand the first approach. Indeed, I literally feel for people who choose it.\n\nBut if you can, even if it feels very hard at first, I urge you to try the second. Your anxiety will fight you, but it’s the fight of your life to fight back. \n\nI am working on a podcast right now to talk more about anxiety and career planning. If you have any thoughts – or better yet, advice – please share them in the comments below. \n\nAnd by the way, I never did lay off the candy canes.",

How current you are, in terms of events, people, and trends, drives the level of your currency, i.e. your value, to your organization and/or your customers.\n\nWhich is why every year my team watches me weep softly into my hands when my invitation to the highly coveted JP Morgan Miami conference arrives. Why? Because this conference makes me so much smarter. \n\nSo. Much. Smarter. \n\nThe conference, which has become renowned for its “over-the-top brilliant and extremely famous” speakers, fills my head with insights I would have never had, introduces me to trends I would have never seen coming, and explains aspects of the economy and the markets that it would take me years to understand otherwise. I remember sitting in the audience several years ago as a young CEO described a technology his company was working on. When his words finally clicked, I jotted in my notebook, “This could change EVERYTHING.”\n\nThat was Sam Altman letting us know #AI and OpenAI was coming. \n\nMy brain after this conference makes me SUCH a better teacher and guide to people trying to figure out what to do with their lives, because of what I know about where the economy is actually going. \n\nWhich is why I 🩶 love 🩶 attending. Also, Miami in February is not a bad thing. (See photo.☀️)\n\nOK! Let’s carry on! \n\nThe conference, however, or more specifically its aftermath, left me wondering if people might be approaching the point of new-stuff saturation. I mean, could it be 🚨 newphobia 🚨 is creeping in?\n\nWhen I got home from the conference, I was euphoric, but I noticed something different for the first time. Whenever I started to share all the futurist ideas and oncoming changes I heard about with friends…eyes began to glazeth over.\n\nAt first I thought it was me being extra, but then one friend and another and another started to say things like, “Wow, ok. So that’s enough, OK? I just can’t take in any more change.” \n\nA few data points does not make a trend. But I’ve gotten enough pushback on my reports from Miami that I am thinking that maybe, as a society, we might be reaching some kind of tipping point with non-stop upheaval. And if that’s true, what will it mean for all of us?\n\nThat question makes me go hmm. How about you?\n\nIf you’re wondering HOW to increase your currency, I’m having a free, free, totally free 30-minute webinar to share how I stay current (and why it’s so important).

    "Suzy Welch's post 1mo ago": "The crazy thing about being a professor is how much you learn every day. I mean, you’re supposed to be doing the teaching, right? And of course, usually you are. But this week, I was with my students when media icon Joanna Coles did a star turn as a guest in my “Management with Purpose” class at NYU Stern School of Business. Her insights were many and various, but one in particular left me shooketh, and I was not alone.\n\n💣 “Trust only happens in person.” 💣\n\nJoanna dropped this truth bomb when I asked her how, as the chief content officer of Hearst's Hearst Magazines, she’d managed to oversee 300 different magazines around the world. She quickly responded that she’d built trust with each publication’s editorial and business leaders. I pushed again – “How?”\n\n“Well, face-to-face,” she replied, “because that’s the thing, isn’t it? Trust only happens in person. It can’t really grow without actually being in the same room, having a meal, having a laugh, talking –”\n\nAt which point, I snuck a glance at my students to see who was still breathing. Because I knew that these words were not, shall we say, music to the ears of all of them, e.g. the ones still holding onto the hopes of careers of remote or hybrid work.\n\nAre they music to yours? \n\nThey are to mine. In fact, I love them. Because they are so true.\n\nLook, I adore working from home as much as the next dog person. But I also know that business cannot happen effectively and efficiently without trust. Relationships cannot be real without trust. And trust, well, you heard what Joanna said. \n\nHow’s your pulse?",

Too many parts, because I love them all so much! \n\nBut I was motivated. Not everyone can come to NYU Stern. But everyone should have a chance to answer the question, “What should I do with my life?”\n\nFor weeks, my team and I put our heads together to come up with an accelerated version of Becoming You. But until it was all over on Saturday, we didn’t know if it would work. \n\nParticipants told us it had. 😁\n\nI would be lying if I said I didn’t walk into that classroom scared out of my wits. People had traveled from across the country to attend, taken hours of pre-testing, given up a day of their lives, and put their hard-earned money on the line. \n\nThe stakes felt high because they were.\n\nToday, I am a different person for having been stretched and rearranged in the way only good fear can manage to do. And I’m grateful. \n\nWhat are you scared of today? And is it time to ask, “What’s the upside of doing it anyway?”",

They work AGAINST you.\n\nThat was my point just recently on The Today Show NBCUniversal, where we were talking about the annual “NEW YEAR, NEW YOU!” hullabaloo, in which scads of people declare January 1 the day when everything is going to change in their lives. https://lnkd.in/eKEEbrQF\n\nOut with the old – in with the shiny, reinvented version of oneself.\n\nExcept that rarely happens, right?  \n\nChange – real change – is too hard. We want change. Many times, we need change. But then we try to make change, and boom, we hit our first roadblock, and then our next.

Good news, though! A proven methodology is ready to help.  \n\nDiscovery Day: The Becoming You Experience, an accelerated, one-day version of my career-discovery course Becoming You, is coming to NYU Stern School of Business’s campus on Saturday, February 1, 2025. My plan is that you walk out the door with nothing short of a new sense of purpose and a roadmap to your future.\n\nAre you wondering, “But how?” Read on!\n\nIn the first part of the Discovery Day, we will work together to excavate your unique core values, deploying six of my tested self-discovery exercises, which I happen to love because they’re fun, but also, and mainly, because they’re remarkably effective. We will then move on to assessing and pinpointing your underlying aptitudes with a series of scientifically validated tests, and after that, we will explore which kinds of jobs, industries, and/or megatrends are the best match for you.  \n\nDiscovery Day concludes with each participant using Becoming You’s synthesis process to craft their own “Area of Transcendence,” the purpose that lies at the intersection of their values, aptitudes, and interests. \n\nIf this all sounds intense, truth be told, it is. In academic settings, Becoming You involves 24 hours of instruction. Other Becoming You workshops cover its material in three back-to-back, eight-hour days. The Discovery Experience is different. Much of its testing occurs before we convene, and it is, for lack of a better term, an exercise in “extreme learning,” requiring a certain kind of commitment and focus from its participants. But we’ve seen it work time and again, and we know it can be a great fit for those who want and need Becoming You’s outcomes as quickly and efficiently as possible. \n\nSpace for Discovery Day is limited, and please know that a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, an academic center committed to advancing the study of self-discovery and meaningful careers. \n\nFor more detailed information, including an FAQ, click here: https://lnkd.in/eb_Ed_GT I hope to see you there!",

Who, for instance, hasn’t called themselves a “good listener?” Thought so!\n\nSame goes for the term “adaptable.” Suddenly, that’s what everyone claims to be. \n\nExcept…are we really? How can we even tell?\n\nGood news, here’s a hack. In my recent Becoming You podcast conversation with Daniel Roth, the Editor-in-Chief of LinkedIn and LinkedIn News, he suggested that we take a look at how tightly we hold on to how things are done. Not why. Not if. Not when.\n\n➡️ How. ⬅️\n\nI love this advice because it’s immediately actionable. The next time someone asks you to do something differently at work or in life, stop and watch your reaction. Do you instantly get riled up? Do you start to feel a resistance ball form in your chest? Or do you pause and think, “Hmm, interesting. Worth a try!”\n\nI had just such an opportunity for self-observation today when a team member suggested we use AI to write a piece of content that’s been on my to-do list for a long time. Now, let it be noted, I hate this particular task – it’s a caption-type thing – but still, it’s been MY job.\n\nThen: “Let’s see if the Suzy Bot can do it!” my colleague brightly offered. \n\nWith Dan’s advice at the front of my mind, I paused. I will admit, a tweak of “nfw” came over me. But then, just as quickly, I almost felt giddy. “What a cool idea!” I said.\n\nThat’s the good news. This old gray mare is, it seems, adaptable. The bad news is that the Suzy Bot delivered a D-minus product, so Real Suzy still has a job. For now!\n\nAnd maybe for the time being too, because I’m taking Dan Roth’s advice to heart. Stop, ponder, and welcome every new how.",

Indeed, my class at NYU Stern School of Business, \"Becoming You: Crafting the Authentic Life You Want and Need,” was created precisely to help students find such a thing.\n\nBut the ➡️ perfect ⬅️ job? I don’t think so. Because the truth is, every job involves some sort of trade-off, even the best of the best. \n\nTo get meaning, you sometimes have to compromise on a bigger salary.\n\nTo get a bigger salary, you sometimes have to give up a little on meaning, or convenience, or balance, or self-determination.\n\nI don’t base this assertion on a new research study. I base it on thousands of pieces of empirical data from a career of, well, studying careers. Do you agree? \n\nI’m going to bet that most of you do – and yet, I will also suggest that you never stop looking for a job as close to your definition of perfect as you can find, one that exists at the intersection of your values, aptitudes, and interests. \n\nThat can be a journey – and not always an easy one. But it’s always worth it, and you don’t even need to take it from me! My own daughter is case in point, and her personal (and poignant) story is at the heart of this week’s Becoming You podcast episode. I love her for sharing it.\n\nAnd I also love its central truth. No job is perfect, but we should never surrender the search too soon.",

Which is that you should collect mentors like Pokemon cards and trade them the same way. Yep.\n\nLook, the received wisdom is that young people should latch onto a powerful, brilliant, older, wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi type, who will protect and guide them as they criss-cross the career universe all their lives long.\n\nOops, the problem is, such a mentor does not exist, and this never happens. It’s nonsense.\n\nThat’s why I advise my students at NYU Stern School of Business to see everyone they meet as a mentor – because everyone knows something you don’t. Everyone is better at something than you. Everyone can teach you something, even if it’s just a little something, about how to operate and thrive in this world. \n\nAnd guess what? They don’t even have to know they’re your mentor while they’re at it. \n\nFurther – as soon as you get such mentors into your collection, you should tell other people about them. Why not? It’s always wonderful to help other people, and in the best case scenario, those same people will return the favor with, “Hey, check out this person too…”\n\nIn that spirit, here are two of my mentors for you to add to your pack, the great Hoda Kotb of NBC News, and the brilliant Wendy Suzuki, a colleague at New York University. I cannot more enthusiastically recommend you to follow them, take in their many lessons about life, growth, overcoming adversity, and self-discovery. I do – everyday.\n\nBecause that’s how mentoring should work, and it can.\n\nAll you have to do is drop your favorite “mentor card” in the comments below. ⬇️",

But when I arrived, it turned out I had missed the memo. It was indeed a speech; just me on the stage with 200 very sharp and very professional people in the audience. My heart filled with terror and self-recriminations. Fellow over-achievers, do you feel me? \n\nBut then I thought, \"Heck, I know my story and I know my stuff. These women are wonderful. I'm just going to get up there and talk to them like friends.\"\n\nAnd just like that, I gave one of the most joyful, enjoyable speeches of my life. I relaxed, went on a tangent or two, told stories I rarely tell, and found the time to stop and laugh at myself along with the audience. I can't lie. I kind of loved being unprepared.

And it hurts a lot.\n\nI was reminded of this eternal business truism when my family convened recently to take our newest member on her first museum trip. We picked the Temple of Dendur installation at The Metropolitan Museum of Art because, with a 2-year-old in the stroller, we were definitely going for the “wow” factor. \n\nIt worked. But what wowed me along the way – remember, I’m a management professor – was learning that the Roman Emperor Augustus built the temple in 10 B.C. essentially to convince his newly conquered territory that, sure, there was a new leader in town, but they had nothing to worry about. He got Egyptian values and traditions. He respected them. Look, he’d even build a huge monument proving it!\n\nThe rest, literally, is history.

    "Suzy Welch's post 5mo ago": "With the DIRECTTV and DISH Network announcement, another big merger is in the news, which can only mean one thing. Three deadly sins are about to be committed by the leadership of both companies. They won’t mean to! But most mergers have a way of being a lot messier than they should be. And who pays the price? Employees for starters, but customers and shareholders too. (From LinkedIn News's Emma W. Thorne: https://lnkd.in/ePCCVs7S) \n\nMy husband Jack Welch and I originally wrote about these merger “sins” about 20 years ago in our book WINNING. And I still teach them in my NYU Stern School of Business class about management. Let’s just say, sadly, that they have stood the test of time. Consider:\n\n1. The first merger sin occurs when leadership claims there has been a “merger of equals.” That’s exactly the case with DirectTV and Dish. As any business veteran will tell you, such a thing only exists in theory. In the real world, leaders would be better off quickly and candidly identifying who’s the new boss, so that employees can plan their lives and careers accordingly.\n\n2. The second sin occurs when leadership pays excessive, and sometimes exclusive, attention to strategic fit instead of cultural fit. Talk about putting the cart in front of the horse! If anything good is to come of this merger – or any – a healthy new, consolidated culture must come first. Culture is how work gets done, and to quote the great Peter Drucker, it eats strategy for breakfast.\n\n3. The third merger sin is related to the first. It occurs when leaders engage in what I call “timid integration,” with both sides tiptoeing around each other to see where the landmines are buried. It’s human – but that doesn’t make it a best practice. With good leadership, a full integration should take no longer than 90 days. That’s right, 90 days.\n\nLook, mergers are hard to get right, but companies keep doing them for a reason. They hold so much promise! Here’s hoping the leaders of DirectTV and Dish can fulfill theirs by avoiding the mistakes so many executives have before them.",

Try giving it! \n\nEvery manager – every human being – struggles with delivering a tough message in a way that will be heard and yet not hurtful.\n\nThere is a solution. It’s called the OILS approach, invented by Emily Field, a partner at McKinsey & Company, whom I am fortunate enough to bring to my class NYU Stern School of Business every semester.\n\nOILS guides managers through delivering feedback with four steps.\n\n\t✴️ You start with an observation, literally. “Can I make an observation,” you might say to a team member, “I noticed you interrupted the client a lot in our meeting yesterday.”\n\n\t✴️ Next, you talk about impact. “We have so much to learn from the client, and we could be missing critical information about their problem if they think the conversation is just a one-way street.”\n\n\t✴️ The third step of OILS is the hardest. You have to listen. You have to give the chance for the feedback-recipient to respond. People want to explain themselves, and deserve that opportunity.\n\n\t✴️ Finally, you turn to creating a solution together. You might suggest, for instance, that you come up with a secret signal if you see an interruption happening. Oftentimes, the feedback receiver also has solutions to offer, and that’s all for the good.\n\nWhenever Emily visits my class on managerial skills, my students leave smarter and wiser, and so do I! Giving feedback is never easy, but OILS greases the way.",

Years ago, they instituted a policy to allow well-behaved, supervised dogs at the office. It’s obviously great for the dogs, CEO Kitty Block told me. But, she added, “During a tense meeting or a difficult moment, the empathetic presence of a dog can make connections easier and serve as a breath of fresh air.”\n\nTL;DR: Bring on the dogs. As management edicts go, it’s certainly cheaper and easier than replacing good people who want to work in the office, but just can’t say goodbye to the one thing keeping them sane.

(By the way, that's me at a panda sanctuary in Chengdu, China, an experience I'll never forget, because bears are, well, heavy and smelly.)\n\nAnother plea while I'm at it, for the experts in digital product manager hiring. Best questions to ask? Traits and skills to look for? I don't want to be blinded by someone just loving the product, that's my weak spot. So any \"Snap out of it, Suzy!\" advice is most welcome.\n\nThank you. 🐼  And now back to work. ✍",

    "Suzy Welch's post 6mo ago": "Recently, I woke up with a slight headache, and horror – yes, horror – filled my heart. Not because I feared Covid, but because I’m off the charts on a value I call “Workcentrism,” which is a measure of work as your life-organizing principle. How about you? Does a sick day fill you with dread because you love work that much? Welcome to the Workcentrism Club. \n\nIf you’re one of the GenZers that Business Insider and LinkedIn News reports are embracing “guilt-free sick days,” I’m going to guess Workcentrism is not exactly high on your values list. You might, instead, value what I call “Eudemonia,” a measure of wellbeing, pleasure, and self-care as a life-organizing principle. https://lnkd.in/etA9-aW4\n\nNo harm, no foul either way! I am a values agnostic – everyone has a right to their own values. \n\nBut isn’t it nice to have a language to talk about values at all? I recently created just such a thing for my class “Becoming You” at NYU Stern School of Business, where the whole point is creating a career plan based on personal values (as well as aptitudes and economically viable interests). \n\nI had to! Because over the years of teaching, I kept finding that it was too hard, too fraught, and too confusing to talk about values as typically we do today – with judgment, inferences, and assumptions. The Gen Z sick-day debate is a perfect example. Values debates just get so personal fast. \n\nAre you intrigued by a language that helps us all talk about values without acrimony and with clarity? If so, let me know in the comments ⬇ and I’d be happy to start posting about the 15 values in my lexicon. \n\nValues matter – to everything. Work, life, and the balance between the two. Isn’t it time to take down the Tower of Values Babel and find a shared language for true discussion?",

But I’m lucky that way, because if my research is correct, you probably don’t know yours.\n\nYour values, that is. Yes, I’m serious.\n\nWe talk about values at work and at home all the time – they matter. But my recent research at NYU Stern School of Business shows that only 17% of respondents who were asked, “What are your values?” could supply an answer. Most checked the box for “Don’t know,” or listed words that could best be described as virtues, such as “generosity” and “kindness.” Only a smattering of the 400 respondents, aged between 22-45 and in professional jobs, answered, “financial security” or “money.”  \n\nBecause that’s another thing about values. Even when we know our own, they can be hard to admit out loud. They’re personal, or we fear they might strike other people the wrong way. \n\nIn my class Becoming You, we spend two weeks doing activities and exercises that help us identify our values in gritty and serious detail. (For instance, Pierre and coffee are not technically values, but both reveal truer, deeper ones around self-determination and belonging.) Such inquiry is absolutely essential to the larger purpose of the class, which is answering the question, “What should I do with my life?”\n\nBut I would make the case that knowing your values is essential, period.\n\nIf you don’t know yours, my advice is to start trying to figure them out today. Books abound, and so do courses. And if you have 40 minutes to spare, you might also attend my totally free digital workshop on August 27 at 5 PM EST (link is the comments).  \n\nLook, values matter, as I said. If you know yours, let us know below how you got out of the 17%. ⬇️ If you don’t, keep searching. The sooner you find them, the sooner you can live into them, perhaps even with a crazy little pup (or two or three) by your side.",

Then and only then can you get on with gathering all the other important data you need, such as an individual’s values, aptitudes, and interests.\n\nBecause people can be flexible about a lot of things.

There is just better and worse FIT when it comes to professions and roles. \n\nExample. Some people have brains that are incredible at sorting out big, gnarly, ambiguous projects. Other people excel at focusing on immediate problems in exquisite, operational detail. The difference is not about IQ!

In short, 10-10-10 asks users to take any decision they cannot seem to make, or one that happens to be highly contentious, and consider the consequences of each possible option in the immediate future (10 minutes), the foreseeable future (10 months), and the future they wish to create (10 years). \n\nOnce that data is gathered, 10-10-10 asks you to compare it to your values. In most cases, the right answer will quickly present itself, and in such a way that you can explain it to everyone.\n\nNow, to be clear, I myself can’t conduct a 10-10-10 analysis for the president. I don’t know his values. I’m not sure anyone does at the moment. \n\nWhich is important. Because if you’re a leader, explaining what drives you is part of the job. Not everyone will like what you say. That also goes with the territory.\n\nFew decisions as a leader are easy, and the more complex they are, the more you need a transparent process. 10-10-10 delivers that. \n\nPresident Biden, what are you waiting for? 😉\n\nOr any leader really. Because our decisions are not just for us to understand. They are for everyone that they impact.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the 10-10-10 method, check out my YouTube video: https://lnkd.in/eWNnaehW",

    "Suzy Welch's post 8mo ago": "Do I stay or do I go? It’s one of the hardest decisions we ever make in life…but let’s just talk about work here. 💼 \n\nOver the years, I cannot count the times I’ve been asked, “What do I do about my toxic boss?” I just answered this exact question on my podcast.\n\nIn my answer I suggest asking, “Is my boss just a bad boss, or a bad person?”  If it’s the former, stay and wait, and try to mentor from below. An art if there ever was one, but possibly worth it. \n\nIf he or she is a bad person, start packing your bags. Such a relationship never ends well.\n\nOn this topic, I also like to point to 🚦The #StayOrGoMatrix 🚦 I use to teach management at NYU Stern School of Business. It plots Good/Bad Company against Good/Bad Boss.\n\nTwo quadrants are easy. If you have a bad boss at a bad company, it’s like the movie says, GET OUT. If you have a good boss at a good company, celebrate. \n\nThe other two dilemmas are trickier. Here’s my advice.\n\nIf you have a bad boss at a good company, wait. Truly good companies will smoke out a bad boss in time. Let the system work for you, even if it means some hard days…or months.\n\nIf you have a good boss at a bad company, though, prepare your departure documents. Just hope your good boss doesn’t beat you to the door. High quality managers don’t stay at bad companies very long.\n\nThis is a big topic, and I’d love to hear other thoughts on it. Opine below!",

    "Suzy Welch's post 9mo ago": "“You just don’t value fun, Suzanne.” The accusation stung like a bee 🐝 because it was…true! And I’m still trying to fix that!\n\nThe year was 1988. I was about to graduate from Harvard Business School, and a classmate asked if I was coming to a big shindig that night. “No!” I snapped, witheringly, “We have class tomorrow!”\n\nWhat an utter bore I was. (Also a goody-two shoes nerd trying to land a signing bonus at Bain & Company for my GPA.)\n\nLife went on, and I continued to not be very good at fun.\n\nWhich is a value by the way. \n\nSome people have fun as the organizing principle of their lives – that’s the definition of a value, in my book – and other people not so much.\n\nLook, I adore work. Surprise! But I am doing something radical soon, with the marked purpose of increasing my “Eudemonia.” That’s the technical term for personal enjoyment that we use in my NYU Stern School of Business class “Becoming You: Crafting the Authentic Life You Want and Need” where all we do is talk about personal values.\n\nGet this: I’m teaching my class – immersive, intensive style – in ITALY. (First week of September if anyone wants to come along. 🇮🇹 🙃) I haven’t been to Europe since my family and I visited our homeland of Sicily in 2018. That’s me and Sophia in Taormina. Think White Lotus, only happier!\n\nI’m so excited I could faint! First, about teaching Becoming You to a small group of learners away from the classroom – new experience! – second, about doing it in the Tuscan countryside, and third, about realizing that it’s never too late to tweak a value or two and see what happens.\n\nLike…Italy!",

Nick Carraway didn’t think so. “And so we beat on,” he ruminates at the end of The Great Gatsby, “boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” \n\nIf he’s right – and, yes, I get that he’s a fictional character – then there should be no “Becoming You” at NYU Stern School of Business, not to mention all its stories of transformation. \n\nI believe he’s wrong. And I hope so.\n\nBut I put his contention out there because one of the things we’re doing at the new NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing is developing curriculum that might help people make sense of their lives. To help them find meaning and direction.\n\nI am wondering today if we can teach a class – a business class – through novels. I myself took just such a course when I was at Harvard Business School, taught by the renowned psychiatrist and writer, Robert Coles, author of more than 80 books. Although it was 36 years ago, I can still remember reading everything from the poetry of Williams Carlos Williams to John Kennedy Tooles’s raucous and complex, “A Confederacy of Dunces.”\n\nI think I learned more in that class about human nature than any other in my entire education. And what must we know about to thrive in business if not human nature?\n\nSo, thoughts? Should we pursue developing an MBA class based on great novels? And if so, which would you include? I vote for The Great Gatsby, because it feels so important to talk about our capacity for change. \n\nAnd affirm that we can. Perhaps even by reading.",

You never hear their story or tell yours, but somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted.” —Steve Jobs.\n\nThis clip of Steve Jobs inspired me to look back over this past year of writing about human creativity in many of its forms and against the background of the burgeoning use of AI on MBH4H. I’m not sure whether Ross Miller 🔜 GDC and I have made something wonderful, but at least we have made something creatively fulfilling for us and, hopefully, for our subscribers and everyone else out there in the world who has read any of the words we’ve written.\n\nHere’s to the crazy ones.",

It was a cathartic way to process my thoughts on the iconic novel I had just finished. Sketching and moving pixels is a great way to let my mind wander.\n\nBefore I started, all I knew was that I wanted the artwork to feel like a cyberpunk book cover. I had seen other designers break up the word Neuromancer on their covers, but I chose NEU / ROM / AN / CER to highlight “ROM,” a reference to ROM Construct in the book.\n\nThe word Neuromancer is also, annoyingly, 11 letters long. To fill the gap after “AN,” I added four dots—referencing the four dots Gibson uses as line breaks in the text messages Molly (a cyberpunk “Razorgirl”) reads on the inside of her mirror lenses.\n\nI built the letters in Adobe Illustrator, then glitched and distorted the image in Photoshop to mimic a CRT screen—a nod to Neuromancer’s 1984 release. The three colorways draw from the old Sony Trinitron logo’s green, blue, and red. And, of course, the whole creative process began with sketching. I believe in pencil before pixel.",

I photographed Jags for a number of editorial and book projects and made numerous trips to the Gaydon factory in England (some for Aston Martin).\n\nThe Jaguar brand has meant a lot to me professionally, and personally. My father spent years restoring a Jaguar Mark II in British Racing Green with a louvered bonnet and wire wheels. It was stunning.

The car was brought home to the UK from Singapore; switching the car back to right hand drive became a significant part of the restoration.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just classic Jags, my dad also owned an XJ6 in the late 1990s. He even managed to persuade the dealer to fit it with the wire grill from an XJR. Vroom, vroom.\n\nYet as much as my father loves Jaguar, I do not. Well not really. I respect the marque, but it’s never even occurred to me to buy one.\n\nAll of which is to say I have very mixed feelings about the rebrand: I kind of hate it, but I also admire it too.

And that, I agree, is a genuine concern.\n\nAs AI becomes more prevalent it stands to reason that it becomes increasingly more important to disclose exactly when an image has been manipulated; it's a safety issue.\"\n\nThis quote is from an essay I published yesterday on MBH4H. Later that same day, The Verge's Chris Welch published an incredible set of pictures using Google's \"reimagine\" feature as part of his review of the Pixel 9 phones, and... well, the photos speak for themselves.\n\nChris managed to add car wrecks, a helicopter crash, drug paraphernalia, and even corpses in a crash scene to his photos in a matter of seconds just by typing a prompt.\n\nAs I wrote in my piece yesterday, all of these photo editing techniques have been available to photographers for decades. However, this level of retouching was time-consuming, difficult, and required powerful computers.\n\nBut what I find genuinely alarming is that there is nothing to alert the viewer to the fact that the image has been altered (except deep down in the metadata). It's not so much what \"reimagine\" can do but the speed with which it can do it.\n\nYesterday, I wrote that putting these AI tools in phones \"is a genuine concern.\" After seeing the photos in Chris's review, that was a monumental understatement.",

I'd argue it has nothing to do with AI; it's just a brilliantly executed idea that an iPad has all the creative tools you'll ever need.
