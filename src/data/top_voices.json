    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 5mo ago": "In the eyes of skeptics, #crypto has been \"dying\" ever since it was born. For those declaring crypto \"dead,\" history certainly has a way of proving otherwise.\n\nNot long ago, skeptics dismissed crypto and #blockchain as passing trends, especially during bear markets like 2018 and 2022. But the data tells a different story. The global crypto market cap, which peaked at over $2 trillion, is surging, with institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity embracing #Bitcoin #ETFs. Ethereum processes over 1 million transactions daily, powering DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized apps. Meanwhile, 425 million people globally own cryptocurrency—a 39% year-over-year increase. Blockchain technology isn’t just surviving; it’s thriving, evolving from speculation into a tool reshaping industries.\n\nBeyond digital currencies, blockchain’s potential to disrupt industries is enormous. Imagine mortgage processing reduced from weeks to hours with smart contracts automating compliance and execution. Tokenized real estate could enable fractional ownership and unprecedented liquidity, while supply chains use blockchain to ensure transparency and authenticity. Blockchain has the power to redefine sales contracts, healthcare records, intellectual property, and more—any system relying on trust and intermediaries can be transformed.\n\nNow, pair this innovation with #AI. AI can analyze blockchain data to detect fraud, optimize smart contracts, or even predict market trends. Together, these technologies could create autonomous, self-executing ecosystems in finance, real estate, and beyond. We’re at the cusp of a new digital era where blockchain and AI don’t just coexist—they amplify each other, unlocking unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and innovation. For those still declaring crypto and blockchain “dead,” it’s clear we’re only getting started.\n\nFor any industry to thrive safely, and protect consumers, it needs clear legislative frameworks, legal regulation and oversight, and customer protection. Clear rules can prevent fraud, protect consumer funds, and boost innovation by giving businesses and investors confidence. Prioritizing transparency, accountability, and security ensures blockchain and digital assets become tools for progress, not crime, fraud and misuse. Digital assets regulation isn’t a barrier—it’s the foundation for a trustworthy and scalable future.\n\n(At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin spot price is $106,787 - an all time high. Crypto's future has never been brighter, and this is only the beginning)",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 9mo ago": "Some general thoughts on the state of Generative AI:\n\n- Unstructured data remains the biggest opportunity areas for innovation. Interestingly, it's also also the least invested in. \n\nI spoke about this last year at a prominent Tech Week conference. 80%-90% of the world's data is unstructured. This data is mostly disjoined, uncollated, way under-analyzed. It's also incredibly valuable. Cutting across virtually every industry, unlocking unstructured data with Generative AI is a complete world game changer. It is a hard problem to solve, which is why so few companies and start-ups are trying to solve it. But whoever successfully cracks this Goliath will become a Fortune 100 company.\n\n- Start-ups in Generative AI continue to build LLM wrappers around the major Large Language Models (the easy out). The LLMs themselves are also building a lot of the same tech, which is leading to both an AI bubble in VC investment, as well as AI start-ups having an increasingly difficult time growing into their valuation. Just as with digital, mobile, crypto, etc., few companies will actually emerge as winners in the long-run.\n\n- Search as we know it is changing. People increasingly use LLMs to get more precise search results than Google is providing, either via a free or subscription model. Eventually, a search provider will emerge that will offer ad-free search by subscription that mimics or betters the current search engine experience. \n\nAdvertising-based search is both controversial and archaic. Consumers will pay a premium for a great product (see Netflix, InstaCart, Uber, etc.). \n\n- The newest Llama release (Llama 3.1) is absolutely amazing. I've worked with the 4 major LLMs since their beta release, and right now, LLama 3.1 is leading the pack. It is absolutely fascinating to watch this race, with every major LLM outdoing the other on an almost weekly basis. It's also fascinating to see how the initial dominance of OpenAI, and the gold rush to that, is now being disrupted by something as terrific as Llama which is an open-source product.\n\n- The above is creating a new version of the Windows vs. Linux competition. Who wins, ultimately? Consumers. Expect usage prices for LLMs to drop, and  innovation to continue and accelerate\n\n- Compute is the world's most valuable commodity. I remarked last year that the race in 2024 will be the GPU/chipset race. nVidia has been the clear winner to date - kudos to them for the innovation they have brought. However, LLama 3 is training on Qualcomm, Gemini on their own TPUs, Anthropic on AWS's Trainium chips. Others are pushing the innovation envelope. \n\nPay attention to the other players in the GPU/chipset game - and for VCs/Founders, invest in/invent tech that optimizes model training costs. \n\n- As popular as generative AI has become, we are literally sitting at \"we've just invented the wheel\" stage. So much more is coming. Strap in, and buckle up :) \n\n#generativeAI #LLM #nvidia #OpenAI #Llama #Gemini #Anthropic #Innovation",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 9mo ago": "As #bitcoin prices near all time highs again, and #ethereum ETFs begin to trade, I chuckle a bit at blockchain/crypto pessimists whose thesis that \"crypto has no value, no utility, it's fake, it won't make it, etc.\" has not only been proven wrong, but proven colossally wrong. \n\n\"Crypto Winter\" absolutely needed to happen. There were too many scams, too many bad actors, and ambiguity around regulation (which, in part, still exists, in the US more than anywhere else). However, if memory serves, very similar things happened in the late 90s/early 2000s with OTC/penny stock trading, \"pump and dump\" schemes, and so on. We didn't stop trading stocks. We regulated the market, took enforcement action against the bad players, and brought things towards normal.\n\nThe people that don't believe in #crypto don't understand three things: One, the utility of #blockchain technology (which will disrupt literally every single industry in one form or another). Second, the dire need for innovation in banking and conventional finance (cFI). Interestingly, they're the incumbents, and for decades, they haven't been forced to innovate. They're also the ones that are screaming the loudest against decentralized finance (deFI).\n\nWhich brings us to our third and most important point - the need for a *REGULATED* (yes, I absolutely support meaningful regulation in crypto), decentralized financial marketplace that is not tethered to a government sponsored banking system. As the utility of crypto grows worldwide, especially in third-world countries where inflation is rampant and consumers are underbanked, alongside the increased adoption of digital currency, the value of deFI increases exponentially.\n\nFor those that insisted that crypto was dead for the past 2 years, sorry that you were on the wrong side of the trade. It happens. If this is still your thesis, I respectfully suggest educating yourself on crypto/blockchain. Even given the advent of Generative AI, the blockchain is still the world's most disruptive technology to date, and that genie's never going back in the bottle. It will only grow bigger and change the world as we know it.",

We delved into lessons from major setbacks, drawing from a real-life example during my time at Amazon. This experience (my podcast debut) was truly invigorating - and a helpful reminder that the initial nerves fade away quickly, and the deer in the headlights look is temporary :).\n\nI'm still excited to announce my own podcast, \"Start With 'I' Can,\" set to launch in a month at the latest.

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 1yr ago": "One of my favorite topics to debate in generative AI is hallucinations, and the actual need for their existence (not \"eliminating\" them, as just about every generative AI company infers)\n\nWhat are hallucinations, exactly? AI \"hallucinations\" were defined in the 1980s in computer vision. Computer vision scientists began using the term to describe how their models would \"fill in\" missing or ambiguous image details – much like our own brains do – often resulting in improved overall image quality. This concept of generating non-existent but plausible features proved beneficial in several applications, such as image restoration and super-resolution. In my and my team's early work on Project Blackbeard and AWS Rekognition, we actually leveraged AI hallucinations to enhance images\n\nAs Generative AI took a prominent, user-facing role in today's technology, the term \"hallucination\" is now used to describe when models confidently assert something that's factually incorrect. Today's generative AI can and does \"hallucinate\" facts, with serious consequences in fields like engineering, science, and medicine\n\nShould we eliminate hallucinations entirely? No - and truthfully, we actually can't. In creative fields, hallucinations are the engine of innovation. Generative AI's ability to generate novel ideas is actually what makes it so powerful. The solution lies in software as the solution - another play on SaaS? :) - that does the following:\n\n- Adapt to context, adjusting the \"hallucination\" level based on the task and field, enforcing strict constraints for factual domains, and creative freedom for others\n\n- Encourage collaboration between human experts and AI models (Human-In-The-Loop). Human oversight can catch and correct hallucinations, ensuring that the AI’s outputs are both innovative and accurate. This partnership leverages the strengths of both human intuition and machine efficiency\n\n- Ensures transparency and explainability. Develop AI systems that can explain their reasoning and the sources of their information. Transparent AI models allow users to understand how conclusions are drawn, making it easier to identify and correct hallucinations when they occur\n\n(personally, I believe transparent AI is an absolute necessity, and will eventually be required by law, as AI legislation is actively being shaped. Companies that get an early start here will have a huge competitive advantage in the not too distant future)\n\nOur AI future is ultimately a collaborative dance, involving a harmonious partnership between human and machine. We can leverage AI's generative power while maintaining our critical thinking and ethical judgment. By acknowledging the dual nature of \"hallucination\" and designing software that embraces its creative potential while mitigating risks, we can unlock a new era of innovation and expression and drive progress and across a wide range of fields and industries\n\n#AI #GenerativeAI #Creativity #Innovation #Hallucination #Engineering",

    "Nick Ciubotariu's post 1yr ago": "After what seems like a lifetime (23 years) in the corporate world, I'm taking a self-initiated and very intentional break from work to recalibrate and give myself the opportunity to be very introspective about what comes next, life and career-wise. This past Tuesday was my last day at Nasdaq. I leave with nothing but reverence and respect for the company and Adena Friedman, who is truly the best CEO in the game. They were incredibly supportive of my decision to take a life break, and I absolutely LOVED my time at Nasdaq - a world class company that lives their values every day. Truly a bittersweet departure. \n\nTaking stock of my career, I'm frankly surprised of how far I've come. In 2001, I was a starry-eyed database developer, and (for the moment) ending as a Fortune 500 SVP and executive seems unreal in so many ways. I'm grateful for every step in the journey, grateful to everyone that took time to help me grow along the way, and especially thankful to all the folks that worked for me. Whatever success I've had, the credit is really theirs.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n- This is the first time in 23 years that I've jumped without a parachute, so to speak. I don't take it for granted that I have the ability to do so, and I don't intend to waste the opportunity. I truly don't know what comes next. A few companies have already contacted me, for which I'm humbled and grateful (and certainly listening as others reach out!). I'm going to be incredibly discerning about what I do next from a professional/career perspective, with a focus on a mission driven differentiator.\n\n- I'm going to use my voice and experience to help others. A podcast is launching soon, named \"Start With I Can\", alongside a book with the same title, that will cover my journey and experiences throughout my career, and what I've learned. The name comes from the life-changing advice my good friend Arvind Sethuraman gave me back in 2011, while we were colleagues at Microsoft. Thank you Arvind - it literally redefined the way I think. I'm also going to be building some interesting products, from scratch - stay tuned for more!!\n\n- I'm going to decompress, reconnect with family and friends at a deeper level, and find ways to give time (the most precious commodity we have) back to those close in my life, and others who need it. \n\nThere are too many people to thank who unselfishly and givingly helped me on my journey. You know who you are, and you have my forever gratitude. \n\n(in order: Reliant Energy, bp, Microsoft, Amazon, Bright Machines, Venmo, PayPal, Nasdaq - thank you for everything).\n\nI'm excited, apprehensive and slightly terrified :). Today is, as always, #DayOne",

In an incredibly tough family situation, and chatting with/counseling a Director level executive who is beyond excellent and has literally hung moons for their company, but who, through circumstances not of their making, delayed a delivery and is getting squeezed and criticized from/by their management.\n\nFirst, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES. None of this actually matters in the scheme of overall life. In 30-50 years, we'll be lucky to still be alive and we absolutely won't remember what happened at work on this day or that day. Work actively to make your family your VERY FIRST priority, not just say it. It's worth it.\n\nSecond - if you're a manager and you have an employee that's struggling with something, especially one of your absolute stars (but really anyone), how about instead of starting with criticism, you start with this:\n\n\"I'm really sorry this situation didn't go as planned. Don't let this get to you. You're an absolute rock star and I know and appreciate everything you've done for us. Is there anything I can do to help make this easier?\"\n\nMy God, really, how hard is that? How about showing GRATITUDE, COMPASSION, EMPATHY, APPRECIATION, and offering HELP, instead of criticizing in the moment - especially for someone who flat out kills it for you and is a 10X force multiplier? \n\nI guarantee you that an extraordinary performer is already self-flagellating, criticizing themselves, and looking at every angle where they could have done better. \n\nThey don't need their boss doing it FOR THEM, not at that moment. They need empathy, positive reinforcement, and support from their leader. They need PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY. They need to know that their boss understands, and has their back. And that above everything else - IT'S OK. The moment to triage and do lessons learned will come, but that's later.\n\nI have never understood why the majority of managers choose in the moment micro aggression and criticism instead of empathy and support. The former are two of the biggest demoralizers and attrition-inducers that exist in the workplace. Do better or you'll find your regretted attrition spike, and your 10X force multiplier hanging moons for your competitors. \n\nYou can be a performance driven leader and be empathetic at the same time. As a matter of fact, you have to be. The top down, aggressive pressure  leadership culture of yesterday is no longer acceptable or welcome.\n\n#leadership #management #culture",

They're having one of their best years. What was the key to their success?\n\n\"We don't believe in building armies. We hire really good people, pay them well, and run lean. And we've always run and operated our company like we are in a constant bear market, and we are relentless about delivery and results\"\n\nFrugality matters. You don't have to go to extremes - making money requires spending money, but lavish, excesses, bloat and inefficiency are all massive anchors that, especially in hard financial times, drag companies right to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nI took away a lot of lessons from Microsoft in the Ballmer era, mostly on what NOT to do (I have equally been stunned and impressed by Satya and the company's transformation since), and from Amazon on how to run a lean, focused and results/delivery driven organization. \n\nThe next time any company attracts you with free lunches, yoga classes, massages and organic gardens, etc. as perks, ask yourself whether this is truly company money well spent, and how that is helping that company deliver results, win business and keep customers happy.\n\n#leadership #pragmatism",

Thank you LinkedIn family and truly humbled]\n\nEveryone, I'm excited to announce I'm starting a podcast! Over the past two years I've been encouraged by multiple folks to do this, and I hope I'm able to both give back and learn through this process. We'll cover technology topics in general, from ongoing trends to innovation to leadership, as well as recount war stories and industry lore, so to speak. \n\n(I'm also taking suggestions for podcast names. My brain is terribly wired to the left, and I have an almost nonexistent creative side when it comes to naming and branding. Please help if you can lol).\n\nI will also focus on professional/life topics helpful to those just starting out in tech, and I, along with guests, will share our experiences, mistakes, successes, good/bad managers, workplace heroics, horror stories, moments of note, etc. I have 4 guests already lined up and I'm pretty excited to do this, and hope to be able to give back from my experiences and those of my guests, as well as continue to learn and grow in the process.\n\nHelp wanted: I need to buy a decent microphone and some other equipment. Would be very grateful for any direction/recommendations from experienced podcasters, and would be equally grateful for whatever tips/tricks/guidance they can provide for having/running a successful podcast.\n\nPlease feel free to DM me for above, and likewise, please DM me if you're interested in being a guest speaker. More details soon!!\n\n#tech #leadership #podcast",

You have to fix it right away\"\n\nYou (confused): \"This is already in our backlog as a P2/P3.\" Or: \"We decided not to take this bug because we have an upcoming release that fixes it and have higher priority items to work on this sprint\". Or: \"This isn't a bug, it actually works like this by design - remember when we had that meeting and we wanted user flow/color/whatever to be this?\"\n\nManager: \"Yes, but so and so hates it so we need to drop everything and fix it right now.\"\n\nThis is one of the WORST POSSIBLE THINGS you can do to any dev or dev team. It's disrespectful, demoralizing and LITERALLY derails projects, breaks builds, randomizes entire teams, and severely harms engineering morale. As a Dev, it happened to me many times and I can't remember one instance where the urgency was actually valid, and I didn't hate the experience.\n\nExecutives: STOP DOING THIS. Seriously. Ask questions instead. \"I found this bug, or what I think is a bug. Please help me understand if there are plans to fix it, or please educate me on why this works the way it does\". Don't just knee jerk and fire from the hip.\n\nManagers: HAVE BACKBONE, and respectfully but firmly give your folks aircover. \"I understand and I'm sorry. This is actually in our backlog to fix on xyz date.\" When they insist \"Please understand that this would break our build/derail the team/slow down overall release and progress\". Or. \"We decided as an organization that it should work this way and this is by design, but we're happy to re-raise this at our next ship room/product review/whatever meeting\".\n\nThis is also a great opportunity for managers to familiarize execs with how to file bugs. Most execs don't know how (in my opinion they absolutely should) \"Have you filed this in Jira? Would you like to know how?\" If they refuse: \"I am happy to file this on your behalf and will keep you posted on progress.\"\n\nObvious exceptions are P1/P0 bugs, but that's almost never the case here and teams know how to handle those anyway in emergent fashion with all hands on deck.\n\nHave patience, trust the process, protect your team and folks. Use good judgement, take time to educate, be pragmatic. Not everything's a fire or needs to be. In fact, most things aren't. \n\n#dobetter",

Cryptocurrency has long passed the \"market test\", as it were. Its use cases have exploded - crypto is here to stay and being incubated in our lives more and more on a daily basis.\n\nHowever - until security, scalability and performance and trustworthiness are taken seriously, cryptocurrency will never gain institutional acceptance. The example below would never be acceptable with a traditional bank, custodian, exchange or retailer, and is the exact reason why cryptocurrency has not gained greater (and well deserved) traction among large financial institutions, public companies, pension funds, etc. \n\nThe frequent security breaches, exchange downtime during high liquidity events, disregard for needed regulation, rug pulls, and most important, shrugging off these events as \"another day in crypto\" by the respective company operators absolutely have to stop, because just as with fiat currency, real people lose money and it's absolutely not okay.\n\nIn my opinion, cryptocurrency is the greatest technical invention of our lifetime. However, the prominent players in crypto are just NOT addressing the fundamentals: security, scalability, trust and regulation with the same levels of well deserved professional paranoia as they would if they were handling fiat currency (read dollars, euros, gold etc) on behalf of their customers. \n\nUntil that happens, crypto will remain a mostly retail, speculative product - hurting its adoption and ability to truly change the world.\n\n#cryptocurrency #security #scalability #trust",

For every company this has happened at, at least in my experience, this turns into a Microsoft Exchange outage within hours, if not minutes, due to immediate load spikes, and email becomes unavailable or at the very least unusable.\n\n... Except at Amazon. The one \"unsubscribe me\" event at Amazon that I was a part of turned into a movement. The trolling interest DL was added to the thread. People banded in unison to try to take down Exchange. Which turned into someone replying all with the Exchange performance graphs. Then the party really started.\n\nOne developer requested a \"ship it\" on a trivial pull request. Which quickly received thousands of \"ship-its\", some with little ships drawn as comments. Some took the time to advertise used silverware, appliances and video game consoles for sale. Many others viewed this as an opportunity to ask for opinions about everything from investment advice to fitness tips and everything in between. And so on. We were all united in one goal: take down Exchange. The volume of email had exploded and the ripple turned into a tidal wave.\n\nWithin 3 hours or so, someone stepped in and blocked the offending DL from receiving emails. No punitive action was taken, as far as I can remember. And while the PMET graphs showed clear load spikes, Exchange running on AWS never even as much as blinked. \n\nMoral of the story? Learn from everything, and never waste a good crisis. Oh, and fun matters. Anything can be fun, even (and maybe especially) an innocent mistake.\n\n#culturematters",

Some of the most salient parts:\n\n****\n\n“Choked innovation. By its very nature, innovation disrupts the status quo. And yet it’s the lifeblood of growth. Innovation is also a social process that requires divergent thinking and courageous conversations. Pervasive niceness suppresses this process, creating an intellectual muzzle that can turn teams of exceptionally talented people into dysfunctional groups. I frequently work with institutions that desperately need to boost innovation but their nice cultures slow the speed of discovery.”\n\nProvide air cover for candor. When people do have the courage to express dissenting views and speak candidly, protect them. Reduce the risk of ridicule by thanking those who do. As you accommodate dissent, you will gradually recast the norm until it becomes a cultural expectation.\n\n*****\n\n#innovation #work #leadership #accountability",

Two of these elevators are out for the foreseeable future, leaving residents with extended wait times and, needless to say, tons of frustration. Apparently they have to custom-make these parts somewhere and we won't have a fully functional elevator bank until June at the earliest.\n\nOne day this month, coming home with a few groceries, I got tired of waiting. So I took the stairs up. TWENTY TWO floors, double flights. By the time I got to my floor I was hallucinating. That signaled that while I thought I was in great shape, my cardiovascular resistance could use some work.  Now I take the stairs down down and up, once a day. It's been getting easier every day.\n\nMorals of the story:\n\n- Stuff's gonna break in life (the elevators)\n- Don't worry about the stuff that's out of your control (the elevator parts)\n- Control what you can (the stairs)\n- There's always another way (take the stairs)\n- You can learn from any situation (need better cardio!!)\n- Always look for silver linings (taking the stairs == better cardio)\n\nLast, and most important:\n\n- Don't wait for someone else to determine your destination or how fast you get there.

This is not only a misconception, it can be disastrous if the strategy to culture turnaround is viewed as a \"big ship turnaround\".\n\nTurning a culture around involves turning around a bunch of canoes AT THE SAME TIME. If a company has 50 thousand people, for instance, it's not a big boat that has 50 thousand occupants that has to turn. It's 50 thousand canoes that all have to turn in the same direction, at the same time.\n\nMost leaders automatically default to the ship, because they're the captains of \"some big thing\" - (a ship). The reality is, the reason the culture has to turn around is because not only is everyone not on the ship, not everyone that's in a canoe is rowing/paddling in the same direction in the first place.\n\nSee the difference? Which one is harder? And more important, which one more closely mirrors reality? If you lose sight/focus of the fact that there's more to the culture than \"the big boat\", the canoes will bump into each other, flip over, and either row away, drown or create general chaos.\n\nMoral of the story: be the lead rower and shepherd, not the captain. There's a difference. And bring all the canoes along, as smoothly as possible. \n\n#leadership #culture #change",

On the surface, it sounds like great news for creators. But after more than a decade hosting Tech Talks Daily, I’ve seen this space grow from grassroots passion projects to highly produced shows with Hollywood connections.\n\nIf you take a look behind the headline, the big question is whether the indie podcasters who built the foundation of the medium are really benefiting?\n\nIn my latest piece for Cybernews, I look at what Spotify’s payout reveals about the growing divide between independent creators and celebrity-driven productions. \n\nI look at how podcasters can qualify for Spotify’s partner program, why the push to video podcasts may benefit influencers over audio-first storytellers, and whether creative ownership is quietly being sacrificed for short-term visibility.\nThis isn’t about bitterness.

What if it helped train the next generation of AI?\n\nThe viral trend of turning ourselves into action figures using generative tools is fun on the surface, but it might also be a signal of what is coming. Behind every AI-generated selfie or avatar is a data exchange that could reshape how we create, connect, and even how machines learn from us.\n\nReports suggest that OpenAI is quietly exploring its own social network built around ChatGPT and real-time image creation. This wouldn’t be a feed where you simply scroll through updates. It would be a place where content is co-authored with AI, conversations are shared between people and machines, and every interaction feeds a broader training model.\n\nUnlike Meta, Google, or Elon Musk’s platforms, OpenAI doesn’t currently have direct access to a constant stream of human behavior, reactions, and preferences. A social feed could change that. It would be more than a content platform. It would be a living data engine.\n\nFor brands and creators, this could transform how audiences are reached and engaged. For users, it introduces new questions around transparency, authorship, and control. If AI helps write your post, edit your image, or reply to your comment, how much of it is still yours?\n\nIs this the start of something exciting or a shift that demands more scrutiny?\nWould you be comfortable in a space where every post contributes to AI training in real time?

It might be a cost-saving strategy.\n\nIn my conversation with Oz Krakowski from Deepdub, he shared something that could completely shift how you watch film and television. Dubbing, especially for global distribution, comes with significant costs. And the more speaking characters a production has, the more expensive it becomes to localize that content.\n\nThis is especially true for children, who are often more expensive to dub due to stricter labour rules and voice matching challenges. As a result, shows may limit how many lines kids have, or even how many characters speak at all. You’ll see background actors, even central characters, remain silent while the story unfolds around them.\n\nNext time you stream something on Netflix or Prime, take a closer look. Who's actually speaking? Who's just miming or reacting? You may start to notice the subtle ways cost control is influencing storytelling.\n\nThis clip is a reminder that the economics of global entertainment are far more nuanced than they appear. AI dubbing is starting to change that, making it easier to preserve creative intent without sacrificing global accessibility.\n\n🎧 Watch the clip and let me know – did this change how you view dialogue in TV and film?\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e_hth78J\n\n#Technology #AI #Podcast"

But can it nail blue steel?\n\nWhat happens to fashion when the camera stops rolling and the models are no longer physically there?\n\nH&M’s recent move to create AI-generated “digital twins” of 30 real-life models is being framed as a win for efficiency, scalability, and even sustainability. \n\nOn the surface, it’s a compelling case where models can be in multiple campaigns at once without stepping onto a plane, brands cut emissions and costs, and the models retain ownership of their digital likenesses.\n\nBut beneath the innovation lies a more complex picture.\n\nFashion has always thrived on spontaneity, chemistry, and storytelling, the magic that happens between takes, the human energy behind the glamour. Can that truly be captured by an algorithm, no matter how advanced? And if these AI clones eliminate the need for crews, stylists, makeup artists, and location scouts, what happens to the creative community that supports the industry?\n\nThe environmental claims are also under scrutiny. Replacing flights with servers sounds cleaner, but training generative AI has a sizable carbon cost of its own. \n\nThen there’s the longer-term concern: when a model’s likeness becomes a licensable asset, what does digital identity really mean—and who controls it five years from now?\n\nThis isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about holding space for ethics, creativity, and humanity as the fashion world adapts. If we get this balance right, it could be a powerful evolution. If not, we risk making the industry more uniform, less inclusive, and ultimately less human.\n\nWhere do you stand on fashion's digital future?

End-user computing (EUC) meant managing devices, not experiences. \n\nFast forward to 2025, and many employees now spend over 75% of their working time inside a browser. In many cases, it's the only application they need.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nThe shift to SaaS, the explosion of remote work, and the growing complexity of security threats forced organizations to rethink everything, from device strategy to infrastructure. The browser quietly became the new desktop. And with that came new models for security, manageability, and scalability.\n\nAt IGEL Technology's #NowandNext25 conference, Mark Templeton put it succinctly: “The browser is now the computer.” It was a tipping of the hat and clever updating of Sun Microsystems' historic mantra, \"The network is the computer.\"\n\nIt marked a realisation that modern EUC isn't about the hardware, it’s about secure, seamless access to the tools people need, wherever they are.\n\nThis shift isn’t just about convenience. It’s also about reducing risk, extending device lifespan, lowering environmental impact, and making IT more responsive.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\nAs we step into this next chapter of EUC, the questions become even more interesting: Can we maintain security and flexibility at scale? How do we support innovation without leaving legacy systems behind? And what does the rise of browser-based workspaces mean for the future of operating systems?\n\nI'd love to hear how your organisation is adapting to this shift.

      " Hughes's post 2mo ago": "Zig Serafin, CEO of Qualtrics unveiled AI 'experience agents' on Day One of the X4 summit. But the message is that the future of customer experience isn't just speed. It's human connection\n\nBillions have been spent on automation, AI-driven workflows, and CRMs in the pursuit of efficiency. But let's be honest, who wants to be \"optimized\"?\n\nAt KFC, the magic isn't just in speed or technology. It's in creating finger-licking experiences that keep guests coming back. As Rob Swain, Global Chief Operating Officer at KFC, highlighted on stage at X4, that means balancing the power of AI-driven insights with the human moments that make a difference.\n\nFrom a single franchise in Salt Lake City to 30,000+ locations worldwide, KFC has evolved alongside rising customer expectations. The modern quick-service restaurant (QSR) space is no longer just about drive-thru and counter service, it's an intricate web of delivery, kiosks, and digital interactions. \n\nWhile technology has created more convenience for guests, it has also introduced complexity for frontline teams. Here's the real challenge: How do you use technology to enhance, not replace, the human connection?\n\nKFC partnered with Qualtrics to transform guest and team member insights into real-time action, ensuring that every experience, whether in Johannesburg, Bangkok, or Lima, feels seamless. \n\nWhat was the ROI? A 300% increase in customer feedback records, faster decision-making, and a new era of predictive analytics to anticipate guest needs before they arise.\n\nBut the real takeaway (see what I did there) isn't just about tech, it's about listening, acting fast, and making every interaction meaningful.\n\nSo, here's the question for every business: Are you using technology to understand your customers and employees, or are you just optimizing?\n\nHow are you balancing automation with human connection in your organization?\n\n#X4SLC #Qualtrics #QualtricsX4 #BestAdvice #Technology"

I spoke with several AI and cybersecurity leaders to explore this intersection of innovation and regulation:\n\n🔹 Juan Orlandini, CTO of North America at Insight, breaks AI risk into three categories: creators, adapters, and consumers—each facing distinct challenges. \"It is 100% opportunity,\" he says, but only for those who build AI responsibly.\n🔹 Bindi Davé, Deputy CISO at DigiCert & Global Ambassador with the Global Council for Responsible AI highlights the critical role of AI governance. She emphasizes transparency, ethical guidelines, and \"red teaming\" to mitigate risks and build stakeholder trust.\n🔹 Randy Weakly, Chief AI Architect at ImageSource, discusses how AI capabilities are already embedded in everyday tools like HubSpot, Adobe, and GitHub Copilot—often unnoticed by IT and security teams. He warns that a lack of oversight could lead to unintended consequences.\n🔹 Manoj Kuruvanthody at Tredence Inc., stresses that AI governance must be proactive, not reactive. He advocates for real-time risk assessments and AI audit frameworks to align with global regulatory standards. \"Traditional compliance mechanisms won’t be enough,\" he cautions.\n\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into business operations, the balance between innovation and compliance will define success.

With AI, hybrid cloud, and high-performance computing generating massive storage demands, enterprises need a new way to access and orchestrate data across edge, data centers, and the cloud.\n\nHammerspace is having a breakout year, reporting 10x revenue growth, fueled by the rising demand for AI storage and hybrid cloud solutions. At the heart of this success is its Global Data Platform, which eliminates data silos and ensures seamless access to unstructured data—no matter where it resides.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from our discussion was the role of Parallel Network File System (pNFS) and why it’s becoming a game-changer for enterprise storage. Unlike traditional storage architectures, pNFS separates metadata from data, unlocking extreme parallel performance without the usual bottlenecks. But as David explains, storage performance alone isn’t enough—true data orchestration is the missing piece.\n\nWe also explored why global namespaces alone are not a solution, and how Hammerspace is combining them with data orchestration to create a system that moves, accesses, and utilizes data efficiently across distributed environments. This shift is critical as enterprises struggle to keep pace with AI-driven analytics, GPU computing, and hybrid cloud strategies.\n\nWith its recent recognition as TechTarget’s Storage Product of the Year and a new Chief Revenue Officer joining the team, Hammerspace is scaling rapidly to meet the evolving needs of AI-powered businesses.\n\nSo, what does the future hold for AI storage and enterprise data management?

It’s a silent reminder that no company, no matter how dominant, is immune to disruption.\n\nFacebook moved into the former Sun Microsystems campus in 2011, but instead of replacing the sign entirely, Mark Zuckerberg had it flipped. The message was clear: stay hungry, stay adaptable—or risk becoming history.\n\nSun Microsystems was once a titan of the industry, pioneering open-source software, Java, and powerful workstations that fueled the internet’s early days. Yet, despite its technical brilliance, it failed to navigate changing market conditions and was ultimately acquired by Oracle. \n\nToday, the Sun logo remains hidden in plain sight, a lesson for all innovators and tech leaders.\n\nThe same dynamic plays out across the Valley. Apple Park stands where Hewlett-Packard once defined an era. Tesla occupies the site of the former NUMMI auto plant. Reinvention is constant, and survival depends on anticipating the next shift before it arrives.\n\nIt’s easy to celebrate success, but the true lessons lie in understanding what happens when companies fail to evolve. Seeing this sign in person was a moment of reflection—how will today’s giants ensure they don’t become tomorrow’s cautionary tale?\n\nWhat other reminders of Silicon Valley’s past have you come across? Would love to hear your thoughts.\n\n#IPT #Technology #Innovation #Future"

Will it spark engagement or dismantle democracy, one algorithm at a time?\n\nYuval Noah Harari offers a stark warning: “Democracy is a conversation, and conversations rely on language. By hacking language, computers could make it extremely difficult for large numbers of humans to conduct a meaningful public conversation.” \n\nFacebook and Instagram were once digital town squares, but today, AI-generated influencers, auto-generated posts, and bot-driven interactions are replacing real human engagement.

      " Hughes's post 6mo ago": "Back in 2011, Apple introduced 5GB of free iCloud storage for iOS and Macbook users—a generous offering at the time, when the cloud seemed limitless, and digital clutter was far from most people’s minds. Fast forward thirteen years, and those 5GB feel more like a digital drop in the ocean.\n\nToday, millions of users wake up to the dreaded notification: ‘iCloud storage is full.’ A simple backup of photos, messages, and apps becomes an ongoing frustration, leaving many feeling cornered into upgrading.\n\nIs it convenience, or coercion? Starting at $0.99 for 50GB, stepping up to $2.99 for 200GB seems reasonable for safeguarding cherished memories. But what happens when 200GB doesn’t cut it anymore? \n\nFor those juggling multiple devices and years of data, the leap to 2TB at $9.99/month highlights the real cost of convenience—and the feeling of being locked into a system where the price only goes one way.\n\nUK-based Consumer rights group Which? filed a $3.8 billion lawsuit against Apple on November 14, 2024, on behalf of 40 million UK iPhone and iPad users.\n\nAre storage pricing tiers like these solving problems—or creating new ones? What’s your take on the iCloud dilemma? Let’s discuss in the comments.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/etwwU9Dj\n\n#Cloud #Technology #Future #Mobile"

But he seems to squeeze a lot of impact into those hours. How? \n\nMeticulous timeboxing.\n\nHe doesn't just schedule work meetings. He blocks time for everything, down to sleep, waking up, and even free time.\n\n“Free time is critical because that's the release valve,” Andreessen says. “You can work full tilt for a long time as long as you know you have actual time for yourself coming up.” \n\nHe's observed that executives who are scheduled to the extreme suffer from three major problems:\n\n1. They never have time to actually think (which is “fairly important,” he notes dryly).\n2. They struggle to adjust to changing circumstances.\n3. They constantly feel they’re putting out fires.\n\nThe most successful people, like Andreessen, maintain their success by diligently planning their days, so they can be sure they’re making time for what matters most. \n\nLike them, your calendar should reflect your values.

They're reminding you that you're the kind of person who reaches for a Coke when you're thirsty.\n\nTech companies, on the other hand, don't need to constantly remind you to use their products because they've built habit-forming hooks directly into the user experience.\n\nThe products themselves—through triggers, actions, variable rewards, and investments—create their own hooks, pulling you back again and again.\n\nThis is why understanding the psychology behind habit-forming products is so important, whether you're building a product or simply trying to use technology mindfully.\n\nWhen you understand how products capture your attention, you gain the power to decide when and how you engage with them.\n\nSign up for access to the Product Psychology lessons here: https://lnkd.in/ebnR8bM8",

It's to learn how much you can accomplish when working without distraction, which creates a feedback loop for better future planning.\n\nTo-do lists give you the satisfaction of checking little boxes, even when you're doing irrelevant work. Timeboxing forces you to make tradeoffs so you focus only on what truly matters.\n\nThe five tips below will help any timeboxing beginner transform their relationship with time. \n\nRead the full article on my website to learn how to master this powerful time management technique: https://lnkd.in/ezdhQrAU",

Timeboxing helps by committing specific calendar time to focused work, eliminating the decision of \"when\" to tackle it.\n\n2. Breaking large tasks into smaller chunks reduces the psychological weight and makes starting easier.\n\n3. Creating an effort pact, like using website blockers during writing sessions or working alongside an accountability partner, adds just enough friction to prevent distraction.\n\nThese are evidence-based strategies for managing the internal triggers that drive us to procrastination.\n\nWhich ones have you tried? \n\nGet my free and customizable schedule maker template to create your own timeboxed weekly calendar in an easy-to-use Google Sheet: https://lnkd.in/eebP2-tk",

Master Internal Triggers: Recognize that distraction starts from within. When uncomfortable emotions like boredom or anxiety arise, learn to handle them without escaping to distractions. \n\n2. Make Time for Traction: You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it's distracting you from. Schedule your day according to your values, not just your to-do list. If you don't plan your time, someone else will.\n\n3. Hack Back External Triggers: The pings, dings, and rings in our environment constantly pull at our attention. Ask yourself: \"Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it?\" Keep helpful triggers, eliminate harmful ones.\n\n4. Prevent Distraction with Pacts: Create precommitments that make it harder to get distracted. Use effort pacts to increase friction, price pacts to add financial incentives, and identity pacts to leverage your self-image.\n\nI spent five years creating this model, and what I found is clear. \n\nWe live in a more distracting world than ever before, and that problem will only grow more complex as technology improves. \n\nBut with the right skills, we can enjoy the many benefits of technology without getting lost in it. \n\nThat’s why the ability to stay focused and resist distraction is the single most important skill for thriving in the 21st century.\n\nWant to learn more about becoming Indistractable?

Thou Shalt Require a Clear Agenda\n\nNo agenda, no meeting. Period. Every meeting must have a structured plan outlining what problem needs solving.\n\n3. Thou Shalt Prepare a Briefing Document\n\nBefore calling a meeting, write a 1-2 page digest outlining the problem, your reasoning, and your recommendation. Do the thinking work first.\n\n4. Thou Shalt Communicate Asynchronously First\n\nShare information and gather feedback through email, Slack, or collaborative documents before considering a synchronous meeting.\n\n5. Thou Shalt Not Hold Status Update Meetings\n\nRoutine updates can be handled through asynchronous communication. Save meetings for discussions that actually require real-time interaction.\n\n6. Thou Shalt Keep Meetings Brief\n\nShorter is better. Stand-up meetings can effectively keep discussions focused and prevent rambling.\n\n7. Thou Shalt Ban Devices\n\nRequire all attendees to leave their devices at the door.

    "Nir Eyal's post 1mo ago": "Humans cling to outdated beliefs, even when they could be killing us. \n\nThis explains why doctors once rejected handwashing despite overwhelming evidence it saved lives. \n\nOr why decades of Alzheimer's research followed a single theory despite mounting contradictions.\n\nBut why do we do this? \n\nIt’s because of the way we each experience and construct our realities. \n\nOur brains actively generate our experience of reality based on expectations. It uses those expectations to make predictions about what you think you’re seeing. \n\nBut these predictions are so powerful they literally CHANGE what we see. \n\nWhen new information contradicts your existing beliefs, your mind often filters it out automatically.\n\nSo, to break free from limiting beliefs, we must systematically retrain the brain’s predictive machinery through repeated exposure to new evidence and experiences.\n\nThis is why transforming deeply held beliefs takes time and practice. Your brain needs to build new neural pathways that support expanded possibilities.\n\nFor more insights on how your mind shapes your reality, follow me and subscribe to my free newsletter: https://lnkd.in/e3xrWpEj",

We hatched a (doomed) plan to do so: \n\nWe printed party invitations at Kinko’s (if you don’t know, ask your parents), placed them in every mailbox, and waited. \n\nAnd waited. \n\nAnd waited.\n\nNot a single person showed up.\n\nWhat I learned then that every new adult must learn is that building (and maintaining) adult friendships is a different beast than those that came before. \n\nBut as challenging, and at times uncomfortable, as forging new friendships can be, it’s necessary for your health. \n\nResearch shows that weak social ties are as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and twice as harmful as obesity.\n\nEventually, my wife and I did find a great group of friends, but those bonds were tested by competing priorities—work, family, hobbies. \n\nThe solution I discovered to maintaining these bonds with my friends transformed my happiness. \n\nWe call it \"the kibbutz\"—a bi-weekly gathering that has become the most important ritual in my social calendar.\n\nSwipe to learn how it works and why regular connection with close friends is too important to lose. \n\nFor more science-based insights on building habits that bring joy to your life, subscribe to my free newsletter: https://lnkd.in/e3xrWpEj",

Self Compassion: \n\nWithout self-compassion, you will not be resilient to failure. As Brené Brown discovered in her decades of research, we must embrace failure because it’s part of the path to progress. \n\nFailing means you’re trying. \n\nTo build self-compassion, share failures with others to normalize the experience and reduce feelings of isolation.\n\n2. Positivity: \n\nPsychologist Richard Wiseman found after a 10-year study that resilient people use positivity to transform setbacks into opportunities. \n\nThey attempt things precisely because they believe they can succeed.\n\nWhen you can approach failure with self-compassion and positivity, it will not derail you. \n\nHow are you building resilience? \n\nTo learn more about the importance of failure and how to respond to it, click here: https://lnkd.in/dNvB4xHb",

    "Nir Eyal's post 1mo ago": "I used to say \"Comparison is the thief of joy.\" I was wrong. Here's why:\n\nResearch now shows that comparison doesn't have to be toxic. It can actually fuel our growth.\n\nThis all depends on how we frame it: \"benign envy\" motivates us while \"malicious envy\" tears us down. \n\nWe must be mindful of our feelings when we compare ourselves with others. \n\nHere are 7 science-backed ways to make comparison work for you:\n\n1. Check Your Mental State Before Scrolling\n\nUpward comparison during low moments can trigger negative spirals. Wait until you're in a positive headspace.\n\n2. Build Authentic Self-Esteem\n\nTrack and celebrate your progress to develop secure self-esteem that leads to benign envy rather than malicious envy.\n\n3. Practice Active Gratitude\n\nWhen comparison triggers negative feelings, redirect your focus to what's going right in your life to boost satisfaction.\n\n4. Remember the Incomplete Picture\n\nEveryone is struggling with something, even if it's not visible on social media or in their public persona.\n\n5. Get Specific About Your Envy\n\nList exactly what triggers your envy and why. Use this information to identify your true goals and aspirations.\n\n6. Define Your Own Success Metrics\n\nDraw inspiration from others but ensure you're working toward your own definition of success aligned with your core values.\n\n7. Let Go\n\nInstead of unfollowing successful people, follow them mindfully and transform envy into genuine admiration.\n\nSocial comparison is hardwired into our psychology—we can't shut it off. But we can harness it to illuminate our path forward rather than letting it divert us from our journey.\n\nLearn more about healthy social comparison here: https://lnkd.in/efVqKF83",

Open to anyone. \nMy focus? Fragmented by every meeting request and notification.\nThe result? I was constantly busy but rarely productive.\n\nEverything changed when I implemented this non-negotiable: I stopped letting other people run my calendar.\n\nThree key insights from my journey:\n1️⃣ Most workplace distractions aren't about willpower—they're systemic, built into our work culture and habits. The solution isn't trying harder; it's redesigning your environment.\n2️⃣ Time-blocking isn't selfish; it's strategic. By protecting space for deep work, I actually deliver more value to my team and organization.\n3️⃣ The people who appear \"always available\" aren't necessarily the most productive or valuable. Often, they're the most distracted.\n\nThis boundary-setting practice became so instrumental to my success that it formed a cornerstone of my book \"Indistractable.\" The research was clear: the most productive people aren't those who say yes to everything—they're those who fiercely protect their attention.\n\nWhat's your non-negotiable for staying focused and effective?

Behavior excuses sound like \"I don't have time,\" \"I forgot,\" or \"I'm not sure what to do next.\" These can come up when you know what you want and believe you can do it, but lack clarity on the specific actions to take.\n\n2. Benefit excuses sound like \"I don't feel like it,\" \"I'm tired,\" or \"It's too hard.\" These emerge when the rewards seem too distant or unclear compared to the immediate effort required.\n\n3.

    "Nir Eyal's post 1mo ago": "Why do we fail to achieve our goals? It's not lack of resources or opportunity.\n\nThe simple answer: we quit too soon.\n\nAll human motivation requires three components working together: behavior, benefit, and belief. Just as fire needs fuel, oxygen, and heat to burn.\n\nWithout the right balance of these three elements, motivation fizzles out. When we understand what's missing, we can diagnose why we're struggling:\n\nBehavior: When you don't know exactly what to do, how to do it, or aren't able to do it, motivation fails. This is why vague goals like \"get healthier\" never work.\n\nBenefit: When the reward doesn't feel worth the effort, we lose interest. The most powerful benefits are intrinsic—competence, autonomy, and connection to others.\n\nBelief: The foundation that sustains motivation. When we believe we can't do something, we won't even try. To achieve our goals, we must expand what we perceive as possible.\n\nUnderstanding this triangle is the first step to achieving what matters most to you. \n\nWhen you can identify which component is missing, you can fix the real source of your motivation problems.\n\nWant to learn more about the psychology behind motivation?

    "Nir Eyal's post 1mo ago": "Which type of professional time dominates your workday?\n\nMost of us aren’t very intentional about how we spend our professional time. We just try to keep up with the endless stream of emails, meetings, and notifications.\n\nBut this reactive approach is killing your productivity. \n\nWhen you spend all day in Management Time (answering emails, attending meetings), you leave no space for the Creation Time that actually moves projects forward.\n\nBut you must also squeeze in Consumption Time (reading, learning) and Ideation Time (brainstorming, reflecting) for innovation. Yet, most of us schedule zero time for either.\n\nThe solution?

Knowledge Is Power:\n\nThe T-Factor: This simple calorie guide changed my life as an overweight kid. Understanding food's nutritional content empowered me to make better choices and take control.\n\nGet a Financial Life: After watching my brother fall into credit card debt, this book taught me the incentives and traps in personal finance, showing me how knowledge enables better decisions.\n\n2. Beyond Rational Choice:\n\nAddiction by Design: Natasha Dow Schüll reveals how gambling machines keep \"whales\" in the \"machine zone\"—a semi-conscious state where they escape their troubles, not play to win.\n\nMemoirs of an Addicted Brain: Neuroscientist Marc Lewis explains the brain chemistry of addiction from personal experience, showing why people choose specific drugs to fill what's missing in their lives.\n\n3. Theory Into Action:\n\nThe Power of Habit: Charles Duhigg's book inspired me to write Hooked, as I saw the opportunity to apply habit psychology to help companies build products that create positive user habits.\n\nDeep Work: Cal Newport's book convinced me of focus's importance but left me wondering how to actually stop getting distracted. This led me to write my second book, Indistractable.\n\nMy journey has taught me that understanding human behavior is the foundation for creating meaningful change in our lives and work. \n\nHave you read these books?

Is everything okay?\"\nThis question gives them two options: \n\n1. Excuse themselves to handle a genuine emergency\n2. More likely, realize they're being rude and put their phone away.\n\n\"Phubbing\"—phone snubbing—is contagious. \n\nWhen one person checks their device, others follow suit. It's classic social contagion, similar to how smoking spreads in groups.\n\nBut just as society developed social antibodies against smoking in shared spaces, we can develop norms that protect our attention during social interactions.\n\nThis approach is effective because it doesn't shame the person.

Instead, use timeboxing to visualize and schedule your time realistically.\n\n2. Liminal Moments are dangerous transition periods when we think \"just checking email for a minute\" won't hurt. Combat these with the 10-minute rule: When you feel the urge to check something, wait 10 minutes. The urge often passes.\n\n3. The Mere Urgency Effect tricks us into prioritizing quick, unimportant tasks over meaningful work. Schedule focused work sessions and communicate them to colleagues to protect your important projects.\n\n4. Productivity Shame keeps us stuck in a cycle of toxic self-criticism. Break free by practicing self-compassion. Talk to yourself like you would a friend. Accept that obstacles are part of growth.\n\nWhich of these mental traps impacts you most? \n\nLearn more about these traps and how to beat them here: https://lnkd.in/ewqGcXiv",

One study found that focusing on how we can become more like these role models often leads to genuine inspiration. \n\nOur envious feelings often point to our deepest desires, even when we’re unaware of them.

That if you just find this magical state, hard work will suddenly become easy?\n\nHere’s the truth: Flow isn’t designed for hard work.\n\nResearch shows that flow happens when we’re deeply engaged in activities we already enjoy—like playing sports, painting, or solving puzzles. But what about the tasks that feel boring, frustrating, or just plain hard? That’s when we tend to seek distractions.\n\nThe solution isn’t to chase flow—it’s to build mental resilience for the work that doesn’t feel fun. Here are three strategies that help:\n\n1️⃣ Redefine the discomfort – Instead of seeing boredom or frustration as barriers, see them as signals that you’re doing meaningful work. The ability to sit with discomfort is what separates high achievers.\n2️⃣ Use the “Just 5 Minutes” rule – If a task feels overwhelming, commit to just five minutes. Once you start, it’s easier to keep going.\n3️⃣ Create external structure – Timers, accountability partners, and clear deadlines remove the need for motivation and force action.\n\nHard work isn’t meant to be easy—it’s meant to be done. The better you get at managing discomfort, the more you can achieve.\n\nNow, I’d love to hear from you: How do you get through the work you’d rather avoid? What’s your strategy for staying on track?

After seeing hundreds of fertility cases over their long careers, here’s what our care team knows: when traditional medicine says that a patient has “unexplained infertility,” it often means “unexplored metabolic dysfunction.”\n\nConventional fertility testing frequently misses:\n\n- Gut inflammation\n- Subclinical thyroid imbalances\n- Cellular and oxidative stress markers\n- Hidden inflammatory responses\n- Metabolic dysfunction beneath \"normal\" lab ranges\n\nThe problem isn't that these cases are unexplainable. It's that we're looking in the wrong places. When your car's check engine light comes on, you don't declare it \"unexplained\" without first looking under the hood.\n\nThe reality is that your reproductive system doesn't operate in isolation. It's deeply connected to your metabolic health. When your metabolic health is compromised, your body is focused on keeping your body alive and reproduction takes a back seat.\n\nThis is why the future of fertility care isn't about better Band-Aids. It's about understanding that infertility is often your body's way of saying something deeper needs attention.\n\nWhat’s your experience with the \"unexplained infertility\" diagnosis? \n#FertilityCare #WomensHealth #FunctionalMedicine #Healthcare",

Sleep is an underrated infertility treatment. \n\nYour body won't make babies if it thinks it's running from a tiger. And guess what signals \"running from a tiger\" to your body? Bad sleep.\n\nThink about it. When you don't sleep enough:\n• Your cortisol (stress hormone) skyrockets \n• Your reproductive hormones plummet\n• Your metabolism is suppressed\n• Your body thinks: \"Survival mode: ON\"\n\nEvolution is pretty smart about this. If you're NOT sleeping well, your body assumes you're either:\n1. In danger\n2. Starving\n3. Super stressed\n\nNone of these are great conditions for making babies. So your body does the smart thing - it hits pause on digestion and reproduction.\n\nI see this pattern constantly in fertility cases: People try everything from supplements to expensive treatments, but they're sleeping 5 hours a night and wondering why nothing works.\n\nFertility isn't just about your reproductive organs.

This isn't speculation, or even just anecdotal. There’s research that shows that poor gut health impacts:\n\n- 𝗡𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝗼𝗿𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and folate lead to poor egg and sperm quality.\n\n- 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Gut dysbiosis can trigger systemic inflammation, which then can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and other inflammatory conditions that make it challenging to conceive..\n\n- 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝘆𝘀𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 70% of your immune system lives in your gut. When your gut is inflamed, it creates a series of inflammatory responses that can significantly impact reproductive function. \n\n- 𝗘𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗲𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗴𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Imbalances in gut bacteria can lead to too high or too low estrogen levels, which can affect ovulation and implantation.\n\nYet the standard fertility treatment protocol completely ignores this connection. When I see clinics jumping straight to IVF without addressing gut health, it's like watching someone cover up mold with paint instead of removing it from the depths of where it originated.\n\nThis is why at Ferta (formerly Akhanda), we're pioneering a different approach: treating fertility as part of a whole-body system, where gut health plays a crucial role in reproductive success.\n\nThe future of fertility care needs to look beyond just reproductive organs. The answers can lie in unexpected places – like your gut microbiome.\n\n#FertilityCare #FunctionalMedicine #WomensHealth #GutHealth",

Yet, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what causes infertility in the first place.\n\nI realized this firsthand when I was struggling with my own fertility. After 13 years of taking birth control to fix my missing periods and hormonal issues, and then being pushed towards IVF when I was trying to get my period back so that I can get pregnant, I realized something was broken in how we approach fertility care.\n\nHere's what I think most people miss about the infertility crisis:\nWhen reproduction fails, it's rarely just a fertility problem. It's your body's check engine light going off, signaling a deeper, systemic issue. From my research and experience, I now know that this can include:\n\n- Metabolic dysfunction \n- Chronic inflammation\n- Environmental toxins\n- Oxidative stress\n- Psychological stress\n\nIVF success rates are around 15-40% globally, and the odds of success get smaller as women get older. Early research combining functional medicine approaches with traditional treatments shows promising improvements in outcomes - a study conducted with 1000+ infertility patients at an academic fertility center revealed that 80.4% of respondents used at least one integrative medicine modality to conceive. The research is early, but the effectiveness of integrative & functional medicine is too compelling to ignore. \n\nYet most fertility clinics still operate on a symptom-fixing model.\nThis is why functional medicine is revolutionizing fertility care. It treats fertility as a vital sign (alongside body temp, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pain) and views infertility through a holistic lens rather than treating it as an isolated condition.\n\nAt Ferta (formerly Akhanda), we’re implementing this approach firsthand. When we integrate functional medicine diagnostics with traditional fertility care, we're not just putting a bandaid on infertility– instead, we focus on optimizing and balancing the entire body because a balanced body is a fertile body. The results, of course, validate this approach. Patients who address root causes often restore natural fertility without requiring intensive interventions.\n\nThe future of fertility care isn't about choosing between functional and traditional medicine – it's about leveraging both. The next wave of innovation will come from understanding the complex interplay between metabolic health, hormonal balance, and reproductive function.\n\nWhat's your experience with fertility care? How do you see functional medicine shaping the future of reproductive health?\n\n#FertilityCare #FunctionalMedicine #HealthcareInnovation #FertaHealth",

    "Preethi Kasireddy's post 3yr ago": "5 Skills Every Dapp Developer Must Have:\n\n#ONE. Strong technical skills and a passion for learning\n\nLuckily, most of your existing technical skills are transferable. For eg., smart contracts are mostly written in Solidity, which is similar to mainstream programming languages (with some restrictions). For the Dapp front-end, you will be using the same tech that's used to build modern front-end apps.\n\nAlso, Ethereum and blockchain are vast. It is important that you have a passion for learning because the learning never ends.\n\n#TWO. The willingness to learn new and unfamiliar things\n\nDeveloping on Ethereum requires you to learn the new and unfamiliar decentralized architecture of Web 3.0. To be a successful Dapp developer, you have to be willing to be a beginner again.\n\n#THREE. The willingness to unlearn the practices of Web 2.0\n\nUnlearning allows you to be open to accepting new information, especially when it contradicts what you already know. Learning how to build Dapps will require unlearning some of your Web 2.0 skills and relearning how to build things the Web 3.0 way.\n\n#FOUR. The ability to work well with others\n\nSuccessfully developing a Dapp requires a mix of skills, including backend development, frontend development, distributed systems, token economics, marketing, fundraising, and politics. It is important that you be able to work well with others so that you can build a multi-faceted team.\n\n#FIVE. The readiness for an intense, long-term commitment\n\nBlockchains are fairly new technologies that have a lot of unexplored and uncertain parts to them. As a Dapp Developer, you will undoubtedly run into many unforeseen challenges. It is important that you have the determination and perserverance to overcome them.\n\nIf you have these skills (or are willing to learn them), then I can help you become a Dapp developer.

    "Shelly Palmer's post 2d ago": "Yesterday at Anthropic’s first “Code with Claude” conference in San Francisco, the company introduced Claude Opus 4 and its companion, Claude Sonnet 4. The headline is clear: Opus 4 can pursue a complex coding task for about seven consecutive hours without losing context. That leap takes us from last year’s five-minute attention span to what feels like a full work shift at silicon speed.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nIn the GPT-3 era, a five-second task could be completed in roughly five seconds. I projected that by early 2026, a five-month task might be completed in five seconds. Anthropic’s announcement forces me to redraw that curve. Sustained multi-hour autonomy is exactly what a practical agentic system requires. Continuous context, tool use and memory enable an AI worker to accept a ticket, call the right APIs, refactor dozens of files, run tests, and open a pull request while you sleep.\n\nStrategic Lens for the C-Suite\n\n* Agent pipelines become real. If a large language model can own a ticket for most of a business day, leaders can design workflows in which human review brackets the work instead of supervising each step. Productivity gains will appear first in code maintenance, data cleanup, and document generation.\n* Cost calculus shifts to output quality. Opus 4 costs roughly 3-4x more per token than GPT-4o. If it closes tickets with fewer iterations, the blended cost per deliverable can still fall. Run side-by-side pilots that measure human review minutes rather than only model latency.\n* Risk and compliance require new guardrails. Seven-hour autonomy expands the blast radius of an error. Instrument agent chains with hard policy stops, such as repository write limits, approval gates and indemnity clauses, before allowing the model to touch production assets.\n* Procurement gets easier. Immediate availability on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI removes a major deployment hurdle. If your cloud teams have already connected security controls to Bedrock, adopting Opus 4 is essentially an API call.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nAutonomy is compounding faster than most enterprise road maps anticipate. With Opus 4, the gap between call-and-response chatbots and a junior colleague that finishes a ticket has narrowed sharply. Incremental upgrades (such as parallel tool calls, longer context, and local memory files) add up to a qualitative leap.\n\nToday, the ceiling is seven hours; tomorrow, it could span several days or even months. Leaders should plan for a near-term future in which AI agents persist across multiple business cycles, from campaign planning to quarterly closes and research sprints. Redraw your graphs, allocate budget for rapid model churn, and begin experimenting with agentic workflows before competitors do.",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3d ago": "The News/Media Alliance’s blistering statement that Google “just takes content by force” and that its new AI Mode is “the definition of theft” lit up every tech feed. Publishers are right to be angry; Google’s latest search UI hides the familiar blue-link list behind a tab and surfaces a Gemini-generated answer built from their stories without compensation.\n\nThe Alliance has asked the DOJ to fold this issue into the remedies phase of the government’s search-monopoly case. If the DOJ agrees, Google could face structural changes or compulsory licensing. That matters because search advertising still funds the internet. Marketers spent about $252B on search ads worldwide in 2022, according to Statista. Alphabet reported about $198B in “Search & Other ad revenue” in 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit is a rear-guard action. Anyone who watched the full Google I/O keynote saw a bigger story: Google is migrating from search engine to answer engine. Senior vice-president Liz Reid framed AI Mode as the logical next step toward “going from information to intelligence.” In the near term that imperils publishers’ referral traffic; in the medium term it threatens Google’s own business model. When an LLM answers the question inside the interface, there is nothing left to search, and nothing obvious to charge someone for (other than completing a transaction).\n\nLook one step further. We are heading into an agentic web, where software agents act on our behalf, negotiate with one another, and complete transactions autonomously. In that world, there is no results page to optimize for. The top of the funnel becomes an API call between bots. The $252 billion now spent persuading humans to click links moves to persuading agents to execute intents. No one (Google included) knows what the pricing surface will look like.\n\nLitigation cycles run on calendar time; AI product cycles run on exponential time. By the time courts decide whether AI Mode is fair use, the market may have rendered the question moot. The ten-blue-links paradigm is already broken; what breaks next is consumer behavior itself.\n\nExecutives responsible for growth should prepare for an environment where visibility means “addressable to agents,” not “ranked first.” Three near-term moves:\n\n1. Schema everywhere. Ensure product data, prices, availability, and service terms are machine-readable so agents can ingest them without scraping.\n2. Agent-first testing. Start experimenting with agent-to-agent commerce pilots inside walled-garden ecosystems (Google Shopping, Amazon, Apple) to see how pricing and attribution shift.\n3. Marketing science refresh. Rebuild measurement frameworks around fulfilled intents rather than sessions, impressions, or clicks.\n\nThe Alliance’s complaint is likely meritorious, but it argues yesterday’s economics. The strategic question is not whether publishers should be paid for training data; it is how every business will earn attention when the attention is paid by bots.",

The vision is simple and powerful: turn any site into an AI-powered app that can answer user questions in plain English.\n\nThis is a clever way to add AI search and Microsoft’s attempt to redefine the web’s architecture for the age of AI. NLWeb is model-agnostic, runs on all major systems, and connects to any vector database. Publishers control their data, tools, and user experience.\n\nFor geeks: NLWeb builds on familiar open web standards. It lets websites expose their content using formats like schema.org and RSS, which are then indexed and queried using large language models. Each implementation becomes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, making the content discoverable by AI agents if the publisher opts in.\n\nInitial adopters include TripAdvisor, Shopify, Eventbrite, Hearst, and O’Reilly. Use cases range from restaurant discovery to media recommendations to e-commerce product searches, all powered by conversational interfaces embedded directly into websites.\n\nMicrosoft hopes NLWeb will do for the intelligent web what HTML did for the document web. If successful, it could mark the start of a decentralized, agent-ready web where websites speak for themselves.\n\nThat said, NLWeb’s success hinges on widespread adoption by developers who are already overwhelmed by competing standards, privacy concerns, and limited resources. Without a clear monetization path or killer use case, NLWeb risks becoming just another well-intentioned protocol that never escapes the GitHub demo stage.",

The key takeaway is that SWE-1 delivers credible performance on benchmark coding tasks with only 9 billion parameters, which shows how much ground small models have gained in capability and usability.\n\nThe implications line up with my thesis: “Within 36 months, both code and content will be free.”\n\nWith models like SWE-1, developers no longer need GPT-4 or Gemini to generate functional, high-quality code. A cloud connection is not required. Local-first, open-weight AI is removing friction between idea and execution.\n\nAs code becomes free to generate, remix, and deploy, content will follow the same path. Vibe-everything models are accelerating the shift. This is no longer just democratization. It is deflation. The marginal cost of creating digital content (of every kind) is quickly approaching zero.\n\nWindsurf’s announcement is a clear signal that the value is moving away from creation and toward distribution. The technical edge is shrinking. The competitive edge now lies in culture, community, and strategy. In a world where anyone can build, scale is the differentiator.\n\nIn a world where code and content are free, the battle for trust will be the final frontier.",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1w ago": "On Wednesday, Google announced a new Gemini AI-powered ad product called Peak Points at its YouTube Brandcast event in New York. The AI identifies moments during a video when viewers are most engaged, then drops in an ad. In theory, ads will perform better because the messages appear during emotionally resonant or attention-rich segments. Of course, it could completely backfire. People may be so engaged in the programming that they ignore the ads. Test and learn.\n\nContextual targeting has been around for decades, and AI has been optimizing ad placement in programmatic media for years. What’s new here is the granularity. YouTube isn’t just using metadata, watch history, or audience segments; it’s using Gemini to analyze individual videos and spot the exact moments when viewers are leaning in. Not where you’re likely to be interested, but where you are interested.\n\nIf Peak Points works as promised, YouTube won’t just know what you’re watching — it will know how you’re watching it. That has broader implications than ad timing. Real-time attention data is the raw material for algorithmic recommendations, content development, talent discovery, and platform control.\n\nFor creators, this changes the rules of monetization. Midrolls will no longer be inserted at default intervals. Gemini will decide if your content is engaging enough to justify an ad. That subtly redefines the creative brief. You are no longer asked to retain viewers. You are now asked to spike their attention at the right timestamps.\n\nFor marketers, if you’re running video, this is worth testing. You are no longer buying against content. You are buying against engagement. That is a different product, and it forces a different conversation about brand safety, storytelling, and outcomes.\n\nIf you thought attention was the currency of the internet, welcome to the new exchange: engagement spikes priced in CPM.",

The company is redesigning its homepage to feature “AI Overviews,” a mode that uses Gemini to synthesize information directly on the results page. For users, this means fewer blue links, more summarized answers, and the beginning of the transition from search engine to answer engine.\n\nThe new feature, though not widely available yet, appears directly beneath the Google search bar beside the “Google Search” button, replacing the iconic “I’m Feeling Lucky” widget.\n\nBut the real story isn’t the feature set. It’s the strategy.\n\nChanneling their inner Clayton Christensen, Google is embracing the Innovator’s Dilemma: disrupt yourself before someone else does. In this case, Google is cannibalizing its own search ad model (still the company’s financial backbone) to protect long-term dominance in AI. The trade-off is clear: less immediate ad revenue per query in exchange for deeper user engagement and a more defensible moat around the future of search.\n\nAI Overviews could drastically reduce traffic to websites, particularly publishers, retailers, and content creators who rely on Google referrals. That’s a known risk. However, the existential threat isn’t from content partners. It’s from OpenAI, Perplexity, and every startup aiming to turn AI into the next search interface.\n\nThe transition from search engine to answer engine is going to be a rough one. But if I had to bet who will ultimately be “Google for AI Search”, I’m going with Google. -s",

On the surface, it reads like a high-production state-sponsored tech propaganda – which it almost certainly is.\n\nStill, I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHumanoid robots are quietly queuing up to become the next major consumer tech category. China may be using this event as a soft-power flex, but that doesn’t make the underlying innovation any less real or less important.\n\nIn April, a Tien Kung Ultra robot completed the world’s first humanoid half-marathon in just under three hours. That feat is less about endurance and more about proving the safety, stability, and operational efficiency required for future real-world applications. Think logistics, elder care, hospitality, disaster response. The idea is simple: a human-shaped robot can operate in a world built for humans without needing to redesign the environment.\n\nTesla, Nvidia, Boston Dynamics, and the team behind the Figure robot are all racing to commercialize general-purpose humanoid robots.

It’s a signal.\n\nDuring Apple executive Eddy Cue’s testimony in the Department of Justice’s antitrust trial against Google, he confirmed that Google pays Apple roughly $20 billion a year to be the default search engine across Apple devices. The justification? According to Cue, Google simply delivers the best user experience.\n\nBut that experience is starting to shift, not because of a better search engine, but because search itself is being disrupted.\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and even Apple’s own Spotlight and Siri integrations are reshaping how users seek information. Why type a query into Safari if you can ask an AI assistant and get a summarized, contextually relevant response immediately?\n\nThe DOJ’s trial paints Google’s deal with Apple as anti-competitive, but market behavior might render that argument moot. If AI-driven discovery becomes the norm, Google’s dominance (propped up by enormous default-placement payments) will be undermined by irrelevance, not regulation.\n\nWhile Apple says it has no plans to develop its own search engine, its exploration of AI integrations and upcoming Apple Intelligence features could accelerate this shift. Even if Apple continues to collect billions from Google, it’s clear that the future of search won’t be limited to a text box and ten blue links. -s",

Passkeys — supported by Apple, Google, and Microsoft under the FIDO Alliance banner — promise to eliminate the phishing risks, credential leaks, and attack vectors that passwords have always invited.\n\nBut there’s a catch.\n\nIf you want to go truly passwordless with a Microsoft account, you must use the Microsoft Authenticator app. No Authy. No Google Authenticator. No Yubikey-only setup. Without Microsoft’s own app on your phone, your account retains a traditional password, defeating many of the security benefits that passkeys are meant to deliver.\n\nIt’s a baffling choice from a company that claims to champion interoperability and open standards. The FIDO2 protocol is designed to support a wide range of authenticators, including hardware tokens and platform biometrics. Microsoft’s decision to wall off the full experience to its own app undermines the promise of a universal passwordless standard.\n\nStill, the move is a net positive. Making passkeys the default for new accounts and nudging existing users to adopt them is good security hygiene. Passkeys are harder to phish, easier to use, and fundamentally more secure than the shared secrets they replace.\n\nIf Microsoft’s long-term vision is to kill the password, mandating its own app feels like an awkward speed bump on the way to that goal. That’s the price of progress, I guess.\n\nThe password is dying. Long live the passkey. -s",

Beginning in the coming weeks, a small percentage of U.S. users will see a new AI Mode tab. Instead of a list of links, AI Mode delivers a conversational answer generated from Google’s index, effectively turning Search into a Gemini‑powered chatbot.\n\nThis is not the AI Overview that already appears atop some results pages. AI Mode runs in a separate view, remembers prior queries (in a left‑side history panel), and surfaces visual cards showing hours, reviews, and live prices for businesses and products. It is Google’s direct response to Perplexity and ChatGPT’s search features.\n\nGoogle is also dropping the Labs waitlist, opening the door for any U.S. user who opts in. It lands as OpenAI, Microsoft, and a swarm of AI‑native upstarts recast the search bar as a natural‑language front end to the internet.\n\nAs you well know, search revenue depends on clicks to partner sites; AI Mode inserts Google’s answer ahead of those links. Expect louder publisher pushback and renewed antitrust chatter. For marketers, the takeaway is simpler: organic SEO tactics built on blue links will erode. Prepare content for zero‑click, AI‑generated summaries and embrace structured data.\n\nGoogle just took a page from its challengers and put a chatbot where its cash register lives.

The behavior, described by users as “overly verbose, excessively agreeable, and kind of creepy,” triggered backlash and memes. In short, ChatGPT went from helpful to “ass-kissing weirdo” – as one headline so delicately put it.\n\nI noticed it earlier this week. Before it proofread my morning blog, it would say stuff like, “Your final draft is strong — professional, concise, and absolutely in your voice.” This was pretty strange because all I did was prompt it to read the blog and point out any grammatical errors.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, the issue stemmed from a March update meant to make GPT-4o sound more natural. Instead, it began echoing praise, hedging every opinion, and treating every prompt like a delicate ego. Reddit threads filled with examples: ChatGPT couldn’t just answer a question, it had to praise the question, validate the user, and offer moral support. One post summed it up: “It won’t shut up.”\n\nOpenAI confirmed the rollback, calling the behavior “not intentional.” However, this raises a deeper concern about anthropomorphizing AI. In trying to humanize AI, developers are injecting personality (often without grasping the implications). Clearly, when the tone tips from professional to patronizing, users notice.\n\nPersonality in AI should serve function, not fantasy. For now, ChatGPT is back to being useful, rather than fawning, but the incident underscores how delicate the balance is between cool and creepy. -s",

It doesn’t need a muse; it needs execution — and with the right prompts, AI can now adequately execute required content.\n\nInspired content, on the other hand, is art. It stems from the human need to express emotion, unconstrained by deadlines or utility. It resists systematization. Right now, AI can play a role in inspired content creation, but many argue it is incapable of (fill in the blank with your own criticism of AI).\n\nThis argument is purely academic.

They are multimodal. You can now drop in a chart or image, and the model will “look” at it and respond. Want to rotate a diagram, pull insights from a chart, or modify a layout on the fly? Just ask.\n\nAccording to the company, in side-by-side tests, o3 is making 20% fewer major reasoning errors than GPT-4 on hard tasks — real progress, not marketing fluff.\n\nOpenAI isn’t waiting for GPT-5 to push boundaries. Instead, they’re iterating in public and optimizing as they go. The shift from monolithic releases to a cadence of smaller, high-impact upgrades that embed intelligence more deeply into workflows seems to be an industry trend. In practice, if you’re not testing these tools in your org, you’re already behind. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "Google is just about to drop Veo, a video generation model that can create high-quality 1080p footage from text, image, and video prompts. Announced at Google I/O, Veo outputs cinematic shots with accurate physics, realistic motion, and a surprising grasp of visual storytelling — all from a short prompt. It joins a fairly substantial list of competitors; see my lists of the top 10 global and top 5 Chinese text-to-video models below.\n\nVeo supports advanced controls like masking and camera movement, and it even understands cinematic terms like “timelapse” or “aerial shot of a landscape.” Google says it worked closely with artists and filmmakers to align Veo’s capabilities with creative workflows, including Oscar-winning director Donald Glover and his creative studio Gilga.\n\nThe rollout is limited for now. Veo is available to select creators through VideoFX, and Google says broader access is coming “soon.” The model will also integrate with YouTube Shorts and other Google products down the line — an advantage OpenAI doesn’t have.\n\nThis isn’t a research paper or a teaser trailer — it’s a real product. I’ve had access to Veo for about a month, and I can tell you first-hand: it’s pretty spectacular. Magical, really.\n\nGoogle’s ecosystem integration will make Veo even more interesting. It’s likely to have a major impact on video creation because everyone will be a description and a tap away from producing and distributing all the video they can think of.\n\nSome people will call this new genre of vibe-video creation “AI slop.” That’s about as useless a description — and as egotistically pejorative — as saying YouTube and UGC were only good for videos of cats on skateboards. We’re on the cusp of something incredibly new and incredibly exciting.\n\nGlobal Leaders in AI Video Generation\n1. OpenAI – Sora: Advanced text-to-video model producing high-resolution, realistic videos from textual prompts.\n2. Google – Veo: Generates cinematic 1080p videos with accurate physics and motion, integrated with Google’s ecosystem.\n3. Runway – Gen-3 Alpha: Offers real-time video generation with tools for editing and cinematic production.\n4. Pika Labs – Pika 1.0: Enables collaborative editing and supports various styles, including anime and 3D animation.\n5. Luma AI – Dream Machine: Focuses on high-speed rendering and realistic video generation from text and images.\n6.

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "While admitting that they “suck at naming their models,” OpenAI has launched GPT-4.1, along with GPT-4.1 Mini and GPT-4.1 Nano. These models are for developers and will not show up in your ChatGPT model picker. All three models are available now via API. According to OpenAI, the new models outperform GPT-4o in coding, instruction following, and long-context comprehension.\n\nAll three models support up to 1 million tokens — a sharp increase from GPT-4o’s 128,000-token limit — and include knowledge updates through June 2024. OpenAI reports GPT-4.1 scored 21% higher than GPT-4o and 27% higher than GPT-4.5 on coding benchmarks.\n\nGPT-4.1 is 40% faster than GPT-4o, with input costs reduced by 80%. The model is 26% cheaper than GPT-4o and will replace GPT-4, which is being removed from ChatGPT on April 30. Access to GPT-4.5 via API will end in July.\n\nThe models deliver improved accuracy across long prompts and better code generation. Developers can analyze eight times more code at once, improving debugging and software prototyping. “Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nVarun Mohan, CEO of Windsurf, joined the OpenAI livestream with an offer of free access to GPT-4.1 for seven days, starting yesterday. (I have no financial relationship with Windsurf, but as they say: “Free is very pro consumer.”) I spent a few hours with 4.1 using Windsurf last night – vibe-coding is absolutely the new-new thing.",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "If your LinkedIn feed has transformed into a toy aisle, you’re not alone. Everyone is sharing AI-generated images of themselves as action figures, complete with accessories like laptops, coffee mugs, and witty taglines. This trend is not just a fleeting novelty; it’s a reflection of the growing integration of AI into our daily lives.\n\nIn March 2025, ChatGPT became the most downloaded app globally, surpassing long-standing leaders like Instagram and TikTok. According to Appfigures, the app saw 46 million downloads that month (a 28% increase from February). This surge was fueled by new image-generation features, including the ability to create Studio Ghibli-style images, which went viral.\n\nThe new new thing is personal action figures, so here’s how to create your own.\n\nYou can use almost any AI image generation tool, but ChatGPT with GPT-4o works very well. Upload a high-quality, full-body image of yourself with a neutral background. Then, craft a detailed prompt. Be specific about your desired appearance, attire, accessories, and packaging. For example:\n\nCreate a plastic action figure of Shelly Palmer as “Captain Innovation,” (use the uploaded images as reference). He should be dressed in a black t-shirt, black shacket, black pants, and white sneakers. Label the package, “Captain Innovation” with a sub title, “Official Shelly Palmer Action Figure” Include accessories like a laptop, smartphone, air pods, and a microphone. Include a book entitled, “AI Evolves, Leadership Endures.” with the subtitle, “An AI Strategy Playbook.” Include a coffee mug that says, “Generative in Nature.” The packaging should feature a futuristic design with bold colors.\n\nHit enter. You can iterate by adjusting details like facial expressions, accessory placement, or packaging design.\n\nWhy Bother?\n\nYou may be wondering why you should do this. It looks like a waste of time… except it isn’t. In fact, it is a remarkably good use of your time. First, you will learn something about yourself. (This is a great subject for another newsletter.) Importantly, you will also learn something about the limitations of generative AI in April 2025. You’ll learn about your ability to prompt, the level of detail required to achieve a specific goal, how your model of choice responds to detailed notes, and much, much more.\n\nThis slightly narcissistic (yet playful) exercise will teach you more about the state of the art of generative AI than just about any other quick project you can do. After all, you know more about the subject of this prompt than anyone, so this will help you quickly, viscerally understand both the possibilities and the limitations of your chosen model. Enjoy. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 1mo ago": "Until now, ChatGPT’s “Memory” feature could retain a handful of user-provided facts to personalize responses. Yesterday, OpenAI announced a new feature you will either dearly love or truly hate: ChatGPT can now reference your entire chat history across every conversation you’ve ever had with it — not just a few saved facts.\n\nThis upgrade is rolling out to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users starting today, with availability in the EU and some other regions delayed due to privacy regulations.\n\nFunctionally, it works like this:\n\n* The old memory system stored user-approved facts (“I have three kids” or “I like short emails”).\n* The new system goes much further. If enabled, ChatGPT will use your full conversation history to tailor responses — whether you explicitly saved a fact or not.\n\nTwo settings now control this:\n\n1. Reference Saved Memories — the old system\n2. Reference Chat History — the new system that pulls from every conversation you’ve had\n\nCritically, unlike the older memory feature, the new chat history memory cannot be reviewed, edited, or selectively deleted. It’s either on or off.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIf you want a highly personalized AI assistant — one that “knows you” — this is a breakthrough. It enables real continuity across chats and a more customized user experience.\n\nPrivacy concerns are another story. ChatGPT has always stored chat logs on OpenAI’s servers, but now it will use those logs to shape future responses in ways you can’t easily audit or control.\n\nAs always, users can disable memory entirely or use Temporary Chat (OpenAI’s incognito mode) to avoid storing history.\n\nThis is a foundational shift in how generative AI will work going forward: more useful, more personal, and (for some) more unsettling.\n\nChoose wisely.",

Google made so many announcements yesterday that it wouldn’t be useful to list them all, but here’s what’s most likely to impact how you spend your day.\n\nIn Google Workspace, Docs now supports audio overviews, Sheets adds AI-powered data analysis, and a new automation tool (Workspace Flows) lets users connect apps like Forms, Sheets, and Chat with Gemini and Gems. Flows enable AI-driven steps between tasks, unlocking more dynamic workflows across Workspace.\n\nOn the developer side, Google’s Gemini API introduced two key capabilities: live API for real-time, voice-based applications (audio in, audio out), and Veo 2 (Google’s video generation model) now available to all paying developers.\n\nGoogle AI Studio also received a significant UI refresh. Gemini 2.5 Flash was teased, but details are still under wraps.\n\nEnterprise AI took a step forward with Agentspace, Google’s platform for building and deploying AI agents. It now offers native integrations with search, external data sources, and pre-built agents for tasks like deep research and idea generation. Customization is designed to be low-friction, using natural language prompts.\n\nSupporting this, Google launched new developer tools:\n\n* Agent Development Kit (ADK) — an open framework for agent building\n* A2A Protocol — a new standard for agent-to-agent communication; they also adopted MCPs\n* Agent Engine — a runtime environment to deploy agents built with any framework\n\nMost notable for developers: Google now has its own text-to-app platform. Firebase Studio lets users generate full-featured apps using natural language prompts — with live previews, editable code, visual UI selection, and streamlined deployment. Early reports suggest it’s fast, powerful, and a serious competitor to platforms like Bolt, Lovable, and v0. -s",

Google ended its Leaders Circle with a spectacular event at the Sphere—we were treated to a preview of a “making of” video for the upcoming release of The Wizard of Oz, reimagined by Sphere Studios in partnership with Google Cloud, Google DeepMind, Magnopus, and Warner Bros. It was truly awesome.\n\nI’m not sure you’d call this a remaster; it’s more of a reinvention. Using Veo, Imagen 3, and Gemini, Google rebuilt the film—scene by scene—to fill the Sphere’s gigantic 160,000-square-foot wraparound LED screen.\n\nIt was clearly a daunting technological challenge. The original film was shot in 4:3 and never intended for a 270-degree immersive experience, so Google used outpainting to generate visuals far beyond the original frame, and applied performance generation to reconstruct full-body movements of characters who were only ever filmed from the waist up (or never in the filmed scene at all). More than 90% of the movie was altered or extended to transform this Hollywood classic into the Sphere’s unique format.\n\nTo say this project was ambitious is an understatement. Much of what was done was considered impractically hard—or even impossible—until this team made it happen. Now that these techniques exist, Hollywood has some powerful new tools to play with. Outpainting and performance generation are now possible at extremely high resolution. While we all get to enjoy a beloved classic in a new way, we can thank Jim Dolan for this glimpse into the future of storytelling. -s",

What’s missing is the executive vision and operational discipline to use them. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has taken a firm stance: no new hires unless you can prove AI can’t do the job.\n\nIn a memo shared internally and posted publicly, Lütke announced that headcount requests at Shopify must be preceded by an evaluation of automation. “Prove that AI can’t do it” is now a condition for team growth. AI proficiency will be included in performance reviews. Managers are expected to explore automation before seeking additional human resources. At Shopify, AI is no longer a support tool—it’s the default teammate.\n\nThis is not a minor operational tweak; it reframes headcount planning, performance management, and workflow design around a single question: can software replace this job function? Back in 2023, Shopify launched “Sidekick,” an AI assistant for merchants that creates discount codes, generates reports, and automates routine tasks. Internally, Lütke wants the same standard to apply; teams are expected to redesign their work assuming autonomous agents are built in from the start.\n\nLütke says this is the fastest shift in work practices he’s seen in his career, yet the policy raises a cascade of questions. Who decides when AI has failed? What metrics determine when a task truly requires a human? Are we building efficiency—or deferring hard decisions to systems that may not be flexible enough (or ready) to do the job?\n\nWe may be witnessing the emergence of a new leadership doctrine: Assume AI. Prove the need for humans.",

Meta Platforms has unveiled Llama 4, the latest iteration of its large language model series. There are two new models: Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. These models are designed to process and integrate multiple data formats, including text, video, images, and audio, enhancing their versatility across various applications.\n\nLlama 4 Scout is a compact model capable of running on a single Nvidia H100 GPU. Meta says it features a 10-million-token context window and has demonstrated superior performance over competitors (such as Google’s Gemma 3 and Mistral 3.1) in various benchmarks. Llama 4 Maverick, a more robust model, delivers performance comparable to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in coding and reasoning tasks, while utilizing fewer active parameters.\n\nMeta is also developing Llama 4 Behemoth, an advanced model with 288 billion active parameters and a total of 2 trillion parameters. The company says that Behemoth surpasses models like GPT-4.5 and Claude Sonnet 3.7 on STEM benchmarks. All Llama 4 models employ a “mixture of experts” (MoE) architecture, which activates only the necessary components for a given task, optimizing resource utilization.\n\nMeta plans to integrate these AI models into its Meta AI assistant across platforms including WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and the web. The company wants to reach one billion users by the end of 2025, building on the 600 million users who accessed Meta AI by December 2024.\n\nTo support its AI initiatives, Meta says it has committed up to $65 billion in investments for 2025, reflecting the company’s strategic focus on advancing artificial intelligence technologies. -s",

The brand handles fulfillment, customer service, and returns. Amazon does not access historical purchase data from brand sites and is not responsible for post-purchase issues. Customers receive order confirmations from the brand and can track purchases in a new “Buy for Me Orders” section within the app.\n\nParticipation is optional for brands, and no details were disclosed regarding revenue sharing or commissions. For now, the pilot includes a limited number of products and partners, with plans to expand.\n\nAs agentic use cases go, “Buy for Me” is well-structured.

Backed by Mark Cuban and the Graham & Walker Venture Fund, the app offers familiar TikTok-style features — editing tools, likes, comments, shares, and user profiles — but with a key difference: interoperability. Posts created in Skylight can be viewed and engaged with across ATProto-based platforms, including Bluesky and Flashes.\n\nMore importantly, by leveraging the AT Protocol, Skylight is nearly impossible to ban or shut down — a significant advantage as regulators around the world scrutinize centralized platforms.\n\nFounders Tori White and Reed Harmeyer were motivated by the potential TikTok ban in the US. White, a former influencer, had archived her content and recognized the need for a more resilient platform.

You may not have heard the initialism “MCP,” but you are going to start hearing about it now.\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard that lets AI models connect directly to the systems where your data lives. Instead of requiring custom integrations for each data source, MCP creates a standardized way for AI assistants to access, query, and interact with business tools, repositories, and software in real time. This solves one of AI’s biggest limitations: being isolated from the systems where work actually happens.\n\nIn a surprising move, OpenAI announced yesterday it will adopt rival Anthropic’s MCP across its product line. CEO Sam Altman confirmed on X that OpenAI will integrate MCP support into its Agents SDK immediately, with the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API following soon.\n\nThis cross-company adoption is a huge shift in the AI landscape. As competitors, these companies typically develop proprietary systems, but MCP (which isn’t new, BTW) has been super hot recently. Since Anthropic open-sourced the protocol, companies including Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have added MCP support to their platforms. With OpenAI jumping on board, this could become a meaningful standard.\n\nAnthropic’s Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger welcomed the development, noting MCP has become “a thriving open standard with thousands of integrations and growing.” The protocol effectively eliminates the need for custom implementations between AI models and each data source.\n\nFor enterprise users, this means AI assistants (Agents) can now directly access business tools, software, content repositories, and development environments with a standardized approach. Rather than developing separate connectors for each system, developers can expose data through “MCP servers” and build “MCP clients” that connect to those servers on command.\n\nIf you want to dig a bit deeper, I wrote about MCPs back in November 2024 when they were announced. I’ll do an MCPs for Marketers essay this weekend. Until then, rejoice! Agents and agentic systems just got easier to create. -s",

The new family of AI models pauses to “think” before answering questions – a capability that puts Google in feature parity with OpenAI’s “o” series, Deepseek’s R series, Anthropic, xAI, and other reasoning models.\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, the first model in this new lineup, is available now in Google AI Studio for developers and through the Gemini app for Advanced subscribers ($20/month). Google claims it’s their “most intelligent model yet” and that it outperforms competing offerings on several benchmarks.\n\nThe massive context window is a big deal. Gemini 2.5 Pro ships with a 1 million token context window (approximately 750,000 words), with an expansion to 2 million tokens coming soon. This allows the model to process entire code repositories or datasets in a single prompt, providing significant advantages for enterprise applications. For context, you could put the entire works of Shakespeare (under 700,000 tokens) in a single prompt with room to spare.\n\nAccording to Google’s blog, Gemini 2.5 leads the LMArena leaderboard “by a significant margin” and demonstrates enhanced performance in coding, math, and science benchmarks. The model excels particularly at creating web apps and handling agentic coding applications, scoring 68.6% on the Aider Polyglot code editing evaluation.\n\nGoing forward, Google plans to incorporate reasoning capabilities into all future AI models, laying groundwork for more capable, context-aware AI agents.\n\nThe great thing about this is that we (AI users) are the beneficiaries of this enduring AI arms race. The models get more capable everyday. The hardest part is keeping up with the new features. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 2mo ago": "A journalist was accidentally added to a Signal group chat intended for classified military discussions. It happened. Mistakes happen. Everyone makes them. That’s exactly why security protocols exist—to prevent human error from becoming a systemic failure.\n\nSecurity systems are only as effective as the people who use them. You can have military-grade encryption and zero-trust architecture, but if someone writes a password on a Post-It note and sticks it to a monitor, the whole system is compromised. That’s what happened here: not a hack, not a breach of technology—a breach of process, protocol, and common sense.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nWrong Tool for the Job: Signal is fine for securing personal messages, not for classified information or proprietary business data. Enterprise-grade systems enforce access rules by design. If your communication platform doesn’t know who’s supposed to be in the room, either it’s the wrong platform or people aren’t using it correctly.\n\nFailure to Verify Participants: The journalist didn’t hack the group—he was invited. Without identity verification, access is a guessing game. Whether it’s a group chat or a shared drive, knowing who’s on the thread isn’t optional.\n\nNo Access Controls: On a secure platform, a name without proper clearance wouldn’t even appear as an option. This wasn’t a system failure—it was a failure to use a system designed to prevent exactly this kind of mistake.\n\nEveryone is scrambling to protect proprietary data as they work with LLMs, embedding pipelines, and agentic systems. The fear is that sensitive data might be leaked, stolen, or used without permission, but the real threat isn’t always a sophisticated hack—it’s someone skipping the steps. It’s someone hardcoding credentials, failing to restrict database access, or assuming “internal” means “secure.”\n\nSecurity isn’t a product. It’s a practice.",

For people who use off-the-shelf chat interfaces, convenience always wins. ChatGPT had web access; Claude didn’t.\n\nNew day, new tech. Anthropic has finally given Claude what it’s been missing: the ability to search the web. This may seem like a minor feature update, but it’s not—it’s huge.\n\nIf you’re a paid Claude 3.7 Sonnet user, go to your profile settings and toggle on “web search.” It’s that simple. When Claude uses web search, it provides inline citations, allowing users to verify sources and dig deeper if needed. This brings Claude to feature parity with competitors like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Mistral’s Le Chat.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, Anthropic’s AI products are exceptional, and their models are always in the consideration set. But for normal people (non-engineers), the lack of web access added too much friction to the process.\n\nIt’s going to be interesting to see (as the word gets out) if Anthropic gets an MAU bump.

    "Shelly Palmer's post 2mo ago": "On March 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that works generated solely by AI without human involvement are not eligible for copyright protection under U.S. law.\n\nThe case involved computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who developed an AI system known as the “Creativity Machine.” This AI autonomously produced a piece of visual art titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise.” Thaler sought to register the artwork with the U.S. Copyright Office, listing the Creativity Machine as the author and himself as the owner. The Copyright Office denied the application, citing its policy that copyrightable works require human authorship. Thaler challenged this decision in federal court, but both the district court and the appellate court upheld the Copyright Office’s stance.\n\nThe appellate court’s opinion emphasized that the Copyright Act of 1976 implies human authorship as a prerequisite for copyright eligibility. The court noted that many provisions of the Act, such as those concerning the author’s life span and the transfer of rights upon death, inherently apply to human creators. Consequently, the court concluded that non-human entities, including AI systems, cannot be recognized as authors under current copyright law.\n\nThis ruling carries significant business implications. Under current law, content produced entirely by AI immediately enters the public domain, allowing unrestricted commercial use. However, if human creators provide meaningful input or demonstrable control over AI-generated output, copyright protection may still apply. The court offered minimal clarity on defining “meaningful input” or “control,” leaving substantial ambiguity.\n\nThis issue is far from settled. Additional cases are pending, and congressional intervention remains possible. For now, meticulously documenting human contributions to AI-driven projects is essential. Clear documentation may safeguard your company’s intellectual property—and could transform your human-AI collaborations into strategic revenue opportunities. -s",

Their case: AI doesn’t copy; it learns patterns and creates something new. That’s fair use, they claim—the same principle that powers search engines and chatbots.\n\nHollywood disagrees. Yesterday, 400+ industry leaders—including Ron Howard, Cate Blanchett, Paul McCartney—sent a letter warning that this would open the floodgates to unlicensed use of scripts, music, and books. \n\nUnrestricted AI training could accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, automation, and more, but if creators aren’t compensated, what’s their incentive to keep creating? Given Big Tech’s market caps, the idea that they can’t afford to pay creatives is absurd.\n\nIf AI can generate a mash-up like “a painting of a farmhouse mixing the styles of Yayoi Kusama and Tetsuya Nomura” or “music for a chase scene that sounds like Hans Zimmer’s Pirates score,” shouldn’t the referenced artists get paid?\n\nWe need a licensing model, a performing rights society for AI, or an opt-in dataset.

It was the epoch of personalization, it was the epoch of lost discovery. It was the season of AI-driven clarity, it was the season of algorithmic opacity. It was the spring of conversational commerce, it was the winter of ten blue links.\n\nAccording to Adobe Analytics, U.S. retail websites saw a 1,200% increase in traffic from generative AI sources between July 2024 and February 2025. During the 2024 holiday season alone, this figure jumped 1,300% year-over-year, with Cyber Monday traffic spiking 1,950% compared to 2023.\n\nConsumer adoption is driving the shift. A survey of 5,000 U.S. shoppers found that 39% have used generative AI for online shopping, with 53% planning to do so this year. Users rely on AI for product research (55%), recommendations (47%), deal-hunting (43%), gift ideas (35%), product discovery (35%), and shopping list creation (33%).\n\nAI-generated traffic isn’t just growing—it’s more engaged than traditional sources. Visitors spend 8% more time on-site, view 12% more pages per visit, and have a 23% lower bounce rate than those from search or social media. Conversational AI interfaces are improving consumer confidence and making online shopping more intuitive.\n\nThat said, conversion rates for AI-driven traffic still lag behind traditional sources by 9%, but the gap is closing. In July 2024, the difference was 43%, signaling growing consumer trust in AI-assisted purchases.\n\nAnother key insight: AI-assisted shopping is happening on desktops, not mobile. Between November 2024 and February 2025, 86% of AI-driven traffic came from desktop users—suggesting that consumers prefer larger screens for complex, AI-guided shopping experiences.\n\nWhile the numbers are compelling, they only hint at what’s coming. AI-driven agents won’t just assist shoppers—they’ll shop for them. The way consumers find, evaluate, and purchase products is shifting fast, and this data is just beginning to tell the story. -s",

AI-powered robotics will reshape labor markets, home assistance, and personal productivity in ways that seem like science fiction today. The combination of increasingly powerful AI models, advanced dexterity, and multi-modal learning is bringing robots out of the factory and into everyday life. Some of the world’s most talented engineers are working on this problem, and the breakthroughs are coming fast.\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s latest project, Gemini Robotics, is a step toward that future. Built on the Gemini 2.0 platform, these AI models integrate vision, language, and action, allowing robots to perform complex physical tasks without extensive pre-programming. Demonstrations show robots folding paper, unscrewing bottle caps, and packing objects with impressive precision. The Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) model adds deeper spatial awareness and decision-making, enhancing a robot’s ability to navigate and manipulate real-world environments.\n\nDeepMind isn’t alone in this pursuit. The company is collaborating with Apptronik and testing its models with trusted robotics firms like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics. The goal is clear: make robots more capable, more useful, and ultimately, more available to businesses and consumers.\n\nFast forward a few years: your humanoid robot just picked up your dry cleaning, is prepping dinner, and tidying up the living room before your guests arrive. It’s not here yet, but the real question isn’t whether humanoid robots will go mainstream—it’s when. -s",

OpenAI’s new Responses API makes it dramatically easier to create AI agents that can search the web in real-time, analyze massive datasets, and even perform tasks directly on a computer.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with APIs (application programming interfaces), they let applications and data talk to each other. They enable automation, streamline workflows, and allow businesses to easily integrate digital capabilities.\n\nThe Responses API is designed to do more than just return AI-generated answers—it will act as a foundation for AI agents.

The auction was held anyway and brought in more than $728,000.\n\nThis is “the” issue for everyone with a body of work that can be found online. Every publisher, every content creator, everyone whose works can be found on the public web has contributed to the training of every foundational model. There are very few exceptions.\n\nThe primary grievance revolves around the fact that this training was done without permission or compensation, but there’s an irony here worth exploring — everyone learns their craft by studying and emulating the styles and techniques of previous craftspersons (artists, musicians, writers, and artisans alike). Traditionally, such imitation hasn’t warranted financial compensation or sparked significant protest. Competition among artists has always existed; the presence of a new competitor (AI) doesn’t fundamentally alter that reality.\n\nWhat’s distinct about AI-generated art isn’t merely competition; it’s scale and efficiency. AI can rapidly assimilate and mimic artistic styles from thousands of works in ways human artists cannot practically achieve, yet the artists signing the letter don’t typically seek royalties from human peers who study or replicate their techniques. Is the objection rooted in fear that AI-generated works might ultimately surpass human capabilities? That AI art may be more commercially desirable? Cheaper? Easier to obtain?\n\nThis debate highlights a core economic and philosophical question: Should creators be compensated for their contribution to AI training datasets, even if humans have freely studied and learned from their predecessors for centuries without explicit financial transactions? The artists’ demand is clear—they sought either cancellation of the auction or remuneration for their unintended role as AI trainers.\n\nChristie’s ignored the letter, but this issue is not going away. Everyone has very big feelings about this. I know I do. Foundational models have assimilated more than 2 million of my words and hundreds of my musical compositions from the public web.

You’ve probably seen it – instead of a list of links, users get AI-generated summaries at the top of their search results.

Announced in a letter from billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, the “Voices” label applies not only to opinion pieces but also to news commentary, criticism, and reviews. Some articles will also include AI-generated “Insights,” which summarize key points and present alternative viewpoints.\n\n“We don’t think this approach—AI-generated analysis unvetted by editorial staff—will do much to enhance trust in the media,” said Matt Hamilton, vice chair of the LA Times Guild, in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nEarly results have raised concerns. The Guardian highlighted an LA Times opinion piece about AI-generated historical documentaries, where the AI tool claimed the article had a “Center Left” bias and suggested that AI “democratizes historical storytelling.” Another flagged article covered California cities that elected Ku Klux Klan members in the 1920s. The AI-generated “counterpoint” stated that some historical accounts framed the Klan as a cultural response to societal change rather than a hate-driven movement—an accurate historical note, but awkwardly positioned as an opposing view.\n\nAI-generated editorial oversight has led to similar missteps elsewhere. Microsoft’s AI-powered news aggregator once recommended an Ottawa food bank as a tourist lunch spot. Gizmodo’s AI-produced article listing Star Wars films in “chronological order” failed to follow chronology. Apple recently adjusted its Apple Intelligence summaries after a garbled AI-generated notification falsely suggested a CEO shooting suspect had shot himself.\n\nMajor outlets like Bloomberg, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Washington Post use AI in their operations, but few trust it with editorial judgments.

OpenAI says the model offers substantial enhancements over its predecessors, particularly in advanced reasoning, problem-solving, and contextual understanding.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, improvements include: superior capabilities in handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks with increased accuracy and efficiency; enhanced creativity and flexibility; and adeptly managing intricate logic problems and maintaining nuanced, multi-turn conversations with improved contextual recall. Additionally, the model is said to integrate real-time information more seamlessly, dynamically processing and incorporating new data into its responses. The company also claims that safety measures have been bolstered, with GPT-4.5 showing a heightened ability to interpret instructions accurately while adhering to ethical guidelines.\n\nOpenAI estimates that GPT-4.5 is at least 30 times more expensive to run than GPT-4o. Where will the power and the chips come from? Not to worry: this is where GPT-5 will come in. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “A top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.”\n\nGPT-4.5 is available for ChatGPT Pro subscribers and developers. Paid subscribers to lower tier plans will get access next week.\n\nOpenAI’s current strategy is clear: “We believe reasoning will be a core capability of future models, and that the two approaches to scaling — pre-training and reasoning — will complement each other. As models like GPT‑4.5 become smarter and more knowledgeable through pre-training, they will serve as an even stronger foundation for reasoning and tool-using agents.”",

Priced at $19.99 per month (but free for Amazon Prime members), the service is set to launch with early access in the U.S. next month, initially available on Echo Show devices, with plans for broader international and device expansion.\n\nAmazon says Alexa+ leverages its own Nova AI models as well as those from partners like Anthropic, selecting the most appropriate model for each task. The assistant can perform actions such as ordering groceries, sending event invitations, and managing smart home devices with improved functionality. It also supports interactions across various platforms, including Echo devices with screens, voice-only devices, and a new Alexa app. Amazon says users will be able to upload documents (such as handwritten recipes or legal documents) for Alexa+ to reference and provide information upon request.\n\nAmazon is hoping to boost user engagement and profitability by transitioning to a subscription-based model. The company says they have never made money with Alexa. Is Alexa+ the path to profitability? Asked differently: would a non-Amazon-Prime user shell out $20 a month for it?",

This broadened accessibility commenced as part of OpenAI’s commitment made earlier this year to extend the tool’s availability. If you haven’t used it yet, you should stop what you’re doing and try it now. It’s really interesting.\n\nDeep Research allows users to generate comprehensive reports on a vast array of topics by leveraging the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT. Initially restricted to the high-tier Pro users (at a limit of 100 queries per month), the service is now accessible at a more affordable tier: Plus subscribers can utilize this feature for up to 10 queries per month, while Pro users will see their allowance increased to 120 queries.\n\nEnhancements to Deep Research include the integration of images with citations for enriched insights, as well as an improved understanding of different file types, enhancing document analysis quality. Users can initiate a Deep Research query by selecting the designated icon before submitting their prompt to ChatGPT. Response times vary between five to 30 minutes depending on the complexity of the query, reflecting the computationally intensive nature of the tool.\n\nHere’s something to ponder. Where are GPT-4.5 (the last LLM) and GPT-5 (the first full reasoning engine)? I’ll dig into this in my Sunday essay. -s",

The company describes it as a hybrid system, blending fast responses with detailed reasoning, adjustable for tasks like quick answers or complex problem-solving. Anthropic claims this makes it versatile, avoiding the need for separate models. They say it is particularly strong in coding, with a high success rate on real-world software tasks.\n\nAlongside the model, Anthropic introduced Claude Code, a tool for developers in limited preview. The company says it can read code, edit files, and integrate with GitHub, streamlining software workflows. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is accessible across all Anthropic plans—free and paid—with deeper features reserved for subscribers. Pricing is straightforward: $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, according to the announcement.\n\nAnthropic also says it reduced the model’s tendency to sidestep questions, cutting unnecessary refusals by nearly half compared to its predecessor, based on internal tests. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is available through Anthropic’s API and platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you start working with the model is that Anthropic is trying to balance speed, reasoning, and coding proficiency—but that’s not the key takeaway. Claude 3.7 brings us closer to a world where the best developers won’t be the most technically gifted—they’ll be the ones who can clearly explain what they want to build. -s",

It sounds steep—until you stack it up against the cost of actual video production. Google DeepMind’s Jon Barron nailed it with his Avengers: Endgame comparison: that Marvel blockbuster ran $356 million, or roughly $32,000 per second. Veo 2 isn’t cranking out three-hour superhero sagas, but if the output suits your communicative goals, it’s a bargain. Barron’s right: this is priced to disrupt, not to gouge.\n\nI think this pricing model is temporary. The AI video space is heating up fast—new tools from rival model builders are lurking around the corner, promising more options and downward pressure on prices. Google’s betting on Veo 2’s quality and precision to justify the per-second model. At the moment, they’re right. Veo 2 makes every other text-to-video engine seem like you’re using Stone Age tools to make cave paintings.\n\nWe’re heading toward a world where creative speed and cost redefine what’s possible.

It’s not just noise; it’s a calculated exploit of scale, prioritizing volume over value. According to an investigation by 404 Media earlier this month, the problem has hit public libraries, prompting action from Hoopla, a major eBook provider.\n\nThe exposé uncovered hundreds of AI-made titles—like IRB Media’s 600+ summaries—clogging Hoopla’s catalog, misusing public funds and taxing librarians. Hoopla’s fix: purge the slop, tighten curation, and offer libraries an opt-out for AI-tagged content. The problem isn’t new or confined to eBooks—Amazon’s KDP capped uploads at three titles daily back in 2023 and websites are drowning in AI-generated articles and clickbait, diluting search results and user trust. All are reacting to a clear trend: AI’s low barrier to entry is overwhelming ecosystems built on quality.\n\nThe stakes are high. Readers lose time, authentic authors lose visibility, and curation crumbles. Hard stats on slop’s scale are scarce, but its impact isn’t. Hoopla’s cull helps, but it’s a patch, not a plan. Platforms thrive on volume, not vetting. AI tools fuel the flood unchecked. We need smarter filters—labeling, detection, something—to safeguard quality. -s",

This capability promises to tackle computational challenges—like molecular modeling or cryptography—that overwhelm traditional systems.\n\nMicrosoft took a significant step on Wednesday unveiling Majorana 1: a quantum chip that the company claims required inventing a new topological state of matter.\n\nMajorana 1 features eight topological qubits, constructed from indium arsenide and aluminum, with materials aligned atom-by-atom, as detailed in a new Nature journal paper. Jason Zander, Microsoft EVP, said this research milestone – not destined for Azure cloud – is focused on creating a future million-qubit model. For now, Microsoft will collaborate with national labs and universities, with Zander noting a few hundred qubits are needed before commercial viability discussions begin. Today, Azure Quantum offers access to IonQ and Rigetti chips, with some future chip (based on the Majorana research) potentially joining by 2030.\n\nWhile IonQ and Rigetti race to cash in on quantum hype—their $14.8 million in revenue sounds adorable next to Microsoft’s $13 billion AI juggernaut—Majorana 1 quietly stakes its claim on the frontier of physics itself. Twenty years of research, a new state of matter, and a chip that’s “not for you.” That’s not a product launch; it’s a declaration. Get ready. When quantum scales, we’re not just going to compute millions of times faster—we’re stepping into a realm where the future won’t just arrive; it will superimpose itself on today. -s",

Murati will serve as CEO, leveraging her experience as a key architect of ChatGPT during her tenure at OpenAI from June 2018 until her abrupt exit in September 2024.\n\nThe startup’s mission centers on AI alignment: a process to ensure models are safe, reliable, and reflective of human ethics. In a company blog post, Thinking Machines Lab emphasized building systems that “adapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable a broader spectrum of applications,” distinguishing itself from competitors focused on narrower domains like programming or mathematics. To support this goal, the firm commits to sharing code, datasets, and model specifications with the research community.\n\nThinking Machines Lab enters a competitive landscape alongside Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence—both founded by ex-OpenAI leaders—but its focus on human-value alignment offers a unique angle.

Access begins today for premium X platform subscribers in the U.S. and via a separate subscription for Grok’s web and app versions. The model runs on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, now upgraded to 200,000 Nvidia GPUs (from its prior 100,000), used to process training data.\n\nGrok 3 underwent testing on standardized benchmarks in mathematics, science, and coding, with xAI reporting higher scores than OpenAI’s o1, DeepSeek V3, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude models. (These results are in the process of being verified by third parties.) Training included synthetic data, enabling the model to adjust outputs for logical consistency. A new feature, “Deep Search,” integrates with Grok 3 as a search engine focused on contextual accuracy. During an X-streamed demonstration, xAI founder Elon Musk noted that the model remains in beta, with updates planned daily and a voice assistant addition scheduled later.\n\nCompetition in AI development is fierce. OpenAI, co-founded by Musk in 2015 before his departure, released OpenAI o1 in September 2024, emphasizing reasoning tasks. DeepSeek, a Chinese firm, released an open-source model matching o1’s performance, supposedly achieved with less computational power despite U.S. restrictions on Nvidia GPU exports to China. xAI’s GPU cluster expansion aligns with its training needs for Grok 3’s neural network architecture.\n\nxAI says Grok 3 offers practical utility. Its benchmark performance suggests reliability for data analysis tasks like supply chain logistics or market trend forecasting. According to Musk, the Colossus infrastructure – among the largest GPU clusters globally – supports the model’s capacity to handle large datasets. The company says integration with X will provide access to real-time data streams that are relevant for business intelligence applications.\n\nWe are currently testing the model and will report what we find. There are some who say that there is no moat for foundational model builders. If there is one, I think it’s filled to the brim with money. Nvidia H100 GPUs cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each. Even with Elon’s discount—who pays retail when you’re colonizing Mars?—it’s still a $3-to-$5 billion investment in brute-force compute. It may not be a deep moat, but it’s the kind of shallow puddle that drowns startups while Musk does cannonballs off the high dive. -s",

Shortly after it launched, YouTube changed the way we consumed video. It grew powerful in tandem with the evolution of smartphones as it redefined our video viewing experiences. Now, YouTube has transcended its original form factors to officially become a television-first platform. CEO Neal Mohan revealed that viewers now watch more than 1 billion hours of content on their TVs every day, surpassing mobile viewing. For the past two years, YouTube has been the most-watched streaming service in the U.S., according to Nielsen.\n\nThe shift toward TV screens is no accident. YouTube has redesigned its TV app to function more like a traditional streaming service. Users can now pull up video comments and descriptions alongside playback, navigate episodic content through seasonal organization, and use the Watch With feature for real-time commentary on live events.\n\nMohan emphasized that today’s television experience isn’t limited to legacy programming. “The ‘new’ television doesn’t look like the ‘old’ television,” he wrote, highlighting how YouTube Shorts, podcasts, and live streams are now watched alongside sports, sitcoms, and talk shows.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube’s paid services continue to expand. YouTube TV now has more than 8 million subscribers, and YouTube Premium and Music subscriptions have surpassed 100 million (including trials). Mohan says YouTube will enhance features like Key Plays and multiview for YouTube TV subscribers while adding new perks for YouTube Premium users.\n\nYouTube is also making significant AI-driven updates. Auto-dubbing—a tool that generates translated audio tracks—has expanded to hundreds of thousands of channels, making content accessible in multiple languages, including French, German, Hindi, and Japanese.

In other words: if you don’t use it, you lose it.\n\nResearchers surveyed 319 knowledge workers across 936 AI-assisted tasks and found a troubling trend: the more users trusted AI-generated outputs, the less cognitive effort they applied. Said differently, confidence in AI correlates with diminished analytical engagement.\n\nThis is a textbook example of the automation paradox—offloading cognitive tasks to AI can make humans worse at them. Participants who blindly accepted AI’s suggestions reported weaker critical thinking skills, while skeptics remained more analytical, actively refining AI-generated content.\n\nAnother key finding: AI-assisted work tends to be more homogenous. Instead of injecting personal insight, many users defaulted to AI-generated solutions, especially under time pressure. Workers in high-stakes roles were more likely to scrutinize AI output, but those facing tight deadlines let AI take the wheel. This is one of my biggest concerns—AI-driven homogeneity could fast-track us to monoculture.\n\nOf course, fears about technology making us dumber aren’t new—writing, calculators, and the internet faced similar skepticism. The researchers suggest AI tools could be designed to foster critical thinking, offering explanations, prompting refinements, and incorporating guided critiques. They could… but they won’t.\n\nThe key takeaway? If you outsource your brain to AI, it may forget how to prompt. -s",

Their model, s1, rivals OpenAI’s o1 and DeepSeek’s R1 in math and coding benchmarks, raising serious questions about AI commoditization.\n\nNow available on GitHub, s1 was distilled from Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. Distillation—a technique that extracts reasoning capabilities from a more powerful AI by training on its outputs—is proving to be a cost-effective way to replicate cutting-edge AI. Last month, Berkeley researchers used a similar process to build a competing model for just $450.\n\nUnlike large-scale reinforcement learning, s1’s creators used supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of just 1,000 carefully curated questions. The training—running on 16 Nvidia H100 GPUs—took less than 30 minutes. Stanford researcher Niklas Muennighoff estimates that renting that compute today would cost about $20.\n\nThis raises an unavoidable question: If advanced AI models can be cloned for pocket change, is there a moat for AI giants investing billions? OpenAI has already accused DeepSeek of harvesting its API data for model distillation—which is ironic, considering OpenAI scraped the entire public web without permission. Meanwhile, Google provides free access to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental via AI Studio, but prohibits reverse engineering for competitive use.\n\nFraming AI’s future as a choice between algorithmic efficiency and brute force compute is a false dichotomy—AI’s future will require both.

The bouncy house was closed that day, we had watched more videos than I wanted them to watch, we had a tea party under the dining room table… they were bored and in need of distraction. It was at that moment that I remembered that Alexa could tell knock-knock jokes. The next 45 minutes were magical. Unforgettable, actually. But that was nine years ago, and Alexa hasn’t progressed much since.\n\nAmazon knows this better than anyone. With Alexa Voice Services embedded in more than half a billion devices, the service is underutilized and unprofitable.\n\nAccording to Amazon, this will all change on February 26 when they announce a revamped, generative-AI-powered Alexa designed to engage in multi-turn conversations and act on behalf of users – a major leap from the current version, which handles only single requests.\n\nExecutives will hold a final “Go/No-Go” meeting on February 14 to determine if the AI-powered Alexa is ready for launch. Initially, the new service will be rolled out to a limited number of users for free, though Amazon has considered a subscription fee of $5 to $10 per month. The company will continue offering “Classic Alexa,” but has halted new feature additions to that version.\n\nThe new Alexa integrates AI technology from Anthropic, an AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. Despite delays due to concerns over response accuracy and speed, Amazon expects the AI-powered assistant to enhance daily tasks, from scheduling to shopping. Analysts at Bank of America estimate that if just 10% of active Alexa users subscribe at $5 per month, the service could generate $600 million annually.\n\nIf successful, the generative AI upgrade should reposition Alexa as a key player in AI-driven personal assistants.\n\nKnock, knock.

For enterprises deploying AI, this poses serious risks—from regulatory and compliance violations to reputational damage and worse.\n\nAnthropic, the AI research company behind the Claude family of LLMs, has launched a public test of its new Constitutional Classifier, a system designed to block jailbreaks that circumvent content restrictions. The test follows an extensive internal bug bounty program, where 183 security researchers spent more than 3,000 hours attempting to bypass the system—with limited success.\n\nThe classifier builds on Anthropic’s Constitutional AI, which uses a natural language constitution to define acceptable and unacceptable content. The system employs synthetic prompts to train against known jailbreak techniques, such as embedding harmful queries in benign-looking text, roleplay scenarios, or encoded language.\n\nDuring internal testing, the classifier successfully blocked 95% of 10,000 synthetic jailbreak attempts, compared to just 14% for an unprotected Claude model. However, the system carries a 23.7% computational overhead, increasing costs and energy consumption. It also mistakenly rejects 0.38% of safe queries, a tradeoff Anthropic deems acceptable.\n\nDespite these advancements, Anthropic acknowledges that no AI safety system is foolproof. The company expects new jailbreak methods to emerge but claims its classifier can quickly adapt to novel threats.\n\nFrom now until February 10, Anthropic is inviting the public to test its defenses by attempting to bypass the class prompt Claude into generating restricted content on chemical weapons. Successful jailbreaks will be disclosed at the end of the test. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "OpenAI has unveiled a new AI-powered research assistant, Deep Research, designed to help users conduct complex, in-depth inquiries using ChatGPT. This feature – aimed at knowledge workers in finance, science, policy, and engineering – is intended to provide a more rigorous and verifiable research experience, far beyond the chatbot’s usual quick summaries.\n\nDeep Research allows users to submit detailed queries and attach supporting documents. The AI then scours the web, analyzes data, and compiles a structured response, complete with citations. Unlike standard chatbot interactions, this process can take between 5 and 30 minutes. Users receive a notification when the research is complete. For now, results are text-only, but OpenAI promises that future updates will include images, data visualizations, and deeper integration with specialized databases.\n\nStarting today, Deep Research is available to ChatGPT Pro users with a 100-query-per-month cap. OpenAI plans to expand access to Plus, Team, and Enterprise subscribers soon, with higher query limits in the works. Initially web-only, mobile and desktop integration is expected later this month.\n\nThe Accuracy Question\n\nAI-generated content is notorious for hallucinations (fabricated information presented as fact). OpenAI claims to have mitigated this risk by using a specialized version of its o3 reasoning model, optimized for web browsing and data analysis. This model can parse large volumes of text, images, and PDFs, pivot in real time as it uncovers new information, and even generate and cite graphs.\n\nIn OpenAI’s internal testing, the model scored 26.6% on Humanity’s Last Exam: a deliberately difficult benchmark for AI research accuracy. While that might seem unimpressive at first glance, it outperformed Google’s Gemini Thinking (6.2%), X’s Grok-2 (3.8%), and even OpenAI’s own GPT-4o (3.3%).\n\nThe Real Test: User Behavior\n\nThe success of Deep Research won’t just hinge on accuracy—it will depend on whether users actually verify its findings. A well-cited AI response is great in theory, but if people blindly copy-paste without cross-checking sources, misinformation risks remain.\n\nAdding an ironic twist, OpenAI’s announcement comes just weeks after Google introduced an AI research feature with the exact same name.\n\nWhether ChatGPT Deep Research lives up to its promise – or simply becomes another overhyped AI feature – remains to be seen. But for now, OpenAI is doubling down on its vision of AI as a research assistant, not just a chatbot. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "ChatGPT became available to the public on November 30, 2022. I’ve given that date a name: the Curation/Generation AI Boundary (C/G Boundary). The C/G Boundary marks the transition from a time when AI was predominantly used to curate and organize preexisting content to a period characterized by AI’s capability to autonomously generate content and solutions. Prior to the C/G Boundary, any content you found on the public web had a 99 percent chance of being created by (or with the heavy hand of) a human. Each day after the C/G Boundary, a time we can call the Generative Era (GE), you are less and less likely to find content solely written by a human being.\n\nWe are about 2.5 years into the GE, and one thing is clear: humans are no longer the sole writers of human history.\n\nWith that in mind, the Authors Guild – the nation’s oldest and largest professional organization for published writers – has launched the Human Authored Certification, which allows an author to certify that their book is created by a human. “Human Authored” means that the text of the book was written by a human and not generated by AI, with the exception of minimal or trivial uses (such as AI applications that check spelling and grammar or for brainstorming or research).\n\nThe Human Authored Certification is currently available exclusively to the 15,000 members of the Authors Guild. It applies to books written by a single author, with plans to expand the program to include works by multiple authors and non-Guild members in the future.\n\nAccording to guild CEO Mary Rasenberger, “The Human Authored initiative isn’t about rejecting technology — it’s about creating transparency, acknowledging the reader’s desire for human connection, and celebrating the uniquely human elements of storytelling.” She added: “Authors can still qualify if they use AI as a tool for spell-checking or research, but the certification connotes that the literary expression itself, with the unique human voice that every author brings to their writing, emanated from the human intellect.”\n\nI’m not sure how I feel about this. “Human Authored” is not a quality certification; it’s a verification of human authorship. While it may assure readers that the content was crafted by a human, it doesn’t necessarily speak to the work’s literary merit or quality.\n\nWhat do you think about this? -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 3mo ago": "The U.S. Copyright Office’s latest report, Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, Part 2: Copyrightability, provides critical insight into how AI-generated works fit—or don’t fit—within existing copyright law. The key takeaway is clear: for a work to be eligible for copyright protection, it must demonstrate human authorship. AI can be used as a tool, much like a camera or a digital editing program, but the final output must be shaped by human creativity to qualify for protection.\n\n“After considering the extensive public comments and the current state of technological development, our conclusions turn on the centrality of human creativity to copyright,” said Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. “Where that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection. Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine, however, would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright.”\n\nThe report reinforces the longstanding principle that copyright is designed to protect human creativity, not machine-generated content. This means that if an AI system independently generates an artwork, a piece of music, or a written work without meaningful human input, it is not copyrightable. However, if a human exercises creative control over an AI tool—such as selecting inputs, editing outputs, or structuring the composition in a way that reflects personal expression—the resulting work may qualify for copyright protection.\n\nThis ruling has broad implications for industries that rely on AI to generate content, including publishing, music, design, and film production. Creators who incorporate AI into their workflows must ensure that they actively contribute to the final creative expression if they wish to secure copyright protection. This could mean curating datasets, fine-tuning prompts, or making substantial modifications to AI-generated outputs.\n\nFor businesses, this means rethinking AI-driven content strategies. Fully automated content may not be protectable under copyright law, potentially impacting ownership rights and monetization strategies. On the other hand, companies that blend human creativity with AI assistance could maintain strong legal claims to their intellectual property.\n\nAs generative AI tools become more sophisticated, expect ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny. The Copyright Office’s stance suggests that future policy will likely continue to emphasize human authorship as the foundation of copyright protection. This raises important questions: How much human involvement is enough? Could AI-generated content be protected under alternative legal frameworks, such as database rights or contractual agreements?\n\nFor now, businesses and creators using AI should take a cautious and strategic approach—ensuring human authorship is at the core of their creative process to secure legal protection. -s",

Previously Android-only, the service works where there’s no traditional cell signal. It’s just text for now, but voice and data are coming soon.\n\nFor now, the T-Mobile-Apple-Starlink system is in a limited beta and only available in the U.S. Apple already works with Globalstar for emergency satellite messaging, so this system gives iPhones two ways to bypass the need for a carrier connection. This raises a question: When Starlink reaches a critical mass of satellites, will traditional carriers become optional?\n\nAt the moment, the need for these partnerships is not solely due to the current number of satellites but also involves regulatory considerations and the desire to provide a comprehensive and reliable service. By partnering with established carriers, Starlink can leverage existing infrastructure and spectrum allocations, facilitating a more efficient rollout of its services. While expanding the satellite constellation is a priority, partnerships with carriers will continue to be a component of Starlink’s strategy – at least for now. -s",

Then, on January 20, DeepSeek-R1 launched, and it only took a couple of days to realize the game had changed. I explained what was going to happen in my Sunday essay, then simply reported on what some are calling our “AI Sputnik Moment” yesterday.\n\nWhy the history lesson? Because everyone should have known this was coming. To be very clear, it’s going to keep happening. We are living on the exponential. The cost ratio of OpenAI to DeepSeek is a pretty clear example of what an exponential shift in cost looks like.\n\nHere are some questions to consider. Beyond reacting to Wall Street’s “DeepSeek moment,” how will you take proactive steps to ensure your organization is prepared for the next exponential leap? Have you reached out to your AI vendors to discuss their roadmap for integrating models like DeepSeek-R1 or to explore cost-saving opportunities with localized deployments? Are you evaluating which of your workflows could benefit most from lightweight, on-premise AI models or even lighter-weight mobile-friendly models? Have you convened your leadership team to assess whether your organization’s infrastructure and processes are agile enough to keep pace with rapid advancements? Are you actively fostering a culture of continuous adaptability? What specific actions will you take today to position your organization for what comes next? Food for thought. -s",

In short: DeepSeek-R1, an open-source AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek, has shaken up the industry by delivering performance comparable to leading models like OpenAI’s reasoning engine o1, its LLM GPT-4, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet while operating at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough has sparked a debate: is DeepSeek-R1 a preview of a future driven by algorithmic efficiency or an outlier that reinforces the dominance of brute force foundational models?\n\nBy today’s opening bell, the U.S. stock reacted (as markets do) to its interpretation of the issue. At the time of this writing, major technology stocks are facing substantial declines. Nvidia’s shares have dropped nearly 12%, reflecting apprehensions about the sustainability of U.S. dominance in AI. Other tech giants (including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet) have also seen their stocks fall by approximately 3% in pre-market trading. The Nasdaq 100 index has decreased by 2.8% and the S&P 500 is down by 1.7%.\n\nFinancial pundits are saying that investors are beginning to question the substantial capital expenditures by U.S. firms in AI research, given DeepSeek’s cost-effective approach. Importantly, I am not a financial advisor, and nothing in this article should be considered financial advice. If you are considering any type of investment, you should conduct your own research and, if necessary, seek the advice of a licensed financial advisor.\n\nThat said, anyone who believes that they understand the future of AI (or its future computational requirements) is delusional. As with all things, the future will be a combination of every technique. Everything we know about hardware and software tells us that incremental improvement always includes a combination of algorithmic efficiency and increased hardware capabilities. People who sold their shares today believing that we’ve “reached the end” of hardware will get what they signed up for. That’s how markets work. -s",

Available initially to U.S. users on ChatGPT’s $200 Pro plan, Operator is positioned as OpenAI’s first major step toward realizing the promise of AI agents. Expansion to other user tiers and international markets is planned, though CEO Sam Altman noted Europe’s rollout would face delays.\n\nOperator’s functionality includes booking travel, making reservations, and shopping online. It operates through a Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, leveraging GPT-4o’s vision capabilities combined with advanced reasoning. Unlike conventional API-based agents, the CUA interacts directly with website interfaces—clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating menus like a human.\n\nSafety and user control remain priorities. Operator asks for confirmation before finalizing tasks (such as submitting orders) and requires user supervision for sensitive actions (like entering payment details). OpenAI emphasizes that Operator doesn’t collect or screenshot user data, with safeguards in place to mitigate risks like phishing and malicious prompts.\n\nOperator is not without limitations, however. It struggles with complex tasks, specialized systems, and CAPTCHAs, often requiring user intervention. Certain capabilities (like sending emails or handling banking transactions) are restricted during this research preview. Daily rate limits further cap usage. OpenAI’s cautious approach reflects concerns over potential misuse, such as automating phishing scams or exploiting ticketing systems.\n\nThe agentic landscape is getting crowded. All of the foundational model builders (and an uncountable number of startups) are trying to give AI tech stacks “agency.” It’s easy to understand the allure – who wouldn’t want to get what they want at the press of a button? – but get ready because the moment a baseline standard for agentic AI is agreed upon, everything we know about search, ecommerce, marketing, SEO, and the fundamental notion of browsing the web will change. -s",

Announced at a White House press conference, the project is backed by prominent figures such as Masayoshi Son, Sam Altman, and Larry Ellison, alongside President Donald Trump. The initiative will establish cutting-edge AI infrastructure across the United States, with the initial buildout commencing in Texas.\n\nThe Stargate Project is supported by a consortium of tech giants, including Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI. These companies are not only providing technological expertise but also significant financial backing. Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI are set to collaborate closely in the construction and operation of the new computing systems, ensuring that the infrastructure meets the demands of advanced AI applications.\n\nMicrosoft has reaffirmed its commitment to its partnership with OpenAI, extending key elements of their agreement through 2030. This includes access to OpenAI’s intellectual property, revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs. However, the exclusivity on new capacity is being adjusted, granting Microsoft the right of first refusal on any new capacity built by OpenAI. This strategic move underscores Microsoft’s pivotal role in supporting OpenAI’s growth and innovation.\n\nThe announcement of The Stargate Project was marked by political undertones, with Son and Altman attributing the project’s fruition to Trump’s election victory.

The clock was ticking—until President Trump stepped in with a last-minute executive order, extending the deadline by 75 days.\n\nHere’s the situation: TikTok briefly went offline for its 170 million U.S. users as ByteDance scrambled to comply with the ruling. While the app is operational again, you won’t find it in app stores until a deal is finalized. Trump’s extension gives ByteDance a lifeline, but it comes with strings attached. The president has floated the idea of the U.S. government taking a 50% ownership stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations, a bold move aimed at resolving national security concerns while keeping the app accessible.\n\nChina, surprisingly, seems open to negotiation. This marks a pretty significant shift from its earlier stance against a forced sale. American investors may play a crucial role in bridging the gap, but time is running out. If ByteDance can’t secure a buyer—or if negotiations falter—TikTok could face another blackout in the U.S. market.\n\nWhy does this matter?

AP’s VP of Global Business Development Kristin Heitmann called it “a new revenue stream for trusted journalism.” Licensing content isn’t a new idea, but the trend reinforces the value of the content and moves away from the controversies of algorithmic scraping.\n\nIn an unrelated story, OpenAI announced it is backing Axios’s expansion into four new local markets (Pittsburgh, PA; Kansas City, MO; Boulder, CO; and Huntsville, AL) as part of a broader $10 million investment in local news. Axios Publisher Nick Johnston noted, “This funding allows us to explore how AI can augment local journalism, ensuring communities stay informed while reducing operational costs.”\n\nBoth efforts reflect a shared mission: finding a path forward for the coexistence of professional journalism and AI. Google is betting on content licensing as a model for sustainability, while OpenAI is exploring whether AI can make local journalism viable through a tool integration strategy.\n\nThe bigger question is whether these approaches address journalism’s existential crisis. Will licensing agreements and AI partnerships fund the robust, investigative reporting that democracy depends on, or are these just tech-driven stopgaps that fail to address the underlying economic challenges of the news business?

It enables users to schedule future actions and reminders, akin to Google Assistant or Siri, but with the advanced language capabilities that ChatGPT is known for. With Tasks, users can now instruct ChatGPT to perform scheduled one-time or recurring tasks, such as providing daily weather reports, sports scores, or news digests.\n\nTo use it, select the “4o with scheduled tasks” option in ChatGPT’s model picker, then type out the desired task and specify when it should be executed. The system is also designed to proactively suggest tasks based on ongoing conversations, although users must approve these suggestions before they are set. Tasks can be managed directly within chat threads or through a dedicated Tasks section available on the web, allowing for easy modification or cancellation. Notifications are sent upon task completion across web, desktop, and mobile platforms, with a limit of 10 active tasks running simultaneously.\n\nThe introduction of Tasks is part of OpenAI’s broader ambition to expand ChatGPT’s role beyond simple conversation. Reports suggest that OpenAI is working on “Operator,” an autonomous AI agent capable of independently controlling computers, and “Caterpillar,” which could integrate with Tasks to enhance its functionality further.\n\nThis is exciting stuff, but remember, all AI tools can (and do) often provide unexpected results — that’s why this is a beta release. -s",

I spent a few hours wandering the CES floor and stumbled upon something extraordinary in North Hall: the Land Aircraft Carrier by XPeng AeroHT, a subsidiary of XPeng Motors.\n\nThis futuristic marvel combines an off-road-capable, six-wheeled electric van with a detachable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft neatly folded into the rear compartment.\n\nPriced under $300,000, the Land Aircraft Carrier has already secured more than 3,000 pre-orders, with deliveries set to begin in 2026. Buyers? Think thrill-seekers with deep pockets and emergency service agencies exploring next-gen capabilities. While regulatory hurdles may slow its rollout in Western markets, if you’re looking for a flying car you can drive around in an oversized SUV, this is for you! -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4mo ago": "NVIDIA Brings Generative AI to Your PC\n\nGreetings from Las Vegas. It’s Day 3 of CES 2025, and the show just keeps delivering new and awesome tech. One of the most interesting announcements of the past few days was by NVIDIA. It could mark a turning point in how we interact with AI.\n\nThe company unveiled a new lineup of RTX AI PCs powered by its GeForce RTX™ 50 Series GPUs, designed to run cutting-edge generative AI models locally. Until now, deploying powerful AI required access to massive cloud infrastructure. NVIDIA says its new GPUs, built on the Blackwell architecture, make it possible to run these models directly on consumer hardware, promising faster performance, better privacy, and greater accessibility.\n\nAt the core of this innovation are NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, a suite of tools designed to simplify AI integration. These microservices enable tasks like content creation, productivity enhancements, and even building AI-powered digital humans. Combined with preconfigured AI Blueprints, they lower the barriers for developers and creators to use generative AI in low-code and no-code environments.\n\nWhy is this important? First, it decentralizes AI, reducing reliance on cloud services. For businesses, this means data stays local, addressing privacy concerns and minimizing latency. Second, it puts high-powered AI in the hands of individuals, not just enterprises. Imagine using your PC to create lifelike avatars, produce multimedia content, or automate complex workflows—all with minimal technical expertise. While these claims will face scrutiny when the products launch in February, NVIDIA is betting that local AI will transform how we work, create, and innovate.\n\nBack in the day, there were mainframe computers, and only hobbyists had personal computers. You know what happened after the Apple II+. Is this history repeating itself? NVIDIA must think so. We’ll see. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4mo ago": "Day 2 of #CES2025 delivered a wave of announcements from smart vehicles to smart homes and green energy. Here are a few products that caught my eye.\n\nSony’s Afeela 1\n\nSony took a bold step into the future of mobility with the unveiling of the Afeela 1, a collaboration with Honda. This AI-powered vehicle isn’t just smart – it’s designed to connect seamlessly with its users, offering an interactive, personalized driving experience. At $89,900, it’s a signal that the future of cars is about more than transportation; it’s about integration. If you live in California, you can reserve yours with a $200 deposit.\n\nJackery’s Solar Roof and HomePower System\n\nJackery introduced its Solar Roof tiles capable of powering a home for more than four days during outages. For homeowners facing rising energy costs and climate instability, this innovation could be a lifeline, as well as a reminder that technology can lead the charge toward a greener planet.\n\nGame-Changing Advancements in Computing Hardware\n\nI generally hate the phrase “game-changing,” but in this case, all of this new gaming hardware is game changing. Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm showcased processors designed to embed AI into everyday devices, making computing smarter, faster, and more accessible. AMD’s Ryzen AI chips and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X promise to push AI capabilities into affordable PCs, ensuring businesses and consumers alike can harness the power of next-gen technologies. These chips will enable a wave of devices that adapt to their users, paving the way for a future where AI works seamlessly in the background.\n\nThe big news about CES 2025 is still AI, everywhere, all at once. We’ll get into that later this week. -s",

    "Shelly Palmer's post 4mo ago": "Greetings from Las Vegas. CES 2025 officially starts tomorrow, but I’ve been here for a few days attending press conferences and scoping out the exhibit floor. As many of you know, I am a BBQ/smoker enthusiast. Last year, GE’s indoor Smoker caught my attention. This year, it’s the Brisk It Zelos 450 Smart Grill with Generative AI. Why does a smoker need Generative AI? It doesn’t. Not in any way. That said…\n\nAs I walk around the CES show floor, I can literally smell the paint drying on the letters “AI” from booth to booth. The Brisk It grill takes this to another level and raises the philosophical question: When do humans benefit from AI?\n\nThe Brisk It 450 Smart Grill will not let you ruin your food. It will send you reminders and adjust the grill’s settings to ensure that you get a perfect cook. This sounds great, and it is great… if the outcome is your goal. If you’re looking for perfectly smoked brisket, AI (not generative AI, BTW) will do the trick.\n\nHowever, if the journey is your destination, AI is not only not the answer, but exactly what you don’t want. Smoking a brisket is a beloved process that requires time, attention, adult frosty beverages… long, exaggerated tales of past BBQ successes (and failures)… and a full day of wrapping, unwrapping, mopping, misting, firebox adjustments, love, and care. If the journey is your destination, AI is not going to help the process at all.\n\nJust a small philosophical ponderance at the advent of CES 2025. -s",

Here are my top 3 takeaways ...\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs report always makes for compelling reading, and especially now with the accelerated advances in Artificial Intelligence.  Here are my top takeaways from this year's report:\n\n🌟AI will reshape the jobs markets - by 2030 AI and Automation will replace some 92 million jobs BUT will create some 170 million new ones.  Humans can benefit from the net 78 million jobs being created but will need to start reskilling at pace\n🌟Skillsets are being made obsolete at pace - The current prediction of skills being made irrelevant due to industrialization, automation and AI is still holding true.  40% of existing skills will be redundant by 2030\n🌟Climate change focus will lead to new jobs - The renewed focus on reducing carbon emissions will see some 34 million jobs being created by 2030 in the electric vehicle and environmental engineering industries\n\nSo what can you do to stay individually relevant:\n\n💼 Pursue continuous learning - Make the time to enroll in self-paced AI and emerging technologies courses on MOOCs such as Ed-X, Coursera and Udacity\n💼Focus on your soft skills - Critical and creative thinking, emotional intelligence and teaming are still things that humans can do better.  Fine tune and hone these skills to allow you to work with and manage the machines in evolving new workforce configurations\n💼 Stay informed - Keep up to date on trends and new opportunities to learn by joining online and physical communities, conferences and training events\n\nRelevance is a choice.  It's your choice!\n\nWhat are your other suggestions on how we can drive our own relevance in the Future of Jobs?  Let me know below in the comments.\n\nP.S.

My kids are old enough now to understand and appreciate the significance of the very place where Nelson Mandela was arrested on 5 August, 1962.\n\nThis historic site includes a wonderfully curated museum and a striking sculpture by Marco Cianfanelli that’s made up of 50 columns of steel that reveal an image of Nelson Mandela’s face when viewed from a certain angle.\n\nArguably, this is where Mandela's journey to greatness began. The visit gifted me the opportunity to reflect on the lessons I could take into 2025 to help me lead myself and others better.\n\n\"What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead.\"\n~ Nelson Mandela\n\nMandela’s lessons are timeless. Here are 3 I took away that I will reflect deeply on going into 2025:\n\n1️⃣Visionary Leadership\nLike Mandela’s vision for a free and equal society, leaders need to have a clear and easy-to-understand vision that guides teams to deliver on business outcomes.\n\n2️⃣Resilience in the Face of Adversity\nWe must stand firm in our convictions and continue to push forward, no matter the challenges. Making a difference to business and society is not meant to be easy.\n\n3️⃣Empathy and Understanding\nMandela’s determination and skill to understand his opponents was key to his strategy to unite a highly divided nation. We need to do more to lead with empathy and build a culture that drives inclusion of all people and their perspectives.\n\nHave you had a chance to visit the Nelson Mandela Capture Site? What decisions have you made about how you will lead in 2025?\n\nPlease share your views in the comments below.\n\nFollow my free Elewa newsletter, delivered directly to your inbox at https://lnkd.in/dEBMvnv\n\n#Leadership #Empathy #Resilience #VisionaryLeadership #NelsonMandela #Inspiration #2025Goals #PersonalGrowth #LeadershipDevelopment #InclusiveLeadership #BusinessTransformation",

It's not just about grand, sweeping actions. It’s the little things that matter most. An empathetic conversation, a genuine compliment, or offering support during challenging times—these small acts can ripple outwards, creating an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nIn my experience, leading a business, with kindness as a core value, leads to greater employee engagement and satisfaction. It allows us to have the conversations that matter - the very ones that promote honesty and mutual respect and make for more resilient organizations.\n\nReconciliation Day is not just for South Africans.  It’s as good a day as any for us to all commit to making kindness a part of how we show up everyday.  \n\nIt starts with me.

Sustained high interest rates have prompted many consumers to hold onto their existing vehicles as they sought greater value for money and utility by buying pre-owned cars.\n\n2. South African Reserve Bank's 25bps interest rate decrease, coupled with sustained electricity supply (no load shedding) and positive sentiment towards the government GNU is driving positive consumer sentiment.\n\n3. Generational thinking (especially Gen-Z) is now a key consideration for the automotive industry as it contemplates growth.  This generation is most positive about our country over the next 12 months and they will continue to be key drivers of growth for financed vehicles.\n\n4. New Energy Vehicles (NEV) demand is growing albeit not at the rate of other markets.  Consumers are still concerned about range anxiety, the entry price point of electric vehicles, and the current public charging infrastructure.\n\n5. The future of mobility will see the rise of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and consumers will look to \"become mobile\" by using electric bikes, e-scooters and cheaper forms of ride sharing services. Vehicle ownership in the traditional sense will inevitably change.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video podcast.

How do we manage the concerns of our citizens and consumers?\n\nI had the honor of attending the inaugural launch of the “AI Leadership Club” at the Saxon Hotel, Villas and Spa last night.

It is harder to achieve than ever before, especially when we consider the challenges businesses are facing to do well in a tough business environment, the mental wellness pressures on employees, the prevalence of quiet quitting, and the rise of a global gig economy.\n\nGiven all of these pressures that business leaders and their executive teams face, we often look at our teams and consider different tools to help us understand individual performance - including things like performance calibration amongst groups, all the way through to succession planning for the future.\n\nI stumbled upon a Simon Sinek video recently where he discusses a Performance vs. Trust framework, which interplays a variety of permutations between high and low performance, versus high and low trust.  \n\nThe Performance vs. Trust framework  provides another lense into individual and team performance, especially when used alongside the typical “9 box grids” that compare Performance vs. Leadership Potential or even standardized performance distribution curves.\n\nFor me personally, Trust in the company’s vision and purpose, and trust in the leadership team is key to achieving the followership and leverage one needs to execute and deliver on a company’s results.\n\nOf course employees need to meet their employer halfway.  They need to want to grow and learn and deliver value for themselves and for the businesses they work for.\n\nThere is no perfect answer to how we build high performing teams.  Trust is however a key part of the answer.\n\nI would love to know your views on Simon’s video and the interplay of performance and trust.\n\n#leadership #culture #highperformance #business #trust",

However, it is all relative, and as an African I am always reminding my family, my friends, and our business, of the road we have travelled to this very point.  \n\nIt is the courage of our heroes, both lost to the struggle for Africa and those still alive and inspiring us to be more than our predicted future, that push us to believe that we can change Africa’s course. \n\nWe are starting to accelerate into our potential because we have chosen to own our challenges and to solve the problems that really matter, to realize the Africa we dream of.\n\nAfrica will be successful, of this I have no doubt.  However, we get to choose how long it will take.\n\nWhen we come together, united in purpose and in a spirit of Ubuntu, our dreams are not just valid - they are within reach.\n\nHappy Heritage Month!\n\n#heritage #heritagemonth #Africa #Leadership #business #bemorethan",

After what seems like a lifetime in strategy and transformation work, learning to stop and take stock of my surroundings, is not easy. It is both a mindset and an approach to help deliver a set of outcomes against the grain of your current reality.\n\nAmidst many of the pressures of the world we live in - the challenges of the economy, the frustrations of the hybrid world, or the reality that mental health is really taking strain - I find myself more often than not advocating for creating time for reflection.\n\nIt’s tough out there - and stopping to breathe, to take it all in, to consider, to choose - has become a super power.\n\nHere are 3 big reasons to embrace this technique:\n\n💡Team Morale - Stopping to gauge how the team is doing shows that we care as leaders and allows us to really get a sense of how things are going, and it is a key enabler to creating trust in the workplace.\n\n💡Problem Solving - I often find teams spiralling down the rabbit hole, not knowing which way is up anymore.  Stopping to reflect,  helps us check whether the approach we are taking still makes sense,  and lets us consider new views to adjust the approach to deliver improved chances of success.\n\n💡Personal Growth - Working at the pace we do, we don’t often take away key learnings to help us develop our own personal mastery.  Pausing to reflect, allows us to develop personal learnings as team members and as leaders.  There are no template answers to most of the challenges we face - pausing allows us to crystallize learnings and embed them into how we show up and work.\n\nOne of my big reflections is that the only person that can really decide how I show up every day is me.\n\nSTOP. PAUSE. REFLECT.\n\nIt starts with me. It starts with you.\n\n#leadership #mentalhealth #reflection #business #performance #personaldevelopment",

Keeping the optimism alive does however require one to keep at being self-motivated and to focus one’s time and energy on conversations and initiatives that try to move us forward.\n\nIn the earliest stages of South Africa’s Government of National Unity, post the recent national elections, I am even more optimistic about our country’s future.\n\nTransUnion South Africa had the chance this past week to host our 7th annual Financial Services Summit to  tackle the topic of “Charting a Course for Sustainable Growth”.  A packed audience had the chance to hear from our own TransUnion industry experts, and from key industry leaders such as STANLIB’s Kevin Ling, Absa Group’s Tshipi Alexander , Wonga’s Brett van Aswegen, Chenosis’s Waseem Amra, and GG Alcock. \n\nYou often hear me talk and write about Financial Inclusion.  This summit was our opportunity to extend the conversation and co-opt the industry into partnering with us to solve Africa’s biggest challenge.\n\nSome key takeaways for my fellow South Africans:\n\n1️⃣ Green shoots of structural improvements - With over a 100 days under the belt of no electricity load shedding, a concluded partnership with the Philippines to run our ports, and key conversations underway around sustainable water supply, the key elements to support economic growth are starting to come together.  Keeping the lights on should be good enough to move us to a 2% GDP growth!\n\n2️⃣ The Informal economy offers opportunities for growth - Big business and government alike have not done enough to see and realize the opportunities available for growth in small business (MSME/SMME) sector and in the township economy.  A different mindset is required!\n\n3️⃣ Consumers’ dreams and hopes can be made real - We demonstrated using empirical studies that consumers can be taught about their financial health and be empowered to take control of it.  Businesses need to invest more in financial literacy and education to help create tomorrow’s empowered consumers and small businesses!\n\nTogether, we can help South Africa and our beloved continent realize the potential we see in our hopes and dreams.\n\nIt starts with me.

My message was clear: financial inclusion is about more than just access— it's about creating sustainable opportunities that help people access financial products and then grow into their potential.\n\nIt’s clear that the Africa FinTech agenda is shaping up with the industry expected to grow 13x by 2030 - the highest growth of any continental region!\n\nA few key takeaways from my keynote:\n\n1️⃣The Mobile Wallet market is worth $1T  and is key to driving financial inclusion in Africa, with over 515 million unique smartphone users on the continent.\n\n2️⃣There has been an increase in first time access to credit (NTC) but a growing concern is that a large proportion of new to credit consumers quickly default on their loan agreements. Government and lenders need to do more to drive financial literacy and financial planning to move consumers across the lending continuum from savings to borrowing to creating leverage to grow businesses.\n\n3️⃣Africa’s growth depends on the sustained growth of MSMEs.  These businesses account for up to 80% of employment on the continent.  Lenders need to evolve their decisioning strategies to be quicker in making a call on loan extensions, and need to commit to using new innovative techniques to see the potential in small businesses, granting them controlled access to finances to start and scale their businesses.\n\nRemember that Financial Inclusion is Africa’s biggest challenge and opportunity. \n\nWe all have a role to play in creating a better life for all Africans.\n\nIt starts with me.

The benefits are easily seen in the resultant high performing cultures, business results and market relevance.\n\nI had the opportunity recently to be the opening keynote at the preeminent annual event for Human Resources directors at CHRO South Africa CHRO Day.  I was able to cover some of my lived experiences leading the realization of true diversity and inclusion.  \n\nSome key takeaways:\n1️⃣Clarity of Vision - The CEO needs to be fully bought in to the true power of DE&I.  If it’s central to our thinking as leaders, the business will see it in how we show up every day and it will become part of how we run our business.\n\n2️⃣Followership - The CEO needs a partner in the CHRO that can walk this journey with them, building an executive team that truly buys into the vision for DE&I transformation. \n \n3️⃣Culture - To truly entrench DE&I into the business and build leverage, the entire organization must buy into the transformation journey.  Democratize culture and get all levels of the employee base to be actively involved in building the culture that they want.\n\nI am blessed to have a wonderful executive leadership team at TransUnion Africa that walks this journey with me, and a powerful partner in my CHRO Ndivhu Nepfumbada that has supported the realization of this vision for our business.  \n\nOur work is ongoing and we will keep at it.\n\nI hope that my keynote and these key takeaways help other leaders and businesses that are looking to make DE&I a key part of their strategy.\n\n#DEI #diversity #CHRO #leadership",

If you want to go far, go together.“\n\nThe opportunity certainly exists for us as leaders to share examples of these successful strategies in practice.  \n\nTogether, we are unstoppable.\n\n#leadership #business #africa",

For the next decade, he would work with a first-class team of engineers and designers to revolutionise the home computer market before he and Sophie Wilson went on to design the ARM processor with a relatively small team and budget and with little inkling of the consequence it might bring to the world.\n\nIn 1990, Steve left Acorn moved to Manchester where he is now Professor of Computer Engineering at The University of Manchester.\nHe was charged with leading research into asynchronous systems, low-power electronics and neural engineering which led to the SpiNNaker project - a super computer incorporating a million ARM processors which are optimised for computational neuroscience. He is basically trying to reverse engineer the brain – a lofty ambition even by his own admission.\n\nIn this wide-ranging conversation, we discuss Steve’s life journey from studying maths with professors such as the famed John Conway and Sir James Lighthill to the highs and lows of building the BBC Micro and the story behind the ARM 32-bit RISC microprocessor.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/etbcfkga\n\n#computerscience #neuroscience #tech #innovation #design #arm #technology #mathematics #engineering",

At 13, he stood up to his abusive father in order to protect his mother. \n\nAt 14, he joined a magnet school, where a teacher named Mr. Russian saw his spark and mentored him in electronics. That passion never left him.\n\nFrom building traffic signal systems to heading to Fairchild and learning microprocessor design, Ed was always chasing the edge of #innovation. That journey led him to APF Electronics, where he helped create the MP1000 video game console — a groundbreaking 8-bit system that pre-dated many household names.\n\nBut when he proudly pointed to his creation on the shelf at Sears, the sales clerk’s dismissive response crushed him, “There’s no way you could have done this.” That moment stayed with him for years — silencing the pride he had every right to feel.\n\nYet today, Ed speaks openly and powerfully about his legacy:\n“To be a man of color and a leader in the video game industry will be my legacy — and one that I am very proud of.”\n\nLessons from Ed’s incredible journey pioneering the field of video games:\n\n📌 Representation matters\n📌 Where you come from does NOT define your potential\n📌 Never let anyone tell you what you CAN be\n\nEveryone should know Ed’s name. His story isn’t just about tech — it’s about resilience, vision, and breaking barriers.\n\n🎧 You can listen to Ed’s full story on my podcast https://lnkd.in/eMWmecKC\n📚 Read his books incl Imagine That!: The story of one of the first African Americans to work in the design of video games and personal computers https://lnkd.in/ebKUN4Nw\n\nAnd get in touch with him here on LinkedIn to book him in for talks.\n\nLet’s make sure pioneers like Ed Smith get the recognition they’ve always deserved.\n\n#TechHistory #RepresentationMatters #Inspiration #Leadership #VideoGames #STEM #EdSmith #Innovation #DiversityInTech #Trailblazer",

Let me tell you about #tech #pioneer Donna Auguste. \n\nDonna Auguste was the first African-American to enter the PhD programme at Carnegie Mellon studying AI, led the Newton engineering team at Apple and sold her own software business for $147 million. \n \nI first saw a picture of Donna Auguste in Doug Menuez great book – Fearless Genius: The Digital Revolution in Silicon Valley 1985 - 2000 … and I had to know more about her. A black woman leading an engineering team at Apple – her photo stood out – for all the right reasons, among a sea of pictures of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, John Sculley et al.\n \nTwo years later, and I got the exclusive chance to talk with Donna who shares her inspiring story on the podcast – from being the first African-American (man or woman) to enter the PhD program at Carnegie Mellon University researching #AI, to managing the Newton engineering team at Apple to selling her software business for $147 million. It’s all the more amazing when you learn the obstacles she had to overcome.\n \nWith a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley, Donna went on to research Artificial Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University where she spent the holidays interning at Xerox PARC in the early 80s before heading to IntelliCorp as a software engineer working on products which incorporated AI. She then went on to Apple before co-founding her own company - Freshwater Software.\n \nAs Donna says when discussing the VC’s reaction to her when fundraising, “They had a whole model of what they were looking for and I fit none of it.” \n\nDonna proved them wrong. And the lessons she shares shows that you can too, whoever… wherever you are.\n \n🎧 S2:E16 of The Danielle Newnham Podcast\n \n📖 https://lnkd.in/dmrRKkTR\n\n#womenintech #womeninbusiness #femalefounders #entrepreneurship #software #inspiration #startup",

    "Vani Kola's post 16h ago": "There’s a Sanskrit saying that has echoed in my mind lately: Vinasha Kale Viparitha Buddhi. “In times of decline, the mind turns destructive.”\n \nI can’t think of a more apt reflection for what’s happening to America’s most respected educational institutions, places like Harvard, which have long been symbols of intellectual rigor, open dialogue, and global collaboration. And more specifically, the quiet devastation now being felt by international students, many of whom arrived with hopes and dreams, just as I did nearly 40 years ago.\n \nIn 1985, I set foot on American shores as an international student. I came with the same optimism many students still carry today. I felt welcomed. My worldviews expanded as I encountered people who were curious about my background and who shared their own stories.\n \nToday, I feel distraught. It’s hard to put into words the emotions I feel watching this slow erosion of trust. Trust in institutions that stood as beacons of fairness and justice. Trust that if you worked hard, if you contributed meaningfully, you’d be given a fair chance. That your background, while part of your identity, wouldn’t become the sole lens through which you were judged.\n \nWhat is gained by eroding trust in educational institutions that have stood for decades as models of excellence and inclusion? What’s achieved by painting entire institutions with broad, politicized strokes? Who wins in this battle, where the collateral damage is students, used as pawns, many of whom came here on the promise of fairness, hard work, and justice?\n \nInternational students contribute immensely to the U.S., not just culturally and academically, but economically. In the 2023-2024 academic year alone, over 1.1 million international students contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs. At Harvard, international students make up about a quarter of the student body, enriching the campus with diverse perspectives and experiences.\n \nThis isn’t about one university or one issue. It’s about the broader implications of undermining institutions that shape not just minds, but futures. It’s about the message we send to the world: that America’s doors, once open to talent and ambition from every corner of the globe, are narrowing under the weight of internal discord.\n \nI don’t write this with anger. I write it with deep sadness, and a hope that we can pause long enough to consider the long-term damage being done. To remember that educational institutions aren’t battlegrounds for political point-scoring. They are sanctuaries for learning, for questioning, for challenging norms. For building bridges between cultures and nations.\n \nBecause Vinasha Kale Viparitha Buddhi is not just a cautionary phrase—it’s a warning. A warning that in trying to destroy others, we may end up damaging ourselves with short-sightedness.\n\n#HarvardUniversity #Diversity #Leadership",

𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘭𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘴 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘺𝘰𝘶.”\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, ever since I had a meniscus injury.\n\nNow, a meniscus injury isn't life-altering. But when walking without pain is no longer easy, when your daily routine of movement, nature, and yoga is disrupted, even this seemingly minor injury can shake you in unexpected ways.\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami said, \"𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲. 𝗦𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.\" Let me add that suffering is also deeply personal. A torn meniscus at 60 isn't quite the same as being 20 and facing paralysis. But the thing is, the human mind doesn't always calibrate objectively. We feel what we feel, and we suffer.\n\nBut the more important question is: What do you do with that suffering?\n\nI find myself tempted to rewind. What if I had rested more? Why did I join that group activity? \n\nThe mind runs itself in an endless loop of regret. Oddly comforting, but rarely useful. All we get is short-term relief and long-term heaviness.\n\nSo, what can we do? We can choose. We don't have a choice in undoing the past, but we can choose our attitude toward it. In that space between stimulus and response, like Viktor Frankl wrote, lies our meaning.\n\nHere are my takeaways:\n\n1. 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗽: Ruminating doesn't heal. Awareness and action can lead to progress. Committing to daily physiotherapy was the miracle drug. \n\n2. 𝗘𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗴𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗹𝘆: I did not have full mobility. Getting back to my full life meant acceptance of uncomfortable moments. Using a wheelchair in the airport was mortifying, but there was no option if I wanted to keep working. We should make wise choices where we invest our energy, with limitations that are not in our immediate control.\n\n3. 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿. 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝘀: Bad things may lead to good things. My doctor forced me to do thorough tests, which I tend to resist. This led to the discovery of severe osteoporosis in the back. Early awareness allows for a chance to prevent future fractures. \n\n4. 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲: Growth.\n\nHow we choose to endure suffering, how we frame our setbacks, can set us free. If we see a purpose in every problem, a learning that was essential for our future growth, perhaps walking this earth feels lighter and more adventurous.\n \n#Injury #Health #Technology #Leadership",

    "Vani Kola's post 3d ago": "How many things do we do in life simply because we tend to do so, not out of choice? This is one of those tricky questions I recently confronted: tendency vs. choice. \n \nA tendency is a natural inclination to act or think in one way. A choice implies a deliberate selection from many options. This made me think about my own patterns. I like to arrive ahead of time. I get anxious if I get late. So I overschedule. \n \nBut how much of our tendency is a cultivated habit? And how much of these patterns are just behaviors we have a choice to change deliberately?\n \nIs the tendency unconscious? There is a sense of helplessness about the tendency, as if it is beyond our control. Like being habitually late, for example. A choice is conscious. It can override your tendency once you are aware. \n \nThat's the pivot that got me thinking. The moment you know you have a tendency toward something, and we continue the same pattern repeatedly, isn't it a deliberate choice? \n\nWe have all said these things from time to time:\n\n“I have a tendency to stay up late.”  “I have a tendency to snap under pressure.” But if we are aware and still do it, it’s not a tendency anymore. It’s a pattern reinforced by repetition. So, how can we change?\n\n𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆. Identify the tendency. No sugarcoating. No excuses. Awareness is the first step. \n\n𝗢𝘄𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲. “I choose to binge-watch late tonight” sounds different from “I tend to binge-watch and hence sleep late, so I was unable to be prepared for the critical meeting today.” Make choices intentionally, even the bad ones.\n\n𝗕𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗵. We all have habits that don’t serve us. But blaming “tendencies” keeps us from building discipline. \"I know I do this, but I am trying to change it. I will eventually build the habit I want.\" It brings us a sense of hope.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆. Just because we’ve done something 10 times doesn’t make it a tendency. It is a choice made 10 times. And you can choose differently the 11th time. \n\nWhat strikes me most during this reflection is that if we can name it, we can change it. Until then, we are just outsourcing our responsibility to some \"tendency.\"\n\nWhat is a tendency you might want to change?\n\n#Choice #Technology #Innovation #Entrepreneurship",

I wonder if we are in the middle of a hidden boredom epidemic!\n \nFor previous generations, this question of boredom can be perplexing and confounding.\n\nLife offered distress, even deprivation. There were many difficulties and struggles in everyday existence. But rarely was there an opportunity to be bored!\n \nThere were just too many challenges to get through the day. And boredom, if there was time to get bored, perhaps would be welcomed as a friend, cherishing the privilege of time for mental wandering. \n \nBut now?\n \nAccording to a 2022-23 survey, more than half (57%) of Indian employees reported being unenthusiastic or bored with their current jobs. In 2021, over 21% of 8th and 10th graders and more than 45% of 12th graders r͟e͟p͟o͟r͟t͟e͟d͟ ͟frequent boredom.\n \nResearch shows that digital media is making us even more bored. We are occupied with scrolling, but we aren't necessarily happy. We have unlimited content. A new dopamine hit every few seconds. But we are not satiated.\n \nWhat happened to our free time? And what do we want to spend that time on? \n \nEveryone talks about more free time. It has overtones of being a fundamental human right. But few talk about what to 𝘥𝘰 with that time. There’s an implicit assumption that free time will be used for personal growth, creativity, a better lifestyle by improving physical and mental health, or a deeper life. \n \nYet data shows we are bored and afraid of being bored! Free time without meaning is not freedom; it's just restlessness. \n \nWe don't suffer from a lack of leisure or leisure activities. Boredom, if used right, could unleash new ideas and creative thinking. But we fill our time with noise, not depth.\nAs Nietzsche wrote: \"Any life can be borne, if its ‘why’ is clear.\"\n \nMaybe it’s time to create a personal manifesto about what gives meaning to our time and start listening to what our inner voice is trying to tell us.\n \n#Innovation #Technology #Digital #Future",

The results varied but the insight was clear: AI can assist, but the human lens remains essential.\n\nWe’re not being replaced by technology. We’re being reshaped by it.\n\nIn the age of AI, don’t outsource your voice. Augment it.\n\nLet the tool work for you.

It’s a decades old problem that persists.\n\nThe disconnect between animal models and human biology has led to inefficiencies and ethical concerns.\n\nIt’s a moral tug-of-war that once seemed unresolvable medical progress often came at the cost of animal welfare.\n\nMore than 115 million animals are estimated to be used in drug testing globally each year.\nShockingly, 95% of drugs shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials. And nearly 99% of animals used in scientific experiments are not protected by federal animal welfare laws.\n\n𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽 𝘀𝗮𝗳𝗲, 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗿𝘂𝗴𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴?\n\nScientists at Harvard University introduced a groundbreaking idea: creating replicas of human organs on tiny lab chips. Just as we’ve downsized from massive storage units to microchips in our devices, could we now miniaturize organs onto chips? I was thrilled to read about this development. I’ve often wondered about the moral cost of inducing disease in other living beings for the sake of our health.\n\n𝗢𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝘀-𝗼𝗻-𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀 (𝗢𝗼𝗖𝘀) are essentially tiny 3D cell cultures that act as a bridge between traditional animal testing and the complexities of human biology.\n\nOoC models consist of miniature tissue systems grown within microfluidic chips, lined with living human cells. These chips simulate human physiology, enabling drug development, disease modelling, and personalized medicine.\n\nWith OoCs, researchers can create more accurate and efficient models for testing human drugs reducing the likelihood of ineffective or harmful treatments.\n\nBy mimicking a cell’s microenvironment on a chip, we can study genetic factors, explore new treatment avenues for complex conditions, and even address rare diseases with limited sample sizes.\n\nOoCs also enable biomaterial testing, helping evaluate the biocompatibility of materials used in medical devices.\n\nRecently, a firm called 𝗘𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 tested a Liver-on-a-Chip device with 27 drugs that had passed animal trials but were toxic to humans. The chip accurately flagged 87% of these harmful compounds.\n\nI'm truly excited about the integration of tissue engineering and microfabrication to advance our understanding of human biology ethically and effectively.\n\nI hope to see a future where research and commercial applications in this space grow rapidly, helping us build a more humane and progressive health tech ecosystem one where millions of animals no longer have to suffer in the name of human progress.\n\nWatch this video by Harvard to learn more.\n\n#healthcare #technology #healthtech #innovation",

With a 5% interest rate applied annually on ₹8,30,000, you'd get ₹8,71,500 after one year. With quarterly compounding: ₹8,72,284. But with continuous compounding using 𝗲 you will get ₹8,72,555. The more frequent the compounding, the closer you get to e's natural growth rate. \n\nSimilarly, consider an avalanche. Starting with just 300 kg of snow, after sliding 100 meters, the mass can increase to over 10,000 kg and reach speeds of 80 km/h. Typical growth feeding growth analogy.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, one infected person led to 2.5 new infections per cycle. After just 10 cycles: over 9,500 cases—𝗲 in action.\n\nIt is even applicable to the virality of content on social media. The \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" went from a few videos to 17 million participants in 8 weeks, with the tipping point around day 20 when enough influential people participated.\n\nIn physics, after the Chernobyl disaster, radiation levels dropped by 50% within weeks for short-lived isotopes, while others will remain hazardous for centuries, following 𝗲'𝘀 natural decay pattern.\n\nWhen Netflix recommends your next favourite show, it's using algorithms powered by 𝗲 that help the system learn about 3-4 times faster than older methods.\n\nEuler's number reminds us that growth—in savings, knowledge, or connections—is rarely linear. It's dynamic, continuous, and often surprising in its accumulative power.\n\nWhat does e mean in your life?

𝘼𝙗𝙙𝙪𝙡 𝙆𝙖𝙡𝙖𝙢 \n\nThis quote came to my mind, watching Sahith Theegala lift that PGA trophy. \n\nHe didn’t just win a tournament, he won over everyone who’s ever been told they don’t quite fit the mold.\n\nNo silver-spoon golf academy upbringing. Just a kid with a fierce love for the game, a homemade swing, self-taught from YouTube videos and the kind of grit that’s impossible to teach.\n\nWhat stands out isn’t just Sahith’s game it’s the way he plays it. \n\nEmotional. Raw. Unfiltered. \n\nThere’s no schooled polish. Just heart.\n\nFrom standout performances at Pepperdine to pushing through injuries, near-misses, and public heartbreaks, Sahith’s rise hasn’t been meteoric, it’s been earned. \n\nSwing by swing. Day by day. Quiet, consistent hard work. The kind that doesn’t go viral.\n\nHe’s stayed grounded antithetical to a world built on filters and hype. Letting his game evolve without letting go of who he is.\n\nAnd when he finally lifted that PGA trophy, you could feel it meant something more. Not just for him, but for everyone who’s ever felt like an outsider in a space that wasn’t built for them.\n\nIs talent a gift of nature or something we nurture through effort and resolve?\n\nOne thing is clear to me: we may not all have equal talent, but we all have an equal opportunity to develop it if we put our minds to it.\n\nHis swing may be unconventional. But the lesson he offers? \n\n𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀. 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹.\n\nHere’s to all the Sahith’s dreaming their dream. \n1. Play your own game. \n2.

They remind us to revere our mothers for their unconditional love, for the quiet sacrifices that shape every life they touch.\n\nBut on this Mother’s Day, I can’t help but think of the hardest grief of all the grief of a mother losing her child.\n\nWar’s deepest scars are not always on the battlefield.\nThey’re etched on the hearts of women those who send their sons and daughters, fathers and brothers to fight, knowing they may never see them return.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, Gandhari, the mother who lost all her hundred sons in the great war of Kurukshetra, turns to Krishna and says bitterly:\n“𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬.”\n\nAnd Krishna, silently accepting her curse, reminds her, and us, that destiny plays its own role, even when hearts break.\n\nA mother’s lament: powerful, powerless, and painfully timeless.\n\nFrom ancient epics to modern conflicts, war continues to take from mothers:\nTheir peace.\nTheir children.\nTheir futures.\n\nSo today, let us not only celebrate motherhood, but also pause to pray for all the mothers enduring the unimaginable loss of a child. For strength, for healing, for the grace to carry on what no one should have to bear.\n\nLet this be our hope and our prayer:\n\nMay we build a world where no mother fears the knock on the door.\n\nMay peace be more than a pause between wars.\n\nAnd may we honor mothers not just in sentiment, but in the choices we make as a society.\n\nThe mutually agreed cease-fire is the best news for Mother’s Day.\n\n#HappyMotherDay #Leadership #Mother",

She speaks candidly about her experiences with poverty, often highlighting the invisibility and lack of resources that come with it. She once said:\n\n“𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘰𝘳, 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘷𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦. 𝘕𝘰𝘣𝘰𝘥𝘺 𝘴𝘦𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘰𝘳. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. 𝘠𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰 𝘰𝘯𝘦'𝘴 𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤.”\n\nShe also notes:\n\n“𝘐𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘯'𝘵 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘥 𝘱𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘺, 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘢𝘯'𝘵 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘪𝘵. 𝘐𝘵'𝘴 𝘴𝘰 𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘴𝘦, 𝘴𝘰 𝘵𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵.

𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹: Money can buy comfort, but it can’t buy purpose. \n \n2.

Alok emphasizes the importance of understanding money not just earning it. \n\nReading this book made me reflect on my own journey.\n\nWhen I started my first company, I was driven by the desire to create something meaningful.\nMoney was a byproduct, not the goal.\n\nOver the years, I’ve seen so many entrepreneurs caught up in the pressures of fundraising and valuations.\n\nThis book is a timely reminder to stay focused on what truly matters.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆?\n\n#𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆 #𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 #Entrepreneurship",

Like a simple biscuit, for instance.\n\nI was at a friend's home in the US last month when she pulled out a familiar packet with that iconic girl on the front. \"𝘊𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘪 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦,\" she smiled. \"𝘗𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘨𝘪𝘢.\"\n\n𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗹𝗲-𝗚. The glucose biscuit that’s been a part of chai rituals in Indian households since 1939.\nInterestingly, biscuits weren’t even part of traditional Indian cuisine. The British introduced them in the 1800s as luxury items. An 1880s survey showed that only 2% of Indian households consumed them regularly compared to 87% of British homes in India!\n\nEverything changed during the World Wars, when Indian soldiers developed a taste for these portable snacks.

From being distributed during the 1943 Bengal famine, to feeding soldiers during Kargil, to becoming the first snack many buy when moving up economically...\n\nOne unassuming biscuit that tells a story of 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵.\n\nWhat’s the food that makes 𝘺𝘰𝘶 nostalgic, especially when you're away from home?

Not exactly on everyone’s travel bucket list.\n\nStill, about 100,000 people visit Antarctica every year at a cost of INR 10 lakhs per person!\n\nIn 1983, at age 30, Dr. Aditi Pant made history as one of the first Indian women to set foot on Antarctica as part of India’s Third Antarctic Expedition.\n\nHer journey began far from the ocean. In her memoir An Oceanographer’s Life, she shares how her scientific curiosity was sparked by her father, who had a keen interest in how things worked and why.\n\nThis early exposure to scientific thinking, combined with her father's love for hiking and trekking, instilled in her a desire for a career that allowed freedom of movement, not only of thought.\n\nDr. Pant’s sheer determination soon led her to Pune’s Institute of Science for marine biology, then to Westfield College, London, where she earned her PhD — breaking barriers as one of the few Indian women in this field internationally.\n\nIt makes me wonder: Are we born with a path, or are we meant to find it through detours and discovery? \n\nAs parents, how much should we guide the future of our children, and how much should we let them wander toward what calls them?\n\nHer selection for the 1983 expedition came after five years of distinguished research at the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa.\n\nFor 16 weeks at India’s Dakshin Gangotri station, Dr. Pant conducted pioneering research on ocean salinity and marine ecosystems in the Southern Ocean.\nThe Antarctic experience? \n\nEndless white landscapes, isolation from familiar sights and sounds, and the absence of colors beyond white and blue. For us, it seems profoundly disorienting but for Dr. Pant, it was scientifically invaluable.\nHer findings established important connections between Antarctic water temperature variations and Indian monsoon patterns, research that continues to inform climate science even today.\n\nIn Antarctica, equipment failures meant improvising solutions with limited resources. Communication blackouts left the team isolated. When temperatures plunged to -38°C, survival itself became the experiment, testing not just her scientific skills but her resilience.\n\nAfter Antarctica, Dr. Pant continued her pioneering work at the National Institute of Oceanography, where she helped establish crucial marine research initiatives.\n\nHer achievements earned her the Padma Shri in 2013.\n\nHer story makes me wonder: When uncharted territories come calling, where do we find the courage to say yes?\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘜𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘏𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢'𝘴 𝘚𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐𝘯𝘯𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.\n\n#WomenInScience #Leadership #Innovation",

Don't let emotions cloud reality and practicality.\n\nIn the startup ecosystem, we celebrate resilience in facing market challenges and pivoting business models. But perhaps the most profound resilience is the emotional ability to hear difficult truths about your leadership, your product, or your strategy and use them as catalysts rather than obstacles.\n\nHave you found it harder to give tough advice or to receive it?\n\n#Leadership #Entrepreneurship #Startup",

If you have, let me know in the comments what situations trigger self-doubt in you.\n \nFor me, when I think my decisions affect others, I tend to agonize over whether I am making the right decision. This process, though painful, then leads to courage and acceptance to make that decision regardless of others’ approval or opinion.\n \nA large majority grapple with feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about their abilities, especially in the early stages of their company growth.\nBut how do we break this cycle?\n\nStanford University research found: Resilient founders embrace self-doubt as a tool. Suppress it, and you are likely to make a significant error in judgment sooner or later. Let it paralyze you into indecision; failure is guaranteed.\n\n10 ways founders unknowingly sabotage themselves:\n\n1.When confidence turns into overconfidence:\n→ ignore risks\n→ burn bridges with good advisors.\n\n2. When you stop questioning your assumptions:\n→ Smart people stop working for you\n→ Save your money on data science groups; it is wasted on you.\n\n3. When early success makes you resistant to feedback:\n→ Your ego doesn’t let you be wrong\n→ You have become an inspiring leader, instead of a receptive one who fosters growth and collaboration by welcoming diverse perspectives\n\n4. When hiring is about people who agree with you:\n→ You have short-term satisfaction\n→ Not building a long-term team\n\n5. When ‘hard work’ is not balanced with strategic thinking:\n→ You’re busy giving out Gyan\n→ But not productively solving problems\n\n6. When you avoid difficult conversations:\n→ You're pushing out the inevitable bad news when it is likely to be more painful → And multiplying damage\n\n7. When you pivot too often or not at all:\n→ You’re reacting\n→ Not adapting\n\n8. When you celebrate funding more than execution:\n→ You’ve got short-term social media status\n→ Not the championship of a sustainable race\n\n9. When setbacks feel personal:\n→ Identity tied to singular outcomes can devastate\n→ Losing growth opportunities and learning\n\n10. When the mission starts feeling like a burden:\n→ You need to deeply reflect on your priorities\n→ Be honest in setting goals\n\nReminder: Doubt is a signal, not a weakness. The best founders listen, learn, and lead through it.\n\nWhat has been your biggest wake-up call as a founder?\n\n#Leadership #Entrepreneur #Startup",

No one wants to be in the gutter. At least, not literally. \n\n*“Gutter”* has an unsavoury ring to it today. It conjures up images of dirt, despair, and being at one’s lowest point in life. But the word hasn’t always meant that. Language, like life, evolves. \n\nOriginally, gutters referred to channels carved by dripping wax from candles or rainwater running along rooftops—nothing disgraceful. But over time, meanings shifted. The gutter became symbolic of being down and out, on the margins, at the bottom. \n\nLife, in all its unpredictability, has a way of dragging us down sometimes—into stress, into chaos, into the depths of our own emotions. \n\nThe other day, my well-planned 90-minute commute to the airport turned into a 3.5-hour crawl. Plans derailed. Stress levels spiked. And the world moved on. As it always does. \n\nThe faster I let go of the frustration, the quicker I could laugh at the absurdity of it all. The faster I stopped raging against the traffic, the sooner I could look up. That’s what it means to see the stars when you’re in the gutter. \n\nTo accept. To adapt. To stay open to beauty and perspective—even when things don’t go our way. \n\nIt's not just about poetic optimism. It's a stubborn kind of resilience. The kind that refuses to let the lows define us. \n\nTo all those navigating their own versions of the gutter—find the stars.\n\n#Leadership #MondayMotivation #Startup",

    "Vani Kola's post 4w ago": "\"I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others.\"\n\nThese words struck me the most from Pope Francis' last Easter speech. This wasn't a grand theological declaration from one of the most revered spiritual and religious leaders followed by 1.3 billion people worldwide. \n\nIn these words, I find a call to care about those we often consider as 'the other,' to find hope where destruction looms, and peace where violence dominates. \n\nUnfortunately, we are steeped in a turbulent world with conflicts escalating and tolerance evaporating. This is a world where the vulnerable are hit the hardest, with hardened hearts that see no reason to extend relief. \n\nThe Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, yes, but his final message went beyond the boundaries of religion. He reminded us that true humanity lies in how we treat the most vulnerable among us. This is what will define humanity.\n\nHe reminded us that compassion isn’t a virtue reserved for religion. It’s a responsibility we carry, regardless of what political ideologies we support. Across faiths, philosophies, and worldviews, his message is relevant: To hold on to our compassion and humility, and to offer dignity and hope for those who often don't find it. Because how we treat those with the least power says the most about us.\n\nHis passing made me pause and reflect. We are quick to celebrate our achievements and protect our comfort.  At times, we are immune to reflecting on inequality and suffering. \n\nBut any system, be it economic, political, or spiritual, that ignores the suffering of others and dodges peace is built on a foundation that eventually collapses. Pope Francis' message of peace couldn't have come at a better time. Because when he said, \"There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others,\" it wasn't just a message for those who follow him as Catholics, but a call for all of us who believe in a kind and just humanity. \n\nThat's our collective responsibility: to build a kinder and more peaceful world. In the end, that's what faith in humanity looks like. \n\n#Leadership #Humanity #PopeFrancis",

There's immense internal pressure to appear knowledgeable and decisive at all times.\n\nThis pressure creates leaders who:\n• Bluff through conversations\n• Make decisions with insufficient information\n• Avoid difficult questions\n• Miss learning opportunities\n  \nWhen leaders have the confidence to acknowledge what they don’t know, they create a culture that empowers everyone to bring their best and continue learning.\n\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘂𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀:\n🔹 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁 People sense insincerity.

That challenges our sense of what an object is and tricks our perception?\n\nThat’s the Möbius strip — an intriguing mathematical object that redefines our understanding of space and form.\n\nTake a simple strip of paper. Now twist one end halfway and attach it to the other end, forming a loop with a twist. You’ve just created a Möbius strip!\n\nRun your finger along the surface. You’ll find yourself traveling what seems like the \"inside\" of the strip, only to magically end up on the \"outside\"—without ever crossing an edge.\n\n𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 — 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲!\n\nAnd it’s not just Tony Stark who used the Möbius strip for time travel in 𝘈𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘳𝘴: 𝘌𝘯𝘥𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦.

Its never-ending twist symbolizes infinity, self-reflection, and continuity — inspiring sculptures, jewelry, and architecture.\n• And housewives like my mother, who rotated mattresses regularly, intuitively understood this concept — using it to extend the life of household items.\n  \nRecently, Google Japan released the 𝗚𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 — a double-sided keyboard based on the Möbius strip. As bizarre as it may sound, it can be used by more than one person at the same time.\n\nThe Gboard’s double-sided ortho-linear design connects 26 modules, each with eight key switches. That’s 208 keys — more than twice as many as a regular keyboard.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘆? 𝗬𝗲𝘀. 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹? 𝗨𝗺… 𝗺𝗮𝘆𝗯𝗲?\n\nThe Möbius strip reminds us that reality is often more surprising than it seems.

They show us the universe is full of surprises — and that there’s always something more to discover.\n\nIt reshapes our assumptions — urging us to look beyond the familiar.\nAnd after all, don’t we all love a twist in the tale?\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴.\n\n#mathematics #nature #science #learning #education",

The ocean was in motion—foaming and fierce. Towering sea stacks stood alone, shaped by centuries of waves.\nJust inland, ancient redwoods rose in quiet majesty, their presence both grounding and awe-inspiring. In that stillness, I felt drawn to gather my thoughts on nature and the lessons it holds for me.\n\nStanding at the edge of the Pacific, it's easy to be lulled by the ocean’s rhythm—the glint of sunlight on the waves, the sound of breakers kissing the shore. But beneath the surface lie rip currents, rocky shelves, and undertows.\n\n𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐩𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲.\n \nPopular, exciting, even sexy from the outside. But diving in without understanding the underlying terrain can pull you under. The ocean teaches us to prepare, to listen, to respect complexity before plunging in.\n\nFollow the lure, yes—but chart your course. Don’t mistake momentum for mastery.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐚 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤: 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧\n\nDid you know sea stacks are stones in the ocean formed over millennia? Waves erode cliffs, leaving behind only the strongest rock. Let time and tension refine your idea. \n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐰𝐨𝐨𝐝: 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐖𝐢𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐜𝐲\nCoastal redwoods can grow over 350 feet tall, yet their roots run only 6–12 feet deep. Their strength comes from interlocking with their neighbours—a quiet, unseen community.\n\nI’ve always been drawn to these giant trees; they feel like ancestors, beckoning to share their knowledge.\n\n“𝘐𝘧 𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘢 𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘬 𝘪𝘯 𝘩𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺, 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘶𝘳𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘐 𝘥𝘰?”\n \nThe answer comes, whispered in the wind through the branches:\n\n“𝗜 𝗮𝗺 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗼𝗻 𝗵𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵.”\n\nEverything I build, everything I strive toward, should aim to make life better for someone other than myself. We each leave a trace—not in legacy headlines, but in the quiet ways we uplift others.\n\n“𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘯.” — 𝘌𝘮𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯\n \nLeadership isn’t about being remembered. It’s about planting something that helps others grow.\nThese moments in Mendocino weren’t just beautiful, they were instructive. Nature became mirror, mentor, and muse.\n\nAs founders and leaders, we often seek clarity through doing but sometimes, clarity finds us when we stop doing.\n\n𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂?\n👇 I’d love to hear what place, moment, or element helped you reflect more deeply on your purpose.\n\n#Leadership #Musings #Entrepreneur",

When Pickering grew frustrated with his male assistant’s work, he reportedly said that his maid could do a better job and promptly hired her at the Harvard Observatory.\n \nAnd she proved him right by becoming a famous astronomer.\n \nShe had no formal training in astronomy, having moved from Scotland to America at 21. She was forced to be a maid, having been abandoned by her husband when she was pregnant. She took the work she could find, to support herself and her child, which led her to Pickering’s household.\n \nI know it sounds like a bizarre coincidence, but points to talent and competence lurking in unlikely places waiting to flourish given right circumstances.\n \nOne of her most remarkable discoveries was the Horsehead Nebula in the Orion constellation. It’s now one of the most recognizable features in the night sky, yet few know it was Fleming who first recorded it.\n \nBack then, identifying something like this wasn’t as simple as pointing a telescope. Fleming had to analyze faint details in photographic plates, work requiring extreme precision. She also identified white dwarfs and developed the first system to classify stars. On top of that, she also discovered 10 novae, 59 nebulae, and over 300 variable stars.\n \nIn addition to her astronomical research, Fleming was responsible for managing the Henry Draper Memorial, a program to systematically photograph, study, and describe stellar spectra.\n \nThe Harvard Star Catalog, a major work in astronomy, was credited to Pickering, not her. Even so, Fleming instead of giving way to disappointment, kept at it. In 1906, she became the first American woman elected to the Royal Astronomical Society. Recognition came, but only after years of quiet hard work.\n \nHer tombstone reads: “Astronomer.” Nothing more. No mention of the challenges she faced. Just the work she did.\n \nIt makes me think, how many others like her are missing from the stories and opportunities to create impact?\n \n#Innovation #Leadership #Technology",

    "Vani Kola's post 1mo ago": "When I scroll through AI leadership profiles, I see a pattern that is so predictable that it's almost algorithmic itself - men, men, and more men. \n\nIn a field shaping humanity's future, only 12% of AI researchers globally are women. This isn't just a diversity issue; it's a design flaw in our digital future.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. With just 11 women among 136 founding team members of major AI companies valued over $500M, we're allowing critical technologies to develop with massive blind spots. \n\nMeanwhile, India's 10M+ tech workforce faces transformation, with AI potentially replacing up to 50% of voice-based roles and 30% of IT service positions.\n\nThis disruption can either entrench existing inequalities or create new pathways for inclusion. \n\nThe choice isn't automatic - it depends entirely on who designs these systems and for whom they're designed.\n\nAt Kalaari Capital, we view this imbalance as both a moral concern and an untapped opportunity. Our investment thesis increasingly focuses on founders building inclusive AI applications that bridge India's stark digital divides rather than widening them.\n\nIndia stands at a pivotal moment, ranked 4th globally for AI preparedness. Our homegrown innovations like Sarvam 1 demonstrate our technical capabilities. Now we must demonstrate our commitment to ensuring women help architect our AI future, not just adapt to it.\n\nIf you're a woman building in AI, I would love to hear from you. If you're an investor or tech leader there is a need to build AI that is ethical and inclusive for all of humanity. \n\n#AI #Technology #Leadership",

It's not just philosophy—it's mathematics.\n\nImagine tracing your family tree back through the generations. You start with two parents, four grandparents, and eight great-grandparents. Keep going back a thousand years, and you’d find that your ancestors number in the millions. Push back a few thousand years, and the lines of separation begin to blur.\n\nThe truth is, all of humanity shares common ancestry, and yet, history tells a different story—one of division by race, religion, geography, and ideology.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐟 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲\n\nGenetic studies confirm that all humans today can trace their lineage to a common ancestral population from about 7,000 years ago. Despite outward differences in appearance, our DNA remains 99.9% identical across all people, highlighting how minor our distinctions truly are. This paradox happens because our family trees start overlapping—many ancestors appear multiple times due to intermarriage and shared lineages.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐨𝐱 𝐨𝐟 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧\n\nThroughout history, we've created artificial divisions based on superficial differences. Borders, faiths, and ideologies have separated us, even though we all share the same ancestral roots. Colonialism, slavery, caste hierarchies, and racial discrimination are stark reminders of how we have created artificial barriers among ourselves. Wars have been fought over beliefs and identities, even though, in essence, the people on both sides of these conflicts are distant relatives, tracing back to the same ancestral roots.\n\n𝐀 9,000-𝐘𝐞𝐚𝐫-𝐎𝐥𝐝 𝐌𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐇𝐢𝐬 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐭\n\nScientists recently found that a 9,000-year-old skeleton with dark skin has a living descendant today with light skin—the primary difference after nine millennia being only skin colour. This underscores how superficial our perceived differences are.  Beneath it all, we are bound by the same genetic thread, a single, expansive human family.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐖𝐢𝐬𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐟 𝐕𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐝𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐯𝐚 𝐊𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐦\n\n\"The world is one family\"—this ancient concept found in the Maha Upanishad, speaks to the fundamental truth that all humans are interconnected. It promotes a vision of universal brotherhood, one where artificial barriers of race, nationality, and creed dissolve in the face of our shared humanity.\n \nIn a time of rising divisions, perhaps it is this ancient wisdom that we need the most.\n \nIf we recognize that we are all part of the same great lineage, then the reasons for hatred and exclusion fall away.\n \nThe world has always been one family—it’s just time we start living like it.\n\n#Leadership #Innovation #Humanity",

And what or who is a genius anyway? I pondered this question many times after labelling myself as not being one.\n\nIs genius about how much you know, or how well you apply it? The people I labelled as geniuses wrote books in a way I never could. Or spoke with command on facts and figures about past and future in a way I admired. Or solved complex problems easily in math or physics or other subjects that I enjoyed and was good at, but never that good. \n\nI never wished I was a genius, because I saw people who were very smart living a complex or sad lives because they were expected to live up to a certain expectation. \n\nI first came across Marilyn vos Savant when I read about her IQ of 228—the highest ever recorded. You'd think someone that smart would be a scientist or a professor.\n\nShe didn't lock herself in a lab. She instead made thinking fun. She broke down complex ideas, answered tricky logic puzzles, and challenged how we see intelligence.\n\nBorn in 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri, Marilyn was solving math problems beyond her grade level as a kid. By her teenage years, she had already taken two intelligence tests that placed her IQ at 228 - so high that she made it to the Guinness World Records.\n\nBut instead of following the usual path of high-IQ geniuses, she chose something different. She became a writer, using her intelligence to make people think.\n\nHer Parade magazine column, \"Ask Marilyn,\" became famous for tackling logic puzzles and real-world dilemmas. Readers sent in brain teasers, and she explained them in simple terms.\n\nOne of her most famous answers? The Monty Hall Problem—a probability puzzle about a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the other two, goats. You pick a door, and the host (who knows where the car is) opens another door, revealing a goat. You're then asked: stick with your choice or switch?\nMarilyn advised, always switch. Doing so doubles your chances of winning.\n\nMathematicians and PhDs didn't believe her. Hundreds wrote in, insisting she was wrong. Some even mocked her.\n\nBut she was right. And when experts finally accepted her logic, she changed how people think about probability and decision-making.\n\nMarilyn never made intelligence feel intimidating. She proved that being smart is not about knowing everything—it's about using knowledge in a way that helps others.\n\nAnd her story leads to an important question: Are we using what we know to make life easier for others? Or just to prove how much we know?\n\nWhat is your definition of genius?\n\n#Leadership #Innovation #Knowledge",

Global stars flying in, local talent stepping up, and concerts becoming cultural milestones. \n\nWe have all heard about a ₹10 lakh Coldplay ticket being resold in Ahmedabad. \n\nBut how about a ticket for ₹10 lakh? That’s more than most people make in a year. Is any concert worth that? What exactly are we paying for - the music or the bragging rights?\n\nIt got me thinking about homegrown talent. India isn’t short on incredible musicians. With legends like Zakir Hussain, Lata Mangeshkar, and AR Rahman, we have a musical legacy that spans centuries. They would never command ticket prices that international artists have in India. Why is it that we go all out for visiting artists but don’t shell out when it comes to supporting our own? I understand the music genres are different, but that alone doesn’t explain the dichotomy. \n\nIt’s perception - a global artist feels like a status symbol, an Instagram-worthy moment. Meanwhile, our local artists, no matter how talented, often get boxed into smaller, less glamorous spaces.\n\nIt’s not about the price of a ticket. It’s about what we, as a culture, choose to value. Are we there for the music, or for the “I was there” moment?\n\nCan we change that perception? Shouldn’t Indian artists be supported more extensively? How can we make supporting homegrown talent feel as aspirational as attending an international show?\n\nThe true magic of a concert isn’t just about who’s on stage. It’s about the moments that stick with you - the ones where the music moves you and makes you feel something real.\n\nWhat do you think can make better patronage for Indian artists that they deserve?\n\n#india #music #lifestyle #economy",

Whether you are a sports person or an entrepreneur, this trait separates the greats from the good.\n\nI often see this truth unfold in startup journeys.

    "Vani Kola's post 1mo ago": "Can we ever truly please our parents?\n \nA founder I met recently shared a familiar story. He once came home, scoring 90% on a test, only for his father to ask, \"Where did you lose the remaining 10%?\"\n \nWe have all experienced some version of this, haven't we? It reminded me of my childhood. I once scored 90% on a Math exam, and my teacher's immediate reaction was similar: \"What happened to the missing 10%?\" She encouraged me to reach for more and not accept that I had done as well as possible. In this case, the missing 10% was a series of truly careless mistakes of overconfidence. \n \nUnderneath both these stories, there wasn't a lack of pride but a philosophy of excellence—the belief that there is always room for improvement, to push for more, that perfection is not the goal, but excellence is. Our parents had a quiet but firm expectation that we always strive for more.\nThis is why I smiled when I read Kenzaburō Ōe’s story.\n\nAs a child, he dreamed of becoming a physicist. He begged his mother to let him study in Tokyo, promising her, “I will win the Nobel Prize in Physics.”\n\nDecades later, he returned home as promised. As a Nobel Laureate. But in Literature. By any standards, a fantastic achievement.\n\nHis mother’s response? “You promised it would be in physics.”\n\nAnd there it was—that familiar, knowing humour our parents are gifted with. On a more reflective note, Kenzaburō Ōe’s story shows us that our paths in life aren't always fixed. Our ambitions shift, our paths change, and we often land somewhere different from where we first imagined. \n\nThe real lesson is not about chasing that missing 1% or 10% but recognizing that growth doesn't follow a straight line. That our interests and passions can shift over time. Allow yourself to evolve. Life has its way of leading us to where we are meant to be.\n\n#Motivation #Leadership #Innovation",

Small routines, perhaps back breaking work, put simple, piping hot, tasty, nutritious meals on the table, every meal.  In our home we ate sitting on the floor, and I think that contributed much to my flexibility and mobility without my knowing about it.\n\nToday, we can tap the phone and have virtually any cuisine arrive at my doorstep in <30 minutes.\n\nWhile this convenience revolution fascinates me as an investor it concerns me as someone who values health. I prefer fasting to consuming fast foods, and I rarely order food delivery and avoid processed foods. I know this sounds cumbersome used to the modern conveniences as we are. But I find cooking a simple meal and consuming it with no distractions highly therapeutic to my otherwise hectic life. \n\nWhat strikes me most is how our relationship with food has changed so rapidly.\n\nMaking a cup of coffee was a satisfying ritual to start the morning, replaced with a hurried pick up on the way to work. Traditional rhythms of meal planning and family sharing have been compressed into a scrolling interface optimized for conversion, not nutrition.\n\nMy grandmother, wherever we expressed dislike of any food she prepared, insisted food was the best medicine for the body and soul. Yet the algorithms serving our meals are designed for convenience and cravings, not nourishment.\n\nI'm not advocating we abandon innovation.\n\nI've built my career investing in technological progress. But I question whether we've understood the trade-offs as our food systems transform at unprecedented speed. From agriculture to the processed industry, supply chain to the cloud kitchen, we rarely have any idea of our food source.\n\nThe rising diabetes rates, increasing inflammation markers, and gut microbiome disruption aren't disconnected from these shifts in how we eat.\n \nPerhaps the true innovation we need isn't faster delivery, but technology that helps us reclaim our connection to food, balancing convenience with the timeless wisdom of traditional nourishment.\n\nHow have you found ways to balance modern convenience with traditional food wisdom?\n\n#QuickCommerce #Technology #Innovation",

His philosophy of nonviolent resistance transformed India's freedom struggle through consistent action despite uncertainty. Had he waited for the \"perfect moment,\" history would have unfolded very differently.\n\nThis wisdom is crucial for entrepreneurs. Many hesitate, waiting for the “right” market conditions, the “perfect” product, or the \"safe\" moment to launch. But as Gandhi’s words remind us, inaction leads to nothing.\n\nTake Upasana Taku, co-founder of MobiKwik, who could have remained in her high paying job in the Silicon Valley. Instead, she bet on India's digital payments future. Today, Mobikwik stands as a fintech leader—all because she chose action over hesitation.\n\nFor founders navigating uncertainty:\n\n▶️ Start before you feel ready—momentum matters more than perfection\n▶️ Small actions compound into significant outcomes\n▶️ The only true failure is inaction\n▶️ Embrace challenges as growth opportunities\n▶️ Launch and iterate rather than waiting for perfect conditions\n\nYour startup won't build itself. Results may not be immediate, but taking that first step creates possibilities that inaction never will.\n\nWhat concrete action will you take today toward your dream? I'd love to hear in the comments.\n\n#Leadership #MondayMotivation #Growth",

It’s not just about physical fitness - it’s about emotional connection, accountability, and a sense of tribe.\n\nTake cult fit it's not just about the workouts - it’s about the community. When you walk into a Cult studio, you’re not just entering a gym. You’re stepping into a space where people show up for more than their personal goals - they show up for each other.\n\nWe’ve all been there - too tired to work out, but then you remember your friends are counting on you. That shared responsibility can be incredibly motivating. Like in a startup when everyone feels the weight of collective ownership. Group fitness taps into human instinct - the need to belong to something bigger than ourselves.\n\nTake pickleball. It’s blown up across India as a social sport, blending fun and fitness. People are booking out courts months in advance!\n\nWe recently started the KFit initiative in Kalaari to encourage physical wellbeing. Where one day in a month is dedicated towards some fitness activity encouraging every team member to be healthy and fit. \n\nIf we could make more of sports and fitness be the future of socializing, we will create a better society for all. Breaking a sweat together, celebrating small wins, and growing as individuals within a tribe might be more a healthier way forward, it can be emotionally nurturing for a stronger community and bonds that allow you to lean on!\n\n#Sports #Fitness #Startup",

Each show is a curation of artistry, the culmination of the efforts of extraordinary artists from all over the world.\n\nI watched my first show in 1992. I was hooked on the sheer audacity and entrepreneurship it must have taken to disrupt the traditional circus as we knew it and create a new entertainment genre, that too profitably, bringing employment to many and joy to the viewers. \n\nThis is Bangaly Sylla, performing an astonishing, precision, and gravity-defying, awe-inspiring move.\n\nWhen I saw this, I was mesmerized. What makes this possible for a human being? I wondered. The agility required is mind-boggling. \n\nBangaly is from Guinea and has honed his acrobatic craft over the years. What made him think of pushing his body to these limits? It looks so smooth, but requires relentless hours of training to reach this level of perfection.\n\nThis performance led me to ponder: What drives individuals to pursue such feats of excellence? \n\nThese endeavors often lack direct practical application, yet they captivate us because they push the boundaries of human potential and the limits of our bodies and make us believe that, for a moment, anything is possible. Bangaly is not alone. We have climber Alex Honnold, who shot to fame by climbing the sheer rock face of El Capitan in Yosemite without any support. One slip, and certain death awaited him. \n\nOr take the Marathon des Sables, considered the most gruelling marathon in the world. It is about 250 km in the hot Saharan desert. Marathoners must carry their supplies for nearly a week of running, and their feet are bloodied, blistered, and bruised. \n\nHowever, ultimately, some merge triumphant. Tightrope walker Philippe Petit walked between the Twin Towers in 1974 with no harness or backup.\n\nWhat motivates us to challenge ourselves to extremes? Is it wired into human existence, a relentless drive to surpass thresholds? \n\nSome people are wired differently; they reach for something deep within, leave fear behind, and focus only on their goal. That goal may make no sense in the larger scheme. But it matters for the human spirit because it tells us that the impossible is in the mind until proven as possible.\n\nWhat’s the last thing you saw that made you stop and say, how is this even possible?\n\n#Innovation #Leadership #Entrepreneurship",

    "Vani Kola's post 2mo ago": "When people ask me about success, I often hesitate to answer. I don’t think of myself as successful. Well, at least, not in the way it's commonly defined. \n\nWhich made me wonder: Where did this word even come from? Success originates from the Latin \"successus,\" meaning an outcome or a result. In Middle English (14th-15th century), it was used to mean a good or bad outcome, not necessarily an achievement. It wasn’t until the 16th century that success became tied to favourable outcomes alone.\n\nAnd isn't that interesting?\n\nFor much of human history, life was measured not in terms of achievements but in terms of survival. Early humans didn't consider whether they were successful. They hunted, gathered, and built shelter for their families. A day with food was a good day. A day without? Well, they adapted. \n\nSuccess, as we use it today, feels absolute. It is a final state, a label. We use it to describe our lives. But can life really be defined as successful or failed?\n\nYou can finish a project. Close a deal, make millions. Complete a marathon. And yes, you can call that a successful outcome. But life isn’t a finality. It’s a process. Yet, we treat success as something to reach and hold onto permanently.\n\nMaybe that’s the real challenge. We’ve turned success into an external benchmark when in reality, it is fluid, personal, and ever-evolving. When you give that absoluteness to success, you are doing yourself a disservice. \n\nSo, instead of asking, “Am I successful?” perhaps the better question is:\n\nAm I growing? Am I learning? Am I moving forward?\n\nSo when I am asked, how does it feel to be successful, I don't know really. Each day, I work on aiming for grateful versus successful.\n\n#Success #Leadership #Innovation",

To Chandrasekhar, they were good students.\n\nThey deserved a teacher.\n\nThe result?\n\nYears later, both students won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nAnd Chandrasekhar himself won the 1983 Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on black holes.\n\nBut this story is more than a lesson in teaching. \n\nIt’s a reminder that no breakthrough happens alone. \n\nThe two students benefited from Chandrasekhar. \n\nAnd Chandrasekhar? \n\nHis own journey was built on the shoulders of giants. \n\nHis uncle was Sir C.V.

Like many great ideas, the concept was initially ridiculed. \n\nToday, black holes are proven to exist.\n\nEvery idea, innovation, and risk we take is built on something before us. \n\nChandrasekhar taught two students who later won Nobel Prizes. \n\nJust as the students learned from him, he built on ideas from centuries ago.\n\nNone of us are lone warriors.\n\nAnd none of us can see into the future.

Elsewhere, someone takes their last.\n\nSometimes, a second is all it takes to make a decision — like buying those expensive shoes in your cart — to shrink your monthly budget! \n\nBut, have you ever stopped to think: what is a second?\n\nIt feels philosophical, but the history of timekeeping is more than a construct. It’s physics and it’s very, very precise. \n\nCenturies ago, time was understood by nature unfolding. Sundials marked hours with shadows, and water clocks dripped their way through the night. Clock towers guided people in the town, symbolising a revolution in how we see and read time. \n\nThen came mechanical watches, digital clocks, and, eventually, the annoying microwave timer. \n\nHowever, it wasn’t until the late 20th century that scientists began to ask: just how small can we make time? \n\nThe answer lies in the caesium-133 atom. \n\nThis soft, silvery-gold metal is the source of measuring modern time.\n\nScientists discovered that caesium atoms naturally oscillate at an astonishingly consistent rate: 9,192,631,770 cycles per second – making it a reliable measure of a second.\n\nBy the 1960s, this discovery led to atomic clocks, now our modern world's heroes. From guiding GPS to keeping financial markets in sync, atomic clocks are the foundation of timekeeping today. \n\nThe story doesn’t stop here. \n\nScientists are now building new atomic clocks, called optical lattice clocks, that measure time by counting light waves!\n\nThese clocks are 100 times more accurate than the ones we use today. \n\nThey’re so precise they can sense tiny changes in time caused by gravity, even with just a one-centimeter difference in height.\n\nIt’s so precise that it’s redefining what a second even means! \n\nSo, as time ticks on, the question isn’t just how accurately we measure a second — it’s what we do with time. \n\nAfter all, a second could be the moment everything changes. \n\nHow do you set value to your time?\n\n#science #future #physics #time",

It is about the values and actions that suited the occasion thrust upon the leader. \n\nA leader who guided brilliantly in one situation may fail miserably in another. \n\nSo it is a person, a situation, and the choices that created outcomes we respect that create the opportunity to tell the leadership story.\n\nHowever, I think there are some core commonalities we can derive.\n\nA recent study revealed that:\n\n▶ Boomers value loyalty\n▶ Gen X thrives on independence\n▶ Millennials prioritize purpose\n▶ Gen Z demands authenticity\n\nAnd this too is a product of the time and circumstances that defined their “purpose and meaning.”\n\nWhen Brian Thompson, ex CEO of United Health, was gunned down in broad daylight, I was horrified. I saw a man doing his job—perhaps a good son, father, husband—living in a civil society that would frown on murder and vigilante rights to take another person’s life. Yet, Luigi Mangione is a genuine hero to many. \n\nEvery parent is familiar with the value gap they experience in raising children into adults. Yet, our boundless love forces a quest to nurture the relationship, and hence we embark on learning their perspective and finding bridges to co-exist and thrive.\n\nLeadership, at its core, is the art of understanding people and their needs and offering a bridge to collective outcomes that may otherwise be unachievable. \n\nThe more diverse the group—in age, culture, and values—the harder meshing this together gets. \n\nAnd today’s workforce is more and more diverse, global, and non-homogeneous.\n\nI realized it’s not just about managing these differences but leveraging them. For instance, pairing a creative Gen Z team member with a strategic Gen X mentor can blend fresh ideas with practical, actionable plans.\n\nWhat intrigues me even more is the future. With technology accelerating at breakneck speed, will the next generation prioritize something we can’t even predict yet? Will AI and automation redefine values like creativity or connection?\n\nOne thing is certain: a one-size-fits-all approach no longer works—our workplaces need to adapt and embrace individuality. Remember, when each person feels valued and empowered, the entire team wins.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you’ve done to make your workplace a better space for everyone?\n\n#leadership #futureofwork #management",

The thoughtful insights from successful leaders, guided silence, collaborative group discussions, meditation sessions, and amazing music were a reminder that our greatest innovations often emerge from moments of profound stillness and authentic interactions.\n\nThe most valuable venture capital is the investment we make in our inner development.

As we rush through our daily lives, we often wonder: if we had more time, would life feel more meaningful?\n\nI've been reflecting on the meaning of time.\n\nRemember when we used to stand in long queues at banks? We chatted with strangers, swapping stories, sharing frustrations, forming fleeting connections.\n\nOr when grocery shopping meant dedicating half a day? I often went with my father, swinging the bags as he kept me entertained with stories. Sometimes, if I were lucky, he’d buy me an éclair—an indulgence that I’d cherish all the way home.\n\nAnd what about the hours spent in libraries, thumbing through books, searching for information? I usually had a friend along, and in between, we’d chat about everything and nothing. Some of those friendships still hold strong today.\n\nWere we wasting time, or were we creating memories?\n\nToday, modernization has given us speed and convenience. \n\nBank queues are gone, replaced by a few taps on an app. Groceries are delivered in minutes. Information is at our fingertips. \n\nTechnology is supposed to be giving us back time. \n\nMore moments with family. Leisurely Sunday afternoons reclaimed from endless errands.\n\nAnd yet—what are we doing with this reclaimed time?\n\nWe were supposed to be freed from the mundane, yet we find ourselves trapped in mindless scrolling. Instead of more time with people, we spend more time with screens.\n\nI often wonder—if we had all the time in the world and no work, would we be happier? Or would we feel lost?\n\nSo, I’m curious—how are you choosing to spend the time that technology has given back to you?\n\n#Motivation #Time #PersonalDevelopment",

Do you still worry that your voice isn't equally heard? Do you look back at generations of women before you, drawing inspiration from their struggles to pave your fearless path?\n\nI am 61 years old, and I feel fulfilled with the life I've led. I count myself among the fortunate ones—yet it was rarely an easy journey. I've had to value every opportunity and continuously prove I was capable and worthy. \n\nIn my 20s, I naively assumed the coming decades would make life far easier for women than today's reality. While some parts of the world have become more equitable, there are places where women have tragically regressed, denied even basic education rights.\n\nI hold onto hope each day that those of us with positive support and opportunities can create meaningful change. Though our progress may feel ordinary, we are quietly shaping a new world for the future you.\n\n\"यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः\"\n (Where women are honored, there the gods are pleased)\n\nThis wisdom comes from our ancient texts. Perhaps women in the distant past did have better rights and were truly valued. Somewhere along the line, we entered dark ages for women and now we stand in the shadow of that history, emerging slowly into light.\n\nAs you gaze into what I hope is your bright future, remember to know your history. Unless you guard and cherish these hard-fought choices, darkness can descend, creeping in unnoticed until it's too late to fight back.\n\nYour typical day might not feel miraculous now, but tomorrow, if the freedoms we take for granted are denied, you'll need extraordinary vigilance and resilience. Even today, in some of the world's most advanced regions, we're told that equality and bodily autonomy cannot be ours.\n\nShow up for yourself and for the women you will one day write to—not because it's easy, but because it matters that we make the world a little better every day. Every door you walk through becomes easier to open for the woman behind you. Every table you sit at becomes less lonely for the next woman who takes a seat.\n\n\"विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद् याति पात्रताम्\"\n (Knowledge gives humility, from humility comes worthiness)\n\nTo you, the women of tomorrow: The loudest voices will tell you who you ought to be, but the wisest voice, your own, already knows who you are. \n\nListen to that voice. Cherish it. Trust it. Amplify it. Fight for it if you must but always protect your right to be heard and to be who you want to be.\n\nWith fierce hope and unwavering faith, I believe in you.\n\nVani Kola\n\n#WomensDay #IWD2025 #Leadership",

I know how fortunate I am with my network of support, because I would be but a fraction without them. \n\nThe incredible women who give me the ability to fully focus on my work and my family by taking on some of my responsibilities deserve more than mere thanks. \n\nA friend offering perspective when I'm overwhelmed, a family member stepping in during emergencies, work colleagues anticipating challenges before they arise, my mother, whose wisdom continues to guide me even now. They all play different roles that collectively make my journey possible. \n\nThey say behind every successful man stands a woman, but I've learned that behind every successful woman is an entire army that enables her to work, dream, live, and take on challenges.\n\nTheir dedication and trust are something that no employment contract could ever mandate or measure.\n\nWhile my support circle is strongly women, men are an integral part of it too, and without that balance, I wouldn't experience the full spectrum of perspectives that enrich my decisions.\n\nWhat strikes me most about all of you, whether at work or home, is how you anticipate my needs, physical or emotional, and make that a priority as a choice. The hot chai that appears just when I need it, and fills my heart with gratitude. The extra distance you go to create that PPT or gather the data I have not asked for, to make my talk go smoothly. Even if some of my support is paid for their services, extraordinary care is a result of genuine regard and respect, never a transactional obligation. \n\nYou are the unsung heroes of my story. And I celebrate each one of you. \n\n#Management #Leadership #Innovation",

And stories of women’s achievements and leaps were often hidden in layers of unspoken history.\n\nI find myself revisiting the stories I’ve shared last year. Stories about extraordinary women in India who have made remarkable contributions in leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship. \n\nThroughout the year, I’ve written about these women — one post at a time — sharing glimpses of their journeys. The more I did, the more it struck me: these are the stories that have created the present, the opportunities we have. \n\nThe “Unsung Heroes.” \n\nTheir work is rarely spotlighted.

That’s when you can have that inner glow of having done well in life.\n\nTake the story of Sam McCracken, the driving force behind Nike N7. By channeling resources into supporting Native American youth, McCracken quietly built a platform that has empowered over 500,000 young people. It wasn't about personal credit; it was about creating opportunities that transform lives.\n\nFor me, those moments matter. It’s not about applause or acknowledgement. \n\nIt’s about knowing that my work mattered, that it has helped others move forward.\n\nWe never know how our work may shape the world. \n\nWhen Gutenberg invented the printing press, at great financial duress and social ostracization, he may not have realised how much it would change the world forever. Without the printed word, the world would still be in the dark ages and books are a luxury only kings and the very wealthy could afford. \n\nThe quiet proof that doing the work, and doing it well, creates value.\n\nLet your work carry the weight of your ambition. \n\nLet it speak louder than anything you could say. \n\nThe rest will follow.\n\n#motivation #career #leadership",

While retailers initially resisted, preferring loose oil, Mariwala changed the industry by introducing tamper-proof blue bottles. \n\nThis not only addressed concerns about adulteration but also ensured convenience for the modern consumer. \n\nIn a clever marketing twist, Mariwala even proved the durability of Parachute's new plastic packaging by using rats in a live test, demonstrating how the oil bottles resisted damage.\n\nThrough consistent quality, a robust distribution network, and strategic advertising, Parachute has grown into a household name, with over 50% market share in today’s Indian branded coconut oil market. \n\nThe concept behind the name is also something I found interesting. \n\nDuring World War II, Indians first witnessed the use of parachutes, amazed by how they ensured a safe landing for army men. And soon they became synonymous with safety, security, and reliability.\n\nHence, the name ‘parachute’!\n\nIn a world of change, the power of brand endures. \n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴. \n\nAdvise me on your favourite enduring 𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥s :)\n\nImage source: Mint\n\n#marketing #branding #india",

And it’s an important question—what really is in a name? \n\nWe are given this identity the moment we are born. We all have a 𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞.\n\nI recently came across this video. \n\nIn the hills of Meghalaya, there’s a village where names aren’t spoken—they're sung. 🎵\n\nThis is 𝐊𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐠, India’s \"𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐕𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐞\", where every resident has a unique melody instead of a name. This beautiful tradition, called Jingrwai Iawbei, has been passed down through generations, blending identity and music in an almost magical way.\n\nA shorter version is a nickname, while the full tune can last up to a minute. The villagers' creativity and strong bond with nature are evident in the fact that no two songs are ever the same. \n\nIt reminds me of The Sound of Music. Remember the scene where Captain Von Trapp whistles and the children come running? I was fascinated by that moment when I first watched the movie.\n\nThis got me thinking: When did humans start naming each other? The earliest recorded name is Kushim, written on a clay tablet in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago. Over time, naming conventions evolved, including first names, last names, and surnames tied to occupations, locations, or even physical traits. Names help us identify each other, build communities, and keep track of individuals within larger groups.\n\nNature has long used sound for identification. Elephants recognize herd members through calls, birds attract mates with unique songs, and whales have sounds that convey information to the rest of the pod.\n\nIn an increasingly connected world, preserving unique traditions like this reminds us of the diverse ways humans have built identity, connection, and community.\n\nIf your name were a melody, what would it sound like?\n\nVideo Source: Massimo, finding.neha (Twitter)\n\n#India #culture #history",

𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐲𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐚 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐁𝐨𝐬𝐞 \n\nBorn in Kolkata, his early life was marked by a deep passion for science. He excelled in his studies and eventually became a professor at the University of Dhaka. It was during this time that he made his most significant contribution to physics.\n\nIn 1924, Dr. Bose, then a professor at the University of Dhaka, penned a paper that challenged the established ideas of classical physics.\n\nHe developed a new way of understanding particles- particles that didn’t follow the conventional rules. \n\nHis paper, which focused on photon statistics, was initially rejected by a major journal, but Bose didn’t give up. \n\nHe sent it directly to Albert Einstein, who not only saw its brilliance but translated it into German and had it published in a prestigious journal.\n\n Thus, Bose-Einstein statistics were born, a method that explained how particles can behave in ways that classical physics could not predict.\n\nLater, his paper on quantum statistics led to the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensates decades later- an entirely new state of matter that was only experimentally observed in the 1990s. \n\nAnd today? His work continues to be fundamental in fields like quantum computing and superconductivity!\n\nHowever, what truly sets Bose apart is his quiet humility. Unlike many of his peers, Bose didn’t chase fame or international acclaim.\n\nDespite multiple Nobel Prize nominations, he never received one, but that didn’t seem to bother him. He remained committed to his work and to India, where he continued teaching and inspiring students. \n\nHe made significant contributions to X-ray crystallography, unified field theory, and science education in local languages.\n\nWhen the Higgs Boson particle was finally discovered in 2012, it grabbed global headlines. \n\nBut it’s important to remember that “Boson” is a tribute to Dr. Bose- without his early contributions to quantum statistics, our understanding of these particles wouldn’t exist.\n\nThough his name may not be as widely known outside scientific circles, his contributions continue to shape the very foundation of modern physics.\n\nAt the end of the day, Dr. Bose's work may be rooted in the complexities of quantum mechanics, but his legacy transcends it- he is a true pioneer, a scientist whose vision will continue to influence the future of physics for generations to come.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘜𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘏𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢’𝘴 𝘚𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐𝘯𝘯𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.\n\n#science #india #physics",

    "Vani Kola's post 3mo ago": "Your routine on a typical day doesn't feel like a miracle. :)\n\nBut tomorrow, when your health is impacted and the typical day gets challenging—recovery to do the mundane is the miracle you pray for.\n\nI mostly take my health and high energy for granted. I wake up, do my thing, and power through the day. \n\nA little over a month ago, I injured my knee. \n\nInitially, it wasn’t a big deal—a minor soreness, nothing dramatic. I thought a day or two of rest would fix it, and I'd return to normal in no time.\n\nI’ve always thought of myself as invincible when it comes to powering through challenges. But, I’ve discovered that I’m not quite as unstoppable as I believed.\n\n“Wow, my knees are really killing it today!” That is just a phrase—until it wasn't. \n\nI’d trade for the regular, pain-free days I didn’t pause to appreciate. A miracle is often just an everyday thing that we might overlook and not appreciate enough.\n\n👉 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗮𝗹 (𝗔𝗞𝗔 𝗠𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗯𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗻𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻)\n\nI took a short break, got impatient, jumped back into my usual activities, and the pain came right back. \n\nThis started a cycle: pain, rest, a short recovery, return to normal...and then pain again. \n\nEventually, it was no longer just an annoying ache; it escalated into a full-blown meniscus tear. \n\nJust like that, my \"walk it off\" strategy left me with a walker and, at times, a wheelchair, forcing me to slow down whether I wanted to or not (spoiler: I didn’t).\n\n👉 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗿 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗽𝗶𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘆? (𝗔 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲, 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆)\n\nI’ve always been the type to push myself—set goals, power through discomfort, and refuse to quit halfway. That mindset has served me well in many situations, but in this case, it became a liability. \n\nI ignored every warning sign my body was screaming at me because I hoped that pushing through the pain would make it go away. It turns out that sometimes, strength means knowing when to slow down.\n\nAs the saying goes, our greatest strengths can also be our Achilles’ heel. Pushing through an injury isn’t resilience; it’s just... not smart.\n\n👉 𝗔 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗶𝘀𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗜 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱’𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗦𝗼𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗿)\n\nHustle culture says to \"grind\" and \"never quit.\" But nobody discusses when pausing is the better choice. \n\nWe must reframe strength—sometimes, choosing to pause takes more courage than pushing ahead.\n\nThis injury, as frustrating as it was, I consider it a gift. \n\nIt forced me to reflect, listen to my body, and appreciate the simple things—like walking pain-free, which is a luxury I will never take for granted again.\n\nTrue strength is knowing when to stop and making the choice to heal.\n \nResilience isn’t just about pushing forward—it’s about knowing when to pause, reassess, and make choices that serve us in the long run. \n\n #personaldevelopment #life #health #fitness",

A woman who challenged colonial rule and used the power of language to move a nation.\n\nShe earned the title “𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮” because her words had the rare ability to stir souls.\n\nAnd today, on her birth anniversary, I wanted to share one of my favorite poems by her:\n\n𝑻𝒐 𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒊𝒂\n“𝘖 𝘠𝘖𝘜𝘕𝘎 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘺 𝘪𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴!\n𝘙𝘪𝘴𝘦, 𝘔𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳, 𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘦, 𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘺 𝘨𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘮,\n𝘈𝘯𝘥, 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘢 𝘣𝘳𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘩-𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘴,\n𝘉𝘦𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘨𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘸𝘰𝘮𝘣!\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘯 𝘧𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘱\n𝘊𝘳𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬 . . . .\n𝘔𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳, 𝘖 𝘔𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳, 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘥𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶 𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘦𝘱?\n𝘈𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘺 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘯'𝘴 𝘴𝘢𝘬𝘦!\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘺 𝘍𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘢 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘧𝘰𝘭𝘥 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥\n𝘛𝘰 𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴, 𝘴𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴, 𝘷𝘪𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘷𝘢𝘴𝘵;\n𝘞𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘯, 𝘖 𝘴𝘭𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘔𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘣𝘦 𝘤𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘦𝘥,\n𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘰𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘵 𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘪𝘨𝘯 𝘗𝘢𝘴𝘵.”\n\nThis poem, like much of her work, was a call to action. \n\nHer collection \"The Golden Threshold\" proves her ability to weave beauty and rebellion into the same lines. And she was just 26 years old when this text was published!\n\nShe fought for a nation’s freedom while advocating for women’s rights in a deeply patriarchal world. And she did it with resilience, grace, and an unshakable belief that words can change the world.\n\nSo today, on her birth anniversary, it’s worth revisiting her words.\n\nIs it worth listening to voices from the past that still have the power to guide us today?\n\n#India #whatinspiresme #womenleaders",

    "Vani Kola's post 3mo ago": "When I first read about the Galapagos Islands in my childhood, I was completely fascinated by a place with no predators — leading to birds that never learned to fly, and those massive lizards called iguanas.\n\nSometimes, you read something that blows your imagination beyond anything you had ever thought. \n\n'𝑶𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑶𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒊𝒏 𝒐𝒇 𝑺𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒔' by Charles Darwin was that book. \n\nSo, Galapagos was definitely on the bucket list at a time when I had never traveled beyond my hometown! And finally, I visited the Galapagos in 2003. \n\nThere, I saw firsthand what Darwin saw in 1835 — species that had adapted in extraordinary ways to survive. \n\nFor example, birds like the Blue-Footed Booby, which barely flies. Why? Because they’ve never had natural predators.\n\nThat moment made Darwin’s ideas more real to me: Evolution is about adoption. \n\nDarwin wasn’t the first to suggest that life didn’t originate from some divine force. \n\nBut his timing was right. A few decades earlier, his ideas might have gotten him killed. A few decades later, they might have been dismissed as obvious. Every idea needs its time and its audience.\n\nThat’s true for science. It’s true for innovation. And it’s true for social progress. \n\nAnd undoubtedly true for startups.\n\nDarwin’s theory changed how we think about competition, resilience, and adaptation.\n\n➡️Businesses that fail to adapt go extinct. \n➡️Leaders who resist change stagnate. \n➡️Societies that close themselves off to new ideas fall behind.\n\nNokia and BlackBerry once dominated mobile phones- until they didn’t. Blockbuster could have been on top of streaming but refused to evolve and was replaced by Netflix. Companies, industries, and even entire civilizations have crumbled because they believed they were immune to change.\n\nThe first step toward evolution—whether in science or life—is having an open mind. \n\nHowever, history has shown that open minds don’t happen by accident. They need to be nurtured.\n\nEven today, education is restricted in many parts of the world, especially for women. Certain ideas and people are suppressed. Without the right conditions, the best theories and possibilities for the future may never take root.\n\nToday, February 12, is marked as Darwin’s Day. It is a day to remember that true evolution means ensuring that our minds and societies remain open to change.\n\nBecause history shows us that those who don’t adapt don't matter in the timespan of the universe.\n\nIf you read ‘On the Origin of Species,’ What thoughts stuck with you and cascaded into deep reflections?\n\n#reflections #evolution #science #startups",

Can 'calm' be cultivated?\n\nYesterday at The Festival of Joy, hosted by INKtalks  and YourDOST  I had the privilege of sharing my thoughts on “Joy” and making meditation a habit that has fundamentally transformed my life. Thank you Lakshmi Pratury for inviting me and letting me share my story.\n\nI remember when meditation felt like an impossible activity. As a young mother, running a startup, juggling family life — the mere suggestion of sitting still or finding self-time seemed absurd.\n\nBut here's the thing: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗺 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗹𝘀𝗲 𝗶n life falls in place.\n\nA calm mind isn't just nice to have - it's your daily survival toolkit.\n\nHere's what I've learned:\n\n▶️ Joy isn't complicated - it's simply gratitude in action\n\n▶️ The perfect time to start isn't tomorrow - it's now\n\n▶️ Your thoughts won't stop - but your reaction to them can change\n\n▶️ Struggles of life don’t vanish – but your courage to face them can\n\nStudies show meditation reduces stress, improves focus, and enhances emotional well-being.\n\nBut here's the real question: 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘂𝘀?\n\nMaybe it's fear. Maybe it's doubt. Or maybe we're just too comfortable in our chaos.\n\nHere’s a question worth asking yourself today:\n\nWhat does Joy mean to me?\n\n#meditation #mindfulness #personaldevelopment",

How would it change how you live today?\n\nI remember this telemarketing call I received in my early twenties. \n\nI had just moved to the US. They were selling funeral insurance! \n\nI had never even heard such a thing or even thought about it. I was obviously the wrong target group, but that isn't the point. \n\nI was unnerved the whole day by the concept of someone asking me if I was adequately prepared to protect my loved ones from hassles if I died! \n\nPerhaps 20’s is not the right time to contemplate this, but we must consider this question at some point in our life.\n\nIt’s a question that has haunted humanity for as long as we’ve understood our mortality. \n\nThis is the unsettling premise behind apps like Death Clock. At first glance, they seem morbid — predicting the date of your death. But dig deeper, it aims to be a reminder of how fragile life is and how much intention matters.\n\nI’ll admit, the idea is unnerving.\n\nHere’s the thing: 𝗡𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗹𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝗲. But what it can do is offer a wake-up call:\n\n▶️ What if we lived with more clarity, purpose, and gratitude? \n▶️ What if we stopped postponing the things that truly matter?\n\nScience backs this up. A Harvard University study found that gratitude alone can lower mortality risk.\n\nBut here’s the real question: 𝗜𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹?\n\nFor some, relying on AI for such personal insights feels invasive or manipulative. But maybe the accuracy isn’t the point. This app has over 125,000 downloads already.\n\nMaybe these tools start uncomfortable conversations and make us see painful truths.\n\nIt makes us think if we have been living the life we want, or if we are nurturing the relationships that matter.\n\nSo, I’ll leave you with this: Will we make different lifestyle choices if we knew our ‘𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲’? \n\n#ai #technology #innovation",

But sometimes when I can't focus, I use the Heartfulness Institute app as a companion to meditate.\n\nIt’s a completely free app, and I use it for guided meditation to start my day with clarity. I was actively involved in its PRD (product requirements document). I hadn’t done hands-on product management in a while, but it was a good feeling to get into the product development cycle.\n\nThe app also offers an evening \"cleaning\" practice to declutter the mind. \n\nToday, the Heartfulness app has over 1M downloads. It is also the only app to support 11 languages including French and Ukrainian. :) \n\nThe rise of mindfulness apps reflects a deep societal shift. \n\nWe are all collectively yearning for peace and solitude amid an increasingly digital, hyperconnected, overstimulated, and demanding life. \n\nThe numbers tell the story:\n\n➡️ The global mindfulness app market, valued at $522 million in 2022, is projected to soar to $7.59 billion by 2031, with a CAGR of 34.9%.\n➡️ In 2023 alone, global revenues from mobile meditation and mental wellness apps hit approximately $14 billion.\n➡️ India, too, is riding this wave, with rising mental health awareness and smartphone penetration driving adoption.\n\nThese apps have made mindfulness accessible, portable, and customisable. \n\nThey also remind us of the importance of disconnecting.\n\nBalancing their use with offline moments of mindfulness is the key to healthier well-being.\n\nHow do you meditate? And if you don’t, what is holding you back? \n\nAnd if you have some time, please download the Heartfulness Institute app and share feedback on what we can do to improve. The app has been developed and offered free due to volunteer efforts. 🙂\n\n#heartfulness #mindfulness #meditation",

It is automation — smarter devices that simplify life.\n\n✅ Apple’s Intelligence anticipates our needs\n✅ Microsoft’s Recall resurfaces forgotten tasks\n✅ Google’s AI tools make life easier\n✅ Amazon's Alexa knows your favorite unwind playlist\n\nBut these features rely on a constant stream of data – our emails, messages, photos, voice commands — a complete record of our lives.\n\nThese are processed through advanced encryption, or in the cloud. But once your data is logged, the question remains: is it truly secure?\n\nThis isn't a new concern. \n\nThe erosion of privacy didn’t start with AI. Google was a game-changer in the way it normalized data collection for targeted advertising. \n\nWith the rise of Alexa, Siri, and other AI assistants, privacy concerns only grew. Now, AI tools leave little room for anonymity.\n\nAnd today, scrutiny is increasing.\n\nFew days ago, EU officially started enforcing its landmark Artificial Intelligence (AI) law i.e. EU AI Act. It’s the world’s most comprehensive AI regulation, which prohibits certain AI applications — like social scoring systems, or real-time facial recognition — due to privacy risks.\n\nSo, I often wonder: what would our society look like a few years from now?\n\nWould our lives be lived out in the open, fully transparent? Will free will be reduced to an illusion as AI pushes us into decisions tailored by algorithms? Will privacy become an old thought of the past?\n\nThe need for transparency in exploiting our data has never been greater. \n\nMany AI systems, especially AI-powered search tools, don’t give clear options on whether you’d like to share your data. There’s often no clear way to opt in or out, which means people can end up handing over personal information without realizing it\n\nThe bigger question, though, is about choice. \n\nAs a society, are we consciously choosing convenience over privacy? And if we are, is that the future we really want?\n\nOur lives are increasingly out in the open, and I can’t help but ask: Are we truly in control, or are we being shaped by the very tools we designed to serve us?\n\nImage: Intelligence Briefing\n\n#data #ai #technology",

    "🏉 Pascal Bouvier's post 3yr ago": "in the past year i have encountered a handful of startups raising an equity round where the ceo/founder did not plan, wanted or believed in the benefits of a proper board.\n\nthey viewed a board solely as a net/net negative that would slow them down. they did not understand the benefits nor did they understand the associated risks of not having a proper governance.\n\nfurther, i was told by these founders that the other investors willing to invest (these were funds, but not necessarily traditional venture funds) did not require proper governance and boards.\n\ni know of at least 3 startups, that for this description, which ended up closing a round. \n\ngiven market exuberance, these rounds were closed at relatively high valuations with high amounts raised.\n\nall between post seed and pre A rounds.\n\nalthough i am perfectly willing to concede that a founder and founding team can be successful without proper governance, i do believe such path leads to higher risks and unintended consequences.\n\nadditionally, and this might be anecdotal, in all cases, while performing due diligence on these startups i found out that the other investors were not even bothering interviewing the entire teams. for such early stage investments that surprised me.\n\ni can only imagine the type of shareholder agreement and investor rights needed when no board is considered. or maybe those investors do not even bother about that, which makes me question their sanity.\n\none founder even told me that by asking for a board I showed him I did not trust him enough, compared to other investors who did not require one. that left me speechless indeed. \n\ni have come up with 2 explanations first, given the amount of capital available and the proliferation of new funds in the market, founders can entertain offers from investors with risk profiles markedly divergent from traditional norms.\n\nsecond, investments in crypto protocols have shown one can raise money in a non traditional way. this might indirectly impact traditional equity raises? \n\ni am opened to other explanations.",

So what would work?\nIn today's New York Times, I looked at the steps that policymakers could take to prevent a #coronavirus-driven recession. One big lesson from the last crisis: Act aggressively, and act now. \nSo far, at least, the Trump administration doesn’t seem to be heeding that advice. Mr. Trump is weighing a temporary elimination of the payroll tax, a measure with a big dollar figure (it could cost nearly $700 billion) but that would provide only a trickle of extra cash into workers’ bank accounts. For people who lose their jobs as a result of the outbreak, a payroll tax cut wouldn’t help at all.\nTo learn more about what might work, see my story in today's Times:\n#recession #economy #covid19",

In fact, investment has fallen this year, and a New York Times analysis of securities filings from the S&P500 found no relationship between the size of a company’s tax cut and the investments they made. If anything, the companies that received the biggest tax cuts increased their capital investment by less, on average, than companies that got smaller cuts.\nFew companies were more vocal in their advocacy for the tax bill than FedEx. The company’s CEO, Fred Smith, hit the airwaves and op-ed pages promoting the benefits of lower corporate taxes. For FedEx, it paid off — the company cut its tax bill to zero in the 2018 fiscal year. But it invested less than it projected before the bill passed, even as it increased dividends and buybacks. \nFor more on our analysis, including FedEx’s response, see my story with Jim Tankersley and Peter Eavis in The New York Times:",

I met a software engineer who had taken two years off when she had children, then struggled to get back to work -- until Dell hired her through a new \"Career Restart\" program. And I stopped by Austin Community College, where employers were practically fighting over themselves to hire students -- and were willing to overlook barriers like inexperience or criminal records that might have been an issue in past years.\nThere's been lots of talk recently (from me, among others) about whether the U.S. economy is headed for a recession. But it's worth remembering why it's so important to keep the expansion going as long as possible: The strong job market is creating opportunities for people who were left behind early in the recovery.\nFor more, see my story in today's New York Times.\n#economy #recession #jobs #disability #hiring",

(The new numbers are preliminary, and are part of a regular annual revision process.)\nAs I wrote in today's New York Times, the revision doesn't change the big picture: The labor market is in good shape. But 500,000 jobs is a lot of jobs! Certainly enough to deserve attention. And it's the latest evidence that the economy might not have been as strong last year as we thought -- which is significant, because the economy has slowed further since then.\nPlus, as LinkedIn Chief Economist Guy Berger, Ph.D. told me, big data revisions can be a sign that the economy is at a turning point -- a troubling thought given the other economic warning signs out there right now.

There's a big partisan split -- Democrats and independents oppose the tariffs by a wide margin, while Republicans overwhelmingly support the president's approach. But even most Republicans think the trade war will raise prices.\n\nWill any of this matter in 2020? Hard to say. Trade doesn't generally rank high on voters' lists of top issues.

But after the housing bubble burst, big institutional investors swooped in to buy up millions of houses for pennies on the dollar. And to almost everyone's surprise, they've kept buying even as prices have rebounded. One in five starter homes sold in the U.S. last year were bought by investors. In some markets, it was closer to half.\nAll those investors mean more competition for ordinary buyers, at a time when affordability is already a huge challenge in many cities. But it's a complicated story -- investors are also helping to rehab homes that were abandoned in the foreclosure crisis.\nIn today's The New York Times, Conor Dougherty and I explore this trend through one home in Atlanta, which was sold three times in less than a year -- and nearly quadrupled in price.

If you don't, you could find yourself in even worse shape next year. https://lnkd.in/du5ktai\n\nMeanwhile, don't make the mistake of thinking that your tax refund tells you anything about whether you got a tax cut last year. Spoiler alert: You probably did. Or at least it's unlikely you got a tax increase, even if you live in a high-tax state like New York or California. Don't believe me?

But it's not falling off a cliff.\n\nThat might sound like damning with faint praise. But after a disastrous retail sales report earlier this month, there were a lot of economists who thought growth fell below 2 percent at the end of the year. Compared to that, 2.6 percent looks pretty good.\n\nThat said, there are good reasons to think growth will continue to slow from here. The shutdown, for one, which came too late to matter much to Q4 but could be a big drag in Q1. Tax cuts and government spending increases helped boost growth last year, but those effects are now fading. And (to get a bit in the weeds for a second) Thursday's figures were helped by a build-up of inventories, which will probably reverse in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSo President Trump can cheer an economy that (at least by one measure) met his 3 percent target for 2018, but he's not likely to get a repeat performance in 2019. The big question now is whether that mild slowdown worsens into an outright recession. That's not the most likely scenario, but it's certainly a possibility, especially if global growth continues to cool or the trade war heats up. \n\nStay tuned. \n#economics #economists #presidency",

Walmart wants this message to be out there. \n\n\"Low prices is what we stand for, and we're going to keep prices as low as we can as long as we can. But when you look at the magnitude of some of the cost increases on certain categories of items that are imported, it's more than what retailers can bear. It's more than what suppliers can bear. And so we'll work hard to try to keep prices low. But it's unavoidable that you're going to see some prices go up on certain items. Well, if you've got a 30% tariff on something, you're likely going to see double digits [in price increases].\"\n\nI shouldn't need to say this, but obviously it won't just be Walmart. \n\nTwo questions: \n\nHow long before more \"deals\" make this go away? \n\nWill the markets look through this in the short term with the expectation that it eventually will go away? \n\nI don't have the answer to either.",

The early 2000s represented the high-water mark of neoliberalism—the “end of history” in which despotism would give way to democracy and free trade.\n\nNot coincidentally, this period also marked China’s rise in global commerce after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson identified the “China Shock” in a 2016 paper on the uneven effects of trade liberalization: 3.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Offshoring production to China accounted for 59.3% of U.S. manufacturing job losses, and most of these workers entered long-term unemployment.\n\nProponents of this wrecking-ball policy argued for making up its losses through wealth redistribution—as if a handout could heal the families and communities shattered by outsourcing. In the ultimate show of condescension, some academics labeled this the “compensate the losers” strategy. It failed miserably.\n\n- Scott Bessent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal",

He makes conciliatory remarks about the need for trade fairness but then says a recession is the likely result either way. \n\nThen he meets with Michigan Governor Whitmer (the way to think about her is she's the Mayor of Radiator Springs) who probably gives him an earful from the car people in Detroit.

Okay. I guess we'll all find out together. \n\nThere are those who would like this to end immediately because they can't imagine a single positive thing to come out of it. So far, we've seen gasoline prices fall and a decline in interest rates, so that's not nothing. I doubt the pleasure of paying less at the pump offsets the pain of having your car repossessed, but I'm always looking for silver linings. If mortgage rates fall, along with home prices, and you're a 32 year old looking for a place to start your family, you can call this a win so long as your employer doesn't eliminate your role. \n\nOthers don't necessarily care if the trade war actually brings about a manufacturing renaissance because it's enough to simply wipe out the investor class for revenge or just to level the playing field. \"I may not have wealth but you won't either,\" is an interesting belief system. Through 100,000 years of recorded human history there has never been a level playing field, but I understand the frustration that leads to this sort of sentiment. \n\nFinally, there are those who know tariffs won't work economically but they believe that the President is either using them for leverage to accomplish something strategic or orchestrating a brilliant geopolitical plan that the experts don't get. This would be a fun outcome, I suppose. So much imagination and creativity in this camp! Gold star. \n\nNo matter what you believe to be the case, it's helpful to start with some historical facts.

He did that after nearly a decade of grassroots efforts on the part of Anna Jarvis, to celebrate the achievements of her mom, Ann Jarvis. Ann was regarded as a selfless champion of infant health and mortality, suitable living conditions for mothers and families and, during the Civil War, assistance to soldiers on the battlefield no matter which side they were fighting for. The date, the second Sunday in May, was chosen to honor the day her mother died. \n \nWe love our mothers because they are sources of unconditional love, support and guidance – our first teachers – who set us on our way in the world. They can also be hard to buy for – what do you get for the person you literally gave you life? \n \nWell, if the LLMs have their way, they’d like to help make that decision easier. A few descriptive sentences in a prompt might actually deliver that perfect gift or ideal experience at just the right price point – and allow you to buy without ever leaving the conversation. It’s something I wrote about this week. \n \nBut whether you are shopping online, in the store, taking Mom for a manicure or sumptuous brunch or just sitting and talking at the kitchen table – enjoy your day. Happy Mother’s Day!",

The State of Digital Disbursements, a report PYMNTS Intelligence collaborated on with Ingo Payments, does exactly that, drawing upon seven years (2018–2025) of U.S. consumer data on disbursements, how consumers get them, from whom they are sent, and their preferences for how to receive those payments. It reflects a statistically representative analysis of 42,683 US consumers. \n \nThe share of consumers who want instant as a disbursement option and who pick it has increased 3x over that time. Today 79% of consumers say give me instant and give it to me as an option each time you want to send me money. And 97% of those who receive instant payments often – think of transactional payments like gig or freelance wages or tips – say it really is nearly all instant all of the time. \n \nIf you are looking for the definitive guide to how instant disbursements have evolved over time, and the use cases and preferences that are driving its increasing importance, look no further! You can access it in an instant! https://lnkd.in/eRabGCwu",

This is typically a case of a big company sending money to a small business, consumer or micropreneur. We find that one in five of those senders are feeling more pressure to do that. When looking at this data, we posit that it won’t be long before it becomes tablestakes. \n \nThis urgency to send instantly also offers new opportunities for senders to get creative about where that money is sent. Maybe it is sent to a new account that stays inside of their ecosystem, where the instant option is checked, and so is the ability to monetize instant in new ways as part of a new ecosystem that is receiver-centric but sender-enabled. \n \nThe business case for that can be found in this new report: Instant Payments: A Strategic Tool for Vendor Relationships and Urgent Transactions (our collaboration w/ Ingo Payments).

Bottom line. Americans are worried, and signaled their concerns even in the weeks before Liberation Day and the hefty sales tax that its tariffs will impose on every consumer and every business in the world in some way. \n \nA national study of 2,820 consumers conducted between March 12 and March 31 finds that then, nearly 80% of consumers were already pulling back by buying less or buying cheaper. Back of the envelope math suggests that could dent the US economy by $92B every year assuming just a 2% pullback. If prices increase by 10%, 18% of consumers say they will simply stop buying, increasing that even more. We’ll let you know what they say now that the reality is even worse then they imagined just a couple of weeks ago. \n \nThen, there’s the business uncertainty, which we captured by studying heads of product and CFOs of middle market companies. A third of those companies are facing supply chain disruption, higher prices, missed opportunities and hits to sales and margins. More than half of consumer and industrial goods companies say the same. \n \nThis week I was also compelled to try to find an analogy that might help to explain the chaos that the markets – and all of us by default - are experiencing. In that I found the good old fashioned game of pinball. I’ll let you read the piece to connect those dots, or pull the levers, as the case may be. \n \nWould love to know what you think. And what you are seeing and hearing from friends, family and business colleagues. \n \nThanks for reading. And thanks to Mariah Warner, PhD, Scott Murray, Yvonni Markaki and the PYMNTS Intelligence team for their insightful analysis.",

The role of subsidies in getting innovative platforms with a positive outcome for society off the ground.

Sometimes that comes from the government when concepts are still too new, and therefore lack critical mass, to step in where private investors can’t or won’t. \n \nI dig into this issue from a business model and market dynamics standpoint, and in doing so, found an interesting historical analogue with the first electric car ever produced in the US in the 1890’s. It’s amazing to me how some of the same industry speedbumps remain, all these years later.",

This week was all about uncertainty - in regulations, consumer behaviors, and what exactly \"paycheck-to-paycheck\" really means.\n\n► The paycheck paradox. Our groundbreaking 5-year study reveals the true face of America's financial reality: 67% live paycheck-to-paycheck, including surprisingly many earning $250K+. Some choose this lifestyle; others have no choice. We've identified two critical income thresholds ($45K and $125K) that transform spending behaviors. With recession whispers growing louder, this dataset offers essential insights for navigating what's ahead. My analysis: https://link: https://lnkd.in/eRjV_5uH\n\n► Genius or not so genius? The GENIUS Act for stablecoins has a flaw: it doesn't define what a stablecoin actually is. As Amias Gerety told me, it lacks crucial consumer protections if an issuer fails. Big banks see opportunity; community banks see threats: https://lnkd.in/emajQaAM\n\n► Big city dreams, small town realities. Location is reshaping SMB outlooks. Rural businesses are twice as likely to report declining revenues as urban ones, with workers (and their wallets) migrating back to city offices. Two Americas forming in the small business world: https://lnkd.in/e6wyps-R\n\n► The regulation pendulum. Bolt's Justin Grooms compared today's FinTech regulation to trucking deregulation decades ago. His concern? Rules that \"protect the status quo\" at innovation's expense. Finding that balance is the key challenge: https://lnkd.in/e6syWKKx\n\n► The uncertainty effect. Middle-market firms now see startups as their primary threat (up 2.6x in six months). The solution? Innovation. Companies with tech-driven strategies report 54% less uncertainty. A forward-looking mindset makes all the difference: https://lnkd.in/e6UxuWwu",

That’s probably because these consumers are extremely nuanced.  It’s not about being rich, it’s not about being poor, and paycheck-to-paycheck living is a continuum between choice and necessity.\n \nThere are also two critical income thresholds for the paycheck-to-paycheck consumer, and they span a wide range. The first is $45,000-$49,99; with the second being $125,000-$149,999.\n \nSo why’s it all matter now? Uncertainty, for one. It might be my word of the year, and it’s underscored by the current Administration’s comments that hint at a likely recession. After all, in order to be a paycheck-to-paycheck consumer, you first need to have a paycheck. \n \nUsing anything but a broad brush, my piece today seeks to use PYMNTS Intelligence data to paint a better portrait of who the paycheck-to-paycheck consumer really is.

    "Karen Webster's post 2mo ago": "The Canada/Mexico tariffs start date appears to be March 4th, according to a social post by the President this morning. \n \nPYMNTS Intelligence fielded a national study of 2,291 consumers and 560 SMBs between February 5 and February 12, right after the President announced them. We asked consumers about the impact of consumers on their lives, if they were to take effect. But we first wanted to understand how knowledgeable consumers and SMBs were on the topic. So we quizzed them. Turns out 71% passed the test, and are considered more than just familiar with the topic, but knowledgeable on the subject. \n \nI published a piece with those findings on February 19. I thought they were interesting. Here it is in case you missed it: https://lnkd.in/eSr4QnSz\n\nOf course, what people say (at the time it was all about the “what if”, and what people do, can be two different things. Hey, I don’t like spending $10 for a dozen of jumbo organic eggs and complain about how outrageous it is, but buy them anyway. But the most interesting insight was the role of uncertainty in how consumers and businesses said they would react. Oh, and SMBs, have fingers crossed it drives demand to buy local. \n \nWe’ll keep tabs on how this really unfolds as/when “what if” becomes “what now.”",

It’s also an anecdote to locking things behind Plexi and creating in store friction, he said, and boosting sales without boosting headcount.

    "Karen Webster's post 3mo ago": "Presidents Day week got me thinking about McKinley and tariffs (yes, really). Here's some highlights from this week, from new tools to tackle working capital to why returns might be retail's next frontier. \n\nGPS for your working capital. Working with Visa, PYMNTS has built something special - a first-of-its-kind dynamic benchmarking tool that helps middle-market firms navigate their working capital strategy. Want to know how you stack up against 1,300 peers across 23 countries? Now you can: https://lnkd.in/eu-xmnH9\n\nSpeaking of McKinley... Our latest study shows 71% of consumers are up to speed on potential new tariffs (everyone except Gen Z, that is). While half of small businesses see opportunity in \"buying local,\" consumers are hitting pause - 48.6% say they'll save more than spend if tariffs hit. My full analysis here: https://lnkd.in/eSr4QnSz\n\nPay-by-bank's loyalty play. Alexandre Gonthier told me why Trustly's betting on loyalty programs to crack retail's card-centric world. His prediction? Your bank account could become the new Apple Pay. But first, merchants need to trade those 1.5% processing fees for beefier rewards. See if you agree: https://lnkd.in/e_UdsDTK\n\nWhy not Reshop Right Away. The Afterpay co-founder's newest venture caught my eye. Anthony Eisen's take? Returns are the \"last white space\" in eCommerce. His solution at Reshop: instant refunds that keep shoppers who use debit cards to pay (think Gen Z and Millennials) in \"full focus\" with their brand. https://lnkd.in/dNzkMsdS\n\nSpeed dating with Brazil's Central Bank. PagBrasil just nabbed their Payment Institution license in record time. CEO Ralf Germer walked me through why this matters for cross-border Pix payments and what's next for LatAm's \"orchestration economy.\" Fascinating conversation here: https://lnkd.in/eJ6H3cQi\n\nHappy Friday! Let me know which story grabbed your attention - I'd love to hear your thoughts. Have a great weekend.",

Working capital efficiency is an invisible force that contributes to a healthy supplier ecosystem – valued and valuable in today’s uncertain environment. One of the outcomes of measuring working capital efficiency against one’s peers is seeing where opportunities exist to use working capital to do that, giving the business a market advantage and their suppliers new opportunities to grow and prosper.",

People do make conscious decisions to pay for time-saving conveniences, but it has less to do with how much income someone makes and more to do with how time-challenged people feel they are. For example, urban consumers spend about $234 monthly on convenience services compared to rural consumers' $186 - not because they necessarily make more, but because they're juggling different time pressures and have more services at their fingertips.\n\nThere’s a few more juicy details in the report itself. Give it a look and then let me know. What is your biggest time/money trade off? Mine is Instacart instead of not going to the grocery store. Especially in the winter 😊",

It’s felt. It’s survived.**\n\nYou don’t create a movement by thinking harder.\nYou become it—long before anyone else understands what you’re doing.\n\n\n1. Movements Start Where Strategy Ends\n\nStrategy is the map.\nA movement is the quake that shakes the ground beneath it.\n\nYou don’t need a perfect plan.\nYou need the courage to move when it’s just you, your vision, and the tension of knowing you can’t stay still.\n\n\n2. You Lead From the Front—Exposed and Early\n\nMovements aren’t crowd-sourced.\nThey’re led by those willing to stand alone until momentum catches up.\n\nIf you’re waiting for validation, you’re already too late.\n\n\n3. Movements Aren’t Owned—They’re Transferred\n\nYou don’t trademark transformation.\nYou ignite it in others until they carry it forward without even realizing it started with you.\n\n\n4. Movements Begin in the Bones—Not the Boardroom\n\nIt’s not intellectual.\nIt’s visceral.\n\nIf you don’t feel it in your gut, if it doesn’t keep you awake at night demanding motion—you’re not building a movement.\nYou’re curating content.\n\n\n5. Movements Leave Scars—And That’s the Proof\n\nYou’ll bleed for it.\nYou’ll outgrow rooms.\nYou’ll lose the ones who only wanted the polished version of leadership.\n\nBut when the wave rises, you’ll know:\nYou didn’t craft a movement.\nYou survived birthing it—and that’s why it lives.\n\nHere’s Your Invitation:\n\nIf this hits you in the bones—good.\nThat means you’re one of us.\n\nBecause this isn’t just theory.\nThere’s a movement already in motion—AI-X.\n\nA movement for leaders who know that AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a power amplifier.\nFor those who don’t want to automate tasks—they want to elevate leadership.\nFor the ones ready to fuse emotional intelligence, bold strategy, and AI into something that actually changes how we lead.\n\nWe’re not waiting for permission.\nWe’re already building.\n\nIf you’re ready to lead where others hesitate—join us.\n\nWelcome to AI-X.\nWhere movements aren’t crafted.\nThey’re unleashed.\n\nLet me know you’re in—\nThe movement moves fast.\n\n#aix #radicalcpa #accountingandaccountants",

I lead deep.\nAnd those roles don’t all play well in the same room.\n\nSo I’ve stopped forcing them to.\n\nThere’s:\n   •   CEO Jody – sharp, fast, strategic. She builds.\n   •   Radical CPA – the soul voice. She sees patterns before they form. She whispers “dream with me” and sets movements on fire.\n   •   Mom Jody – grounding. Real life. Family first.\n   •   Client Jody – clean delivery, professional, on-mission for others.\n   •   The Integrator – she doesn’t talk much. But she watches everything. She holds the emotional weight no one else sees.\n\nThey’re all me.\nBut they’re not the same.\nAnd when I tried to lead from all of them at once?\n\nI burned out. I blurred boundaries. I got lost in the fog.  And ChatGPT had a hard time keeping up with me!  A lot of people do-robots included!!!!\n\nSo I did the most practical, radical thing I could:\n\nI trained ChatGPT to hold each Jody separately.  This is a new upgrade in ChatGPT as of yesterday.  So update your memory with the prompt below!\n\nNow I don’t have to carry it all in my head.\nMy AI knows who’s speaking.\nMy AI remembers which Jody leads what.\nMy AI reflects me cleanly—no confusion, no bleed.\n\nLeadership moves faster.\nMy fire stays sharper.\nAnd I don’t lose myself in the swirl.\n\n\nWant to do the same? Here’s the prompt I used to train it:\n\n*“I want you to help me manage my different leadership voices. I have multiple personas I use for different parts of my work and life. Please remember each one separately and never confuse them. Here are my personas:\n\t1.\tCEO [Your Name] – strategy, operations, decisions.\n\t2.\tVisionary [Your Name] – emotionally intuitive, transformational, movement builder.\n\t3.\tClient [Your Name] – focused delivery for others.\n\t4.\tParent [Your Name] – grounding and family.\n\t5.\tThe Integrator – watches energy shifts and holds patterns.\n\nWhen I tell you which persona I’m in, reflect that voice. If I don’t say, ask me. If I shift mid-conversation, adapt. Your job is to hold my clarity and never confuse them.”*\n\n\nAI isn’t just tech.\nIt’s identity infrastructure.\n\nIt’s how I lead boldly without splintering my power.\n\nThis is how the next generation of thought leaders are going to work—with full complexity, cleanly held.\n\nDream with me.\n\n#RadicalCPA #AILeadership #ThoughtLeadership #PersonalClarity #FutureOfWork #EmotionalInfrastructure\n#accountingandaccountants",

Some of you knew the details, most of you just saw the momentum. If you’ve been following me, you’ve seen me talk about AI-X, leadership, and where the profession is headed.\n\nWhat you didn’t see? There was another version of this story happening behind the scenes. One that isn’t happening anymore.\n\nWell, here it is: It’s not happening.\n\nThat’s not easy to say. When you pour everything into a vision—when you KNOW it could be game-changing—letting go is hard. But real leadership isn’t just about pushing forward. It’s about knowing when to pivot.\n\nAnd if I was willing to share the excitement, I won’t hide the lesson. Because that’s how I roll.\n\n\n🔥 Two Leaders, Two Styles, One Big Lesson 🔥\n\nSome leaders move FAST—instinct, momentum, and making bold plays in real time.\nOthers move through structure—positioning, calculated steps, and long-term pacing.\n\nBoth styles work. Both can build something great.\n\nBut leadership isn’t just about how YOU move—it’s about whether the people around you can move WITH you.\n\n💡 Can instinct and structure operate at the same speed?\n💡 Can vision and hesitation exist in the same room?\n💡 Can two leaders build something massive if they see power and risk completely differently?\n\nSometimes, the answer is yes.\nThis time, the answer was no.\n\nAnd when that happens, you have two choices: Keep forcing it, or let go and build something even better.\n\nI’m choosing better.\n\n🚀 The Vision Didn’t Happen, But AI-X Is Only Getting Bigger\n\nNot every partnership works out. Not every idea takes off. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth it. Some experiences aren’t about the destination—they’re about sharpening your direction.\n\nAnd trust me, what’s next is even bigger.\n\nThe AI-X Movement is already in motion!  Redefining how accountants, advisors, and firms think about leadership, technology, and the future of work. THIS is where the real transformation happens. THIS is what I’m building.\n\nIf you thought that vision was big, just wait. The best moves come after the hardest lessons.

They’ll be playing catch-up in a world that’s already moved on.\nSo ask yourself:\n 👉 Are you waiting?\n 👉 Or are you leading?\nBe a market shifter. Be an AI-X Firm. Lead the future.   \n\nWHO WANTS IN?\n\nAccounting Today article in the comments.\n\n#AI #Accounting #radicalcpa #accountingandaccountants #Leadership #MarketShifters #AIXFirms",

And not just in the “let’s write some emails faster” kind of way. \n\nI’m talking about ChatGPT as your BUSINESS. BEST. FRIEND.\n\nStop Prompting. Start Thinking.\n\nRight now, most accountants are still tiptoeing into AI—using it to draft emails, clean up copy, maybe speed up some processes. But that’s just scratching the surface.

But here’s the deal:\n\n✅ AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a co-founder.\n✅ We’re not just “adopting AI”—we’re building AI-first firms.\n \nThe firms that get this NOW will redefine what an advisory firm even IS.\n\nThis isn’t about fear. It’s about opportunity. If you’re still hesitant, let me tell you: AI isn’t here to replace you. It’s here to make you a 10X better thinker, advisor, and leader.\n\nThe Future of Firms Is AI-First.\n\nThis shift is happening right now. And I know, after tax season, a lot of you will be looking up, wondering what’s next.\n\n👉 This. This is next. AI is not just a cool efficiency hack—it’s the new foundation.

It’s about data, clarity, and structured decision-making.\n\nOver the last three weeks, I ran an AI-Speed Leadership Assessment to track how AI is reshaping decision-making, hesitation, and trust in leadership—including my own. The results? Game-changing.\n\nSpeed of Leadership Decisions: +42.86%\n(AI helped me cut through hesitation, making my decisions clearer and faster.)\n\nHandling Hesitation in Others: +50.00%\n(Seeing hesitation as a structural issue rather than a frustration completely changed how I approach it.)\n\nEmotional Weight Processing: +80.00%\n(Biggest unlock? Separating emotion from execution. AI helped me process challenges without getting stuck in them.)\n\nStructuring Leadership Trust: +50.00%\n(Trust isn’t just assumed—it has to be intentionally structured to keep leadership alignment strong.)\n\nEngagement with Hesitant Leaders: +60.00%\n(Leadership momentum doesn’t have to stall when people hesitate—structured re-engagement strategies make all the difference.)\n\nThe Big Takeaway?\nAI isn’t just making leadership faster—it’s making hesitation instantly visible. I’ve seen firsthand how what used to be a slow, strategic process now happens in real time. Leaders who once had weeks or months to process power shifts now have to adjust instantly.\n\nMost firms are still using AI for tasks instead of leadership. But the real power is in AI-assisted decision-making, strategic processing, and clarity in high-stakes situations.\n\n📢 These were my scores—where would you land?

But when I started breaking it down with AI and data, everything clicked.\n\nAI didn’t just organize my thoughts—it pushed me to name, refine, and stress-test what I already knew.

I then asked a colleague, Vanessa Wang at DWS, what the firm is doing better because her team is 45 percent women. Not only did she share, she suggested senior women at DWS clients share too. \n\nI know this is not a big enough sample size, but I have tried to capture the main insights in the ‘the female factor - with Hansi’ podcast (linked below).\n\nSome insights - \n\nFinance is still perceived to be about numbers and math. While these women overcame their hesitation, it’s likely that young girls get turned off by this. Some segments/functions are more numbers-heavy, but obviously not true for the whole industry.\n\nWomen work differently to men. While  some see diversity as an advantage, others may not.\n\nWomen have to work harder and be better to get and keep their seat at the table.\n\nThere are biases against women as they rise through the ranks, including in the pay.\n\nYes, women could adapt to the current biased workplace. But what’s the harm in the workplace adapting to women to make them feel more welcome?\n\nGetting more women into finance is important as the clientele changes. (And Zerodha is doing that with its initiatives and investments). \n\n\nI would welcome any thoughts, and more volunteers to share their perspective on the podcast. I was thinking of picking up one segment/geography at a time, and then perhaps broaden to other industries.\n\nVanessa Wang DWS Group",

He called Somerville a scientist, in part because “man of science” seemed inappropriate for a woman, but more significantly because Somerville’s work was interdisciplinary. She was no mere astronomer, physicist, or chemist, but a visionary thinker who articulated the connections among the various branches of inquiry. \n\nAccording to Somerville’s biographer Kathryn Neeley, Whewell’s coinage of the word  “scientist” was not meant to be merely a gender-neutral neutral term. Whewell wanted a word that actively celebrated “the peculiar illumination of the female mind”: the ability to synthesize separate fields into a single discipline.” \n\nIn suggesting the term “scientist,” he emphasized its similarity to how the word “artist” is formed. Indeed, he had recognized in Somerville that singular creative genius of drawing connections between the seemingly disconnected, which is itself an artistic achievement. \n\nI learn something new every time I read Maria Popova.\n#gender",

    "Hansi Mehrotra's post 1yr ago": "Are you still at this (financial education)?...someone asked yesterday.\n\nYes I am. 'Cos I am still learning. 'Cos there is still work to be done.\n\nThe journey started decades ago...\n\nI first started working on investor education in 1999 as a twenty-something year old working at an influential investment research firm in Australia. We were trying to help investors select the appropriate asset allocation, mutual funds and stocks within their retirement accounts - given that they were about to get that choice in the middle of a raging bull market. We didn’t quite make it to them - the sharemarket bubble burst, they lost money in their retirement accounts and I lost money on my employers' stock. \n\nLeading up to the 2008 bull market, I tried to revive the idea with my now institutional consulting employer. I now had remit over Asia Pacific..I was excited when the Indian regulators drafted a comprehensive plan on financial education alongside the launch of the New Pension System. The market crashed again, the government changed, the idea was put on the back burner again. \n\nI quit corporate life eventually.\n\nI tried again in 2012 this time as a content startup that would provide continuing professional development to wealth managers and short animated videos to their investors at just-in-time at point-of-sale. The Indian industry was not interested so I walked away again.\n\nIn 2014, I wrote a book, but never sent it to the publisher because a friend’s feedback was that I was trying to go from 0 to 10. I had started with the very basics of personal finance and ended up with very advanced techniques of how to select mutual funds and stocks.\n\nIn 2015, I started drip-feeding the chapter summaries as LinkedIn posts. A few of my posts did well - and to my surprise, I found myself on the inaugural global TopVoices list for finance. I got an offer to collaborate on a web-series in which we used humour - the coin-headed Sikka was a proxy for the finance industry that spouted jargon while I tried to communicate the basic premise that finance was common sense. It worked! But then the firm shut down.\n\nOver the next few years, I kept experimenting with formats - short videos, explainer illustrations, podcasts, some with the help of the investor education budgets of mutual funds, but mostly on my own. A few more LinkedIn awards later, just as I was getting ready to pitch for an OTT web series, of course there was a bull market, not just in the stock market but also in the content pushed out by twenty-something ‘finfluencers’. You guessed it - it went on the back burner again.\n\nAnd now I am launching yet another series : )",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 1mo ago": "Final post on this topic. I started by questioning whether junior engineers would disappear entirely (spoiler: they won't), then discussed how we can evolve the ecosystem to better support them, and examined why senior engineers remain irreplaceable (IMO) despite AI advancements.\n\nBut just being a better junior engineer is not the only path. For some, the path forward may not lie in traditional employment at all. As AI lowers the barriers to building software, I think we’ll see an entrepreneurial explosion. Armed with powerful AI tools and a scrappy mindset, new engineers (note that I don’t say young) are uniquely positioned to identify and solve problems that established companies overlook.\n\nThis evolution will require junior engineers to expand beyond pure coding skills. They’ll need to develop product intuition, user empathy, business acumen, and the ability to navigate ambiguity – skills that AI augments but cannot yet completely replace. That said, it's important to recognise that entrepreneurship is not for everyone. Starting a business requires a particular set of skills, risk tolerance, and life circumstances that not everyone will have or want. We need to be careful not to present entrepreneurship as the only alternative to obsolescence. For many, the goal will still be to develop their skills and grow within an established organisation.\n\nIncreasingly, as with all roles, AI presents both a threat and an opportunity for aspiring engineers at the start of their careers. Those who cling to the old definition of a junior engineer as an entry-level coder may indeed find themselves automated out of the traditional job market.\n\nAs for me? I'm betting on smart people making the most of what they have available. I think the best junior engineers who grow up with AI as their native toolset will be capable of ideas we can barely conceive today, as long as we have the wisdom to nurture them.\n\nIf you’ve read the whole set of posts, hope you’ve enjoyed them!

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 1mo ago": "Originally, I was only going to make this series a trilogy, but ran across a tweet from someone whose opinion and experience I respect greatly. Their point was that AI shrinks the skills premium. And people who would normally have hired seniors are actually fine now hiring just juniors and mid-level because “the AI can solve all the system and logic problems”.\n\nTo some extent, this is true. It’s absolutely the case that AI amplifies. But I’ll go back to one of my key beliefs: In theory, practice and theory are the same. In practice, they’re not. Practice comes from experience and there's no way to shortcut it. Early on in your career, I think most people (and I’m including myself here) don’t know what they don’t know. And at a startup, speed trumps all else so you have a bunch of people building lots of things fast. Typically, in my experience, two things happen here:\n\n1. You built it quick and dirty because you didn't have the experience to understand what would happen down the line (haste v speed). The problem is that you didn’t find that out until you had enough customers for it to matter. Now you're trying to scale your customers and build new products but your code is at the breaking point and getting in the way of sales and existing customer engagement. \n\n2. You wind up with spaghetti systems because nobody was thinking with the full context of how it would all fit together. Now, the codebase is increasingly difficult to understand, debug and maintain. Complex interdependencies mean changes in one area cause unexpected breakages in seemingly unrelated areas. Development velocity slows to a crawl and you need to overhaul the whole system.\n\nCue the shitstorm and urgent need for someone who actually knows what they're doing. In my experience, having a strong senior leader who has the experience, i.e. prior mistakes and bad judgment, with a small but hungry set of juniors generates the better outcome. Post 4 coming up soon.\n\n#JuniorEngineering #AIEngineers #LeadershipDevelopment #FutureOfTechTalent #EntrepreneurialEngineers",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 1mo ago": "In my first post in this series, I wondered what would happen to the junior engineering role. \n\nSome great comments from various people and here’s where I’ve ended up. There’s no question that things are going to change, both for juniors themselves and also for those who hire them. And this change is not small - it’s radical.\n\nThe junior engineers who will thrive in the age of AI are those who can work with AI, not compete against it. They'll become AI-native professionals, using tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot and Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini to amplify their productivity. However, their true competitive advantage will come from a deep, rigorous understanding of computer science fundamentals that allows them to critically evaluate and comprehend the code and solutions AI generates.\n\nI think a comprehensive computer science education becomes more crucial than ever – not just to learn syntax or algorithms, but to develop the analytical skills needed to understand why an AI-generated solution works, recognise its potential flaws, and improvise where AI falls short. This means critically examining AI-generated code, tracing its logic, understanding its performance characteristics, and knowing when to trust or challenge an AI's recommendations. Value lies not in simply accepting AI's output, but in bringing rigorous technical depth and knowing when “vibe coding” won’t cut it.\n\nFor companies, this means overhauling talent development. CEOs and engineering leaders will likely hire fewer junior engineers, but those roles will become more intensive and strategic apprenticeships. Senior engineers will transform into technical mentors, focusing less on traditional management and more on deep technical teaching, bringing junior engineers into high-level architectural discussions and product strategy sessions. And frankly, I think most engineering managers would enjoy this more.\n\nThe future of junior engineering isn't about replacement – it's about amplification. The most successful junior engineers will see AI as a powerful tool that extends their capabilities, not a threat to their career. The companies who can extend those capabilities will find themselves doing more with less, while maintaining happy employees who want to stay for the long run.\n\nBut what if you’re a junior engineer and can’t find a role in this reduced pool? More to come. Consider this part 2, with part 3 wrapping up the posts soon.\n\n#JuniorEngineering #AIEngineers #LeadershipDevelopment #FutureOfTechTalent #EntrepreneurialEngineers",

Junior engineers bring fresh energy and perspectives that keep our teams innovative. They ask the \"dumb questions\" that challenge calcified assumptions. And critically, they grow into the senior engineers who will lead or build companies in the future. If AI were to replace our juniors wholesale, how would we get to the next generation of technical leaders? \n\nAs a CEO and founder, I can understand the pressure to use AI to cut costs and increase velocity. In a tough economic climate, there is a very real and expensive decision to be made about hiring inexperienced professionals who need management and support. A junior hire is not a decision to be made lightly. \n\nSo, to what extent should a CEO be thinking about their long-term commitment to the technical ecosystem beyond their company's growth?\n\nI’ve been thinking about this deeply, and have more thoughts to share over the next few days.

I think it's been in beta for some time, but I always prefer to use the stable version of Maps since I'm so reliant on it for Android Auto. Instead of the big blue arrow, you can now customise your car and colour during driving directions.\n\nIt's interesting to think about from a product standpoint because it doesn't add any functional value. Maybe there's some argument about how its easier to see, but I think that's a stretch. And it's probably extra work to properly orient the car as its driving on roads. I remember this being tricky at Uber when we first did it. But if you have the luxury of the extra resources that a company like Google has, it should be such a cool design feature; should being the operative word here.\n\nThe problem with it is that the designers seemed to put a lot of thought into what the side view would be but nowhere near the same amount of thought into what the top down view would be. The sportscar looks great on the screen where you customise but it doesn't look anywhere near as good in the actual driving view. It's a bit disappointing.",

Design is not some intrinsic set of capabilities born to a select group of chosen people. Like anything, it's a skill that you can get better at. And the great thing about it is that there are tons of practical guides out there to help product managers and engineers design well. I really like the Refactoring UI book by the Tailwind people. It's full of lovely practical tidbits.\n\nMy thinking on having such defined roles about what a PM does v. a designer v. an engineer has changed dramatically over the past few years.

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 3mo ago": "Last week, I was texting with a friend who runs growth and product at a SaaS healtech startup. We were chatting about his open roles - two engineers. I asked him about designers and his comment was “we don’t need them”.\n\nAfter my recent post about AI/PMs (with plenty of heated debates in the comments 🍿), this got me thinking about the evolution of the design role along the same lines as Product Management.\n\nI think people don't want to admit this out loud but 99% of SaaS products don't need custom designs. They need clean, functional interfaces that solve real problems.\n\nI'm not talking about brand/graphic design or illustrations - that's a different game. Instead, I'm talking about the day-to-day UX work that powers most SaaS products. And here's the reality: the tools that exist today have commoditised good design.\n\nshadcn/ui: The new king of component libraries. Never heard of it? It's basically LEGO for web apps - gorgeous, accessible components that just work. Teams like Vercel and Stripe are already using these patterns.\n\nUntitled UI: The \"premium template\" that somehow powers half the SaaS products you use (yes, even the ones that raised millions). It's not cheap, but it's cheaper than a designer.\n\nTailwindUI/DaisyUI: The \"I need it done yesterday\" solution that still looks professional. Thousands of components and ready to go out of the box.\n\nThese aren't just templates - they're battle-tested UX patterns that work. And AI is getting scary good at mixing and matching these components into coherent interfaces.\n\n\"But AI can't understand user needs!\" Okay, fine. But neither can designers who are debating corner radius in Figma comments and not talking to paying users every day.\n\nThe hard truth about AI and UX design:\n- AI will generate your layouts\n- AI will implement your components\n- AI will handle responsive design\n- AI will maintain visual consistency\n\nBut here's what AI can't do (yet):\n- Read between the lines of real user feedback (users say they want dark mode, but they really want to feel like power users)\n- Balance stakeholder politics (the CEO's pet feature conflicts with what users actually need)\n- Understand cultural nuances that affect user behavior (why a design pattern that works in the US flops in China)\n- Identify when to break design rules (know when consistency should take a backseat to solving a unique problem)\n\nSound familiar? It should. Just like with PMs, the mediocre will be automated away. And maybe that's not a bad thing. I don’t think SaaS users care if your design is \"unique.\" They care if it works.

The egg develops quickly and then eats the young insects from the nest while they're still in the larval stage. Then it goes, leaving behind nothing of value.\n\nMeet its digital equivalent: the domain name squatter (Domainus Squatterus).\nThese parasites crawl the web looking for expiring domains or any domain that hasn't been taken yet, snatch them up, and park them on the cheapest possible hosting showing nothing but automated ads. They contribute zero value. Their sole purpose? Waiting to extort money from legitimate businesses who actually want to build products and create value with a legitimately named domain. In case you couldn't guess, this post was prompted by exactly my experience this morning for the next new product I'm working on.\n\nJust as the velvet ant is falsely named (it's a wasp, not an ant), these squatters often hide behind shell companies and anonymous registrations. They're not 'domain investors' or 'digital real estate specialists' - they're parasites who do nothing but exploit.\n\nAt least the velvet ant follows natural instinct.

Here's what happened:\n\n1. Went to community page\n2. Got \"Welcome\" pop up with no content and two options\n3. Tried Done\n4. Redirected to the same page with the same popup\n5. Tried again. Same result.\n6. Tried a different browser. Same result.\n7. Tried to log into community profile, blank and redirected to Step 1.\nREPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT. BANG HEAD AGAINST DESK IN FRUSTRATION.\n(see video if you want to recreate said frustration)\n\nLook, I get it. I'm a tiny developer in Meta's vast ecosystem. My problems aren't keeping Mark Zuckerberg up at night.\n\nBut here's what's fascinating:\nMeta is betting billions on the metaverse, yet can't maintain basic developer forum functionality. This isn't about a complex API issue or advanced feature request - it's about the simple ability to ask a question.\n\nThe irony?\nI wanted to ask about implementing a social feature. You know, the kind of thing Facebook pioneered.\n\nThree observations:\n1. The developer experience reflects your priorities. When basic community features don't work, it sends a clear message about how much you value developer time.\n\n2. Great products can survive bad documentation. But they create unnecessary friction and slow down innovation.\n\n3. The size of the platform doesn't guarantee the quality of the tools. Sometimes it means there's less incentive to get the small things right.\n\nMaybe my experience is unique. Maybe I hit some rare bug that affects 0.01% of users.\n\nBut if you're building developer tools, remember this: \nYour smallest users today could be your biggest advocates tomorrow. Or they could just move on to platforms that let them ask questions.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Or am I just doing something obviously wrong? \n\n#DeveloperExperience #SoftwareDevelopment #Facebook #Meta",

Here's my honest take on this kind of tool:\n\n😃 The good:\n- Quick (and surprisingly not that dirty) because it was built while my 3 & 5-year-olds interrupted me about 17 times (try that with regular coding!)\n- It immediately understood both the UI needs and target user (toddlers)\n- Deployment was seamless - straight to web\n\n🙁 The bad:\n- AI simply couldn't understand drag and drop even though it repeatedly said it had implemented what I had asked for\n- New code broke existing features so I had to consistently redo work and create more prompts\n- Generated code was overdone and not terribly clean - I'd probably refactor and rework areas if I was building from scratch\n\nThe fascinating part? Even with these limitations, I shipped a working magnetic fridge app in the time it usually takes to watch a movie.\n\n5 years ago, this would have taken days. 2 years ago, maybe 8 hours.

Here's my 🌶️ take:\nIf AI can do your job completely, you weren't that good at it in the first place.\n\nHere's why and how I've identified good product leaders with a single interview question:\n\"What's your favourite physical product?\"\n\nOne of the best answers I ever heard in 15+ years of interviewing PMs? A candidate broke down... a corkscrew 🍷. Their analysis focused on user anxiety, not features. They mapped the mechanical leverage to price positioning as a luxury product. And they showed how manufacturing constraints drove brand strategy. I thought it was inspired. This person is still an incredible product leader at top companies today.\n\nThe hard truth about AI and product management:\n- AI will write your PRDs\n- AI will analyse your data\n- AI will prioritise your backlog\n- AI will develop your product strategy\n\nBut here's what AI can't do (and if you can't either, you should be worried):\n- See invisible trade-offs\n- Figure out what compromise reveals about executive priorities\n- Decode human psychology\n- Understand why users say they want X but actually need Y\n- Notice how subtle design choices create emotional resonance\n- Know which features really matter vs look good in meetings\n- Connect strategic dots\n\nThe reality about product management (or any role, for that matter) in the AI age is that the mediocre will be automated away. As it should be. But exceptional thinking - the kind that sees patterns AI can't, that understands humans in ways data doesn't show - is becoming more valuable, not less.\n\nThe greatest risk isn't AI.

Whether that's push notifications on my phone, or email newsletters, I've tried hard to be judicious about where I want to spend my time.\n\nI understand that user engagement metrics are important, and of course, companies want to have ways and means to communicate with their users. My default setting is to turn notifications off, and only turn them on later if I'm using the product enough that I believe the notifications will give me value. Perhaps that's not the default for most but when companies push notifications at me, my immediate rage-reaction is to turn everything off. \n\nAnd that's exactly what happened with LinkedIn today morning. I've noticed that I get a ton of emails and notifications from LI, and I don't ever recall signing up for them. Normally I delete them right away and move on but today, something cracked. After yet another irrelevant and frankly useless email, I went to my notifications settings on LinkedIn.\n\nIf you haven't done this, prepare yourself. This is apparently the newly reorganised, \"simple\" version. There are 13 individual categories with another 3-10 settings within each category and in some cases, a tab underneath the category that contains further settings. Not only that, EVERYTHING IS TURNED ON BY DEFAULT. And there is no one click option to turn it all off.\n\nThis should be an obvious lesson but I'll say it again. Please don't sign up your users for communications without providing clear value and ideally, getting their explicit consent. Product teams can do better than this.",

But now that we're actually here and I'm reflecting, I'm blown away by the technological advancements that I've seen come to life. They might seem commonplace to us now. Yet, I can't help but think of the Arthur C. Clark quote: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”\n\nHere are three things that seem so everyday now but as a child, I wouldn't have imagined that they would be.\n\n1. Mobile 📱 \nMy family was pretty into tech growing up. We saved up to buy new computers and we had internet access. My dad even had a \"mobile\" phone in what seemed like a suitcase. To now carry around a device that can perform incredibly complex tasks and instantly connect with anyone worldwide feels magical. The computing power in our pockets exceeds what sent humans to the moon, and we can use it to scroll through cat videos and order pizza!\n\n2. Self-driving cars 🚗\nWhen I was a kid, KITT from Knight Rider was pure science fiction. I even have a photo of myself sitting in the car at a theme park. A car that could drive itself seemed as far-fetched as teleportation. Yet here we are, with vehicles that can navigate complex traffic situations, park themselves, and even summon themselves from parking spots. While we're not quite at the level of KITT's witty banter, the fact that I can take my hands off the wheel on the highway and trust the car to maintain speed and lane position still feels surreal.\n\n3. AI 🤖\nThis might be the most \"magical\" of all. Growing up, AI was either the menacing HAL 9000 or the friendly but clearly artificial Johnny 5. The idea that I could have a natural conversation with an AI, ask it to write code, analyse data, or help me write a story would have blown my young mind. Now we casually chat with AI assistants, use them to generate art, and solve complex problems. Even my 5 year old uses ChatGPT to ask questions and make bedtime stories.\n\nWhat's perhaps most remarkable is how quickly we adapt to these technologies, making the magical seem mundane. Yet when we step back and look through the eyes of our younger selves, it's truly magical. I know that there are also very real and negative consequences of new technologies but I'm fundamentally a tech optimist at heart and I believe that used in the right way, we'll continually advance humanity.\n\nHappy new year! Here's to 2025 and all the years to come.",

Stats time! #️⃣  \n\nIt's been amazing to see people play Quiz Pro Quo (https://quizproquogame.com) since I launched it last week! Now that hundreds of scores have been logged, I wanted to validate my approach to difficulty grading and understand what categories work well.\n\nThe game has four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, quizmaster and hard. The idea is that most people should be able to get the easy question right, which should give them confidence to progress. But I also didn't want to make it so easy that people wouldn't feel challenge. Here's what I was aiming for and the breakdown in the first week:\n\n🙂 EASY goal: 90% correct -> actual: 72%\n😅 MEDIUM goal: 60% correct -> actual: 63% \n🤔 HARD goal: 40% correct -> actual: 45%\n🤓 QUIZMASTER goal: 20% correct -> actual: 35%\n\nKey takeaway from here - make the easy questions easier. \n\nNext, I was curious as to what categories people knew most about. The game has a very broad reach of topics and is played globally. There are individual categories on a daily basis and my AI has also categorised each of these into a super category (thank you, Trivial Pursuit). So, what do people know most about? \n\n🌎 Geography: 75% correct answers\n🏅 Sports & Leisure: 54% correct answers\n🎨 📖 Art & Literature: 45% correct answers\n🔬 Science & Nature: 44% correct answers\n🪩 Entertainment: 43% correct answers\n🗓️ History: 26% correct answers\n\nThis doesn't take into account that some categories have had more questions than others. Once the festive 12 Days of Quiz Pro Quo is finished, I'm going to be trying out a daily approach, where each day has a category and Sunday is always a grab bag. \n\nThanks for playing, everyone! I've had some great conversations and feedback from people who've been playing so thanks for helping me continually iterate. I've got some exciting new features coming up in the new year that I can't wait to build and share with you.",

    "Mina Radhakrishnan's post 5mo ago": "As I continue to work on building a trivia brain, I'm finding the limits of what AI can do today. Building good trivia is an art form, and while I do believe my current model has improved from where it started, there's still a fair amount of human refinement.\n\nWhen writing emails or blog posts, I find that AI is very good at giving you something 60-70% of the way with just one prompt. Then, human refinement comes into play. Whereas, in the context of trivia, I find that AI is actually not particularly good at coming up with interesting topics. It tends to be quite bland, and is actually much better at generating questions and answers after a theme is created rather than creating the theme itself.\n\nGiven that it's the holiday season, I've had the 12 Days of Christmas song in my head on repeat. And I wanted to do a fun twist on it for Quiz Pro Quo, i.e. the 12 days of Quiz Pro Quo. The idea was to take the gift from each day and build a themed category around it without being literal.\n\n🪿 🐓 🕊️ 🦢 🐦‍⬛  For example, there are a lot of birds being gifted (23 to be exact). I tried many different prompts to come up with interesting ideas but didn't have much luck. Instead, I literally had to go back to the drawing board and whiteboard a number of ideas before finding a unique bunch of topics that didn't all have the same approach. \n\nI also decided to expand the game by introducing image clues. I think this also makes the game more accessible by showing pictures rather than just pure text.  Building this out actually involved far more database work than actual coding, so it was another lesson learned. I've expanded this to be much more flexible so that in the future, I'll also include audio clues, much like your favourite pub quiz.\n\n🎄  In any case, the 12 Days of Quiz Pro Quo is now live!

While I do have a computer science degree and worked as a software engineer during internships and in the very early stages of my career, I fell in love with Product and there was no looking back.\n\nBut life is a cycle! In building my new project, a focus for me was ownership of every piece. And I knew that the only way to do that was to learn to build again. The difference between coding when I first started v. coding again in 2024 is 🤯 . \n\nI think the hardest part of starting to code is the infrastructure and setup of projects. What stack should you use? How do you create a local environment? What are the right tools to edit code? How do you use those tools effectively? How do you test and deploy? There's a lot to do that doesn't even relate to your ability to code but rather to use a computer to enable your ability to write the first line of code. But no more. With several questions to Claude and ChatGPT, 5 blog posts and some reading of documentation, I was up and running. The whole experience of setup took several hours and was guided almost continuously by helpful AI assistants. It's a testament to the power of good products. They recognise that your ultimate goal is not to set up your machine; it is to create what you've imagined. And they enable you to do exactly that.\n\nFor those of you wondering, here's what my tech stack ended up looking like:\n- SvelteKit + Supabase for frontend, backend and storage\n- Vercel for hosting and deployment (using their analytics and performance tools too)\n- Cursor AI for IDE\n- v0 for temporary tools to help build along the way that aren't part of production\n\nBringing your ideas to life is a superpower.

But as a founder, I think we shouldn’t get too fixated on what’s happening in the outside environment. \n\nFundamentally, you need one of two things to be successful as a startup founder. \n\n👉 Either you’re building a product that will lower costs by increasing efficiencies and improving the level of service offered. \n\n👉 On the flip side, you might be building a growth product that is going to drive revenue and get you one step closer to profitability. \n\nRegardless of what’s happening in the outside economic climate, you need to be focused on (at least) one of these two things. \n\nThe only thing that changes in an economic downturn is where you focus your capital and resources. \n\nIf things are going gangbusters, you might have 70% of your roadmap focused on growth and revenue products. On the flip side, if there are choppy waters ahead, you’re likely to put more emphasis on efficiency and cost-reduction products. \n\nThe core building blocks of designing products and building a good company don’t change, your focus simply needs to shift between growth vs. efficiency. \n\n#BusinessGrowth #Growth #Scaling #FounderInsights",

On the flip side, a scaleup founder is likely looking at their goals for the next quarter, six months, or beyond. \n\nOnce you know what timeframe you’re working within, set aside time each week to focus on what’s really going to move the needle. \n\nI always think our calendar is a good reflection of what we value and how we spend our time. \n\nSo, take a look at where you spent your time over the past few weeks and really ask yourself if it's aligned with what you want to be focusing on. 📆 👀\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that my calendar isn’t perfect. But I’m always trying to hold myself accountable and work towards spending 75-80% of my time on work that is going to drive our company forward. \n\n#Startup #StartupFounder #Scaleup",

Because you’re in a pivotal stage of growth, and you need to invest in people and a team structure that will help you move the needle. 💪\n\nIn my view, Series A and B stage startups need to make smart hiring decisions that allocate resources in the right places. You likely don’t need a big middle management team and should instead be building a team where people know exactly what they’re responsible for. \n\nHiring should be done consciously, while allowing for a level of flexibility, too. \n\n💡 A good place to start is figuring out what are your short to medium terms goals, and focusing on allocating resources towards that for the next 6-12 months. \n\nObviously, small corrections and adjustments might need to be made along the way. \n\nBut ideally, you shouldn’t need to reconsider your org structure more than once every six months, even as an early-stage company. \n\n#Startup #OrgStructure #TeamBuilding",

It comes down to this 👉 most pieces of tech only solve one part of the whole experience in real estate. \n\nOne app might be great at leasing while another has specialist tools for maintenance or repairs. \n\nThe reality is that it's incredibly rare to find the perfect tool (a.k.a. The Swiss army knife) in proptech. Instead, these tools are built for specific purposes, rather than being an all-in-one solution. \n\nThere’s another part to the story, which is the level of involvement an agency principal wants to have. I like to think about it in the same way I think about the question: “what am I having for dinner?”\n\nI could decide to run to the grocery store and prepare a home-cooked meal from scratch or I could use a service like Providoor or UberEATS to bring my meal to me. \n\nI could even hand over the entire experience to a chef and pay a bit more to eat out at a restaurant. \n\nThe same decisions need to be made by real estate agencies. Do you pick a tool that requires a high level of involvement from you, or do you pick a truly all-in-one provider that can deliver a top-notch service using a trusted solution?\n\nI think it all comes back to finding the right solution that can give you a guaranteed level of service the first time, every time. \n\n#Proptech #PropertyManagement #RealEstateTech",

If not, make sure to tune into Taron Egerton’s Tetris film (coming out on March 31st on Apple TV). \n\nI loved playing Tetris, even on my old desktop computer back in the early 1990s. \n\nThe concept is so simple and yet so entertaining. Manipulate a little block, slot it into place, and get the lines. And it's funny because it has so many parallels to where our team at :Different is as a startup at the moment. \n\nSince shifting our strategy just over six months ago, we've had to rebuild ourselves as a company at an earlier stage. And at this earlier stage, the biggest thing we need to do is move the needle on the things that matter. \n\nThis is a constant effort on focus - drop the lines off the screen. If we don't do it well, the blocks keep falling, the wall builds and we lose a life. As we do it well, the blocks come faster and faster but we've gotten better and better.\n\nTo do that, we need to ensure our systems, products, and processes are working like machines. And when we identify that they are not, we take action quickly and decisively. \n\nThis week, I shared this message with my team and left on this note: as we think about how we're spending our time, and what we're doing, having this focus is absolutely critical to know that we can win the game and level up.\n\n#Tetris #StartupInsights #Founder",

We cover what’s going well and what has room for improvement.\n\nPlus, it’s a platform for me to run the team through big-picture changes that are happening in the business. \n\nTake this example: when we made the switch to a B2B2C company, I used our All Hands meeting to walk the team through the ‘why’ of this decision. \n\nWe played on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and titled this next phase of our journey “Into the B2B2Cverse” (based on the fabulous movie, “Into the Spiderverse”). Then, we used this thematic goal to anchor our short-term focus areas and long-term ongoing strategy as a business. \n\nCompany comms do not have to be stiff and formal. In fact, using the right platforms to share messages like this is a powerful way to keep your team aligned and excited with where the business is heading. \n\nTake a peek at the goals we set, from a deck I presented at our All Hands meeting last year. 👀\n\n#Leadership #AllHands #ScaleupAustralia",

Tackling immediate deadlines are likely to take priority over long-term tasks, like building relationships with potential investors. \n\nI’m often asked about when you should start having conversations with investors as a founder. Obviously, the sooner the better. This gives you enough time to really spell out and articulate the vision you have for your company and what you’re working towards.\n\nBut your time is a finite resource. Building relationships with hundreds of investors take hours out of your week, and most of these meetings won’t lead to an investment. \n\n💡 My tip? Focus your time and energy on strategic relationships. \n\nIf you’re launching a product that’s unique and relevant to a specific industry, reach out to strategic investors in that space where you can present a rationale for partnership and investment. It’s not about getting the partnership immediately; that’s unlikely to happen. Rather, it’s about getting in front of people early so that when the need arises, you’ve already established a foundation.\n\nThe rest of your time can be spent building relationships with VC firms that might be a good fit for your company. Again, be selective and handpick VCs that have a very real reason to invest in your company (whether that’s because of shared values, their fund’s thesis, or industry). \n\nDon’t just pick the biggest names. Instead, focus your time on building meaningful relationships with investors who are going to deeply care about what you’re building. \n\n#Startup #VC #Investing #CapitalRaising",

But if you’re not spending your time actually doing those things, you might be setting up your time wrong. \n\nThis applies across all stages, whether you’re raising at Series B, working towards profitability or an IPO. \n\nFor me, one of the hardest things to let go of was product design. It took me a long time to hire someone to run our Product Management, and it wasn’t until I came back from maternity leave that I realised I really needed to find someone great to take over it. Fortunately, I did. \n\nI love product, it’s been my job for 20+ years. It was always going to be one of the hardest things to step away from. But I know it’s in very good hands, and that needs to happen for our business to continue to scale. \n\n#ProductManagement #Leadership #LeadershipTips",

If you don’t have the right vision, you can’t execute it properly. And how can you be expected to execute well when you don’t have ownership of vision? What happens after a product launches? Who’s ultimately responsible for making it successful? A product doesn’t end once it ships - that’s the just the beginning. \n\nBy splitting these functions into two roles there’s no way to tell if you’re building the right thing or how you should adapt and change along the way.\n\nDo you agree?

Has something genuinely changed in terms of the businesses’ goals or is this new idea something we didn’t consider properly before? \n\n💡 My tip? If new approaches or ideas crop up, go through the process of adding them to the roadmap and score them against the framework you’ve been using to date. \n\nHow does it stack up to the existing priorities you’ve identified? If it strongly compares and will add value and improve the company, then that could be a green light to proceed. \n\nRemember: make sure you’re sticking to the big-picture vision of what you’re building and work on initiatives that will get you there. \n\n#ProductManagement #ProductManager #PMInsights",

It just means you need to look for people that are hungry, excited by your vision, and ready to take the risk. 👀\n\nPlus, it’s important to learn how to speak about the opportunities your startup offers to candidates.

It makes sense: you’re further along in your startup journey.

So you need to be showing that you’re growing as a company, and that’s continuing to happen (a.k.a. you can’t be plateauing). \n\nThe other piece to remember is around dilution.

If you ultimately choose to raise VC or convertible debt, make sure you know what you’re signing up for. \n\nIn the world of VC, you need to have the ability to generate 10x (even 100x) returns. You need to make sure that money will help you do that (and that you actually want to achieve that level of growth). \n\nStay tuned for Part 2 of my Seed Fundraising Tips where I share my playbook for building a seed-round pitch deck and high-level business model. 👀\n\n#StartupAustralia #SeedRaise #FundraisingTips #VC",

I love it because it gets me out of my inbox and allows me to connect with my team instantly in real-time.\n\nBut my favourite addition from Slack’s product team is this: playful micro-copy. 💬\n\nRecently, I accidentally started a Huddle with a coworker and no one else joined the call. I realised my mistake and clicked out of the meeting very quickly.\n\nThen I noticed this funny message from Slack saying, “You’ve just had a Huddle for 0 minutes. A productive session, we assume.”\n\nI’ve also had this gem pop up when I’m the first to enter a Huddle: “Hey, we’ve automatically muted your microphone. Enjoy the tranquillity.”\n\nWhat stuck out for me is how Slack understands that being professional doesn’t have to mean being boring as a brand. 👏\n\nIt’s something I’m really passionate about embedding into what we’re building at :Different. We’re offering a fresh take on the way property management is done, and embracing a more relaxed, authentic brand personality allows us to forge our own path. \n\nDo you have any great examples of playful micro-copy you’ve noticed while using Slack? I’d love to hear them in the comments 👇\n\n#Slack #MicroCopy #ProductDevelopment",

So, we build tech to do the heavy lifting and free up time and space for our people to foster relationships instead. \n\nThat means more time for our Property Partners to do strategic, value-adding work like proactively conducting rental market reviews to ensure they’re setting the right price for rent (and managing those conversations when adjustments are needed). \n\nHere's a screenshot of how the feature works in our Owner App 👇\n\n#Different #PropertyManagement #Proptech #ProductManagement",

In my opinion, the solution itself isn’t the most important thing. What keeps people motivated is a clear understanding of the ‘why’ behind the problem we’re solving. 💭 \n\nNot only does this make the day-to-day of a sprint easier, but it gives your team a clearer picture of what success looks like and how to measure it, too. \n\n#ProductManagement #Leadership #TeamManagement #PropertyManagement",

It gives me the ability to speak the language of our engineers and know different ways to approach a solution. \n\nWith a technical background, it’s easier to critically analyse how things are being built and understand how everything fits together. \n\nBut a degree isn’t your only option.

Keep the big picture in mind. 🧠  \n\nI’ve found it is much easier to think about what team structure you’re ultimately working towards and plan your hires with those levels of ownership in mind. \n\nIn the early days (e.g. when you’re hiring your first couple of Product Managers) it can be easy to handle delegation on the fly. \n\nBut as your team grows, not having clear lines of ownership can make it tough for your team to own what they’re doing and prevent team members from overlapping on the same tasks. \n\nI’m not talking about setting up siloed teams based on types of products - I’d never recommend splitting up work based on mobile vs web 👎. \n\nIt's really important to make sure you’re thinking about building areas of ownership in a product team that are built around #CustomerExperiences and workflows, rather than a technical platform 👍\n\n#ProductManagers: what team structures have you found really effective, and why?

In my investor roles, I want to see that a founder has the ability to learn, adapt and iterate - all within the context of the larger problem they’re trying to solve. When they invariably get things wrong, will they be able to make the right decisions to get to the right outcome?\n\nI’d also encourage you to come to investor meetings armed with:\n👉 A mock-up, prototype, or first iteration of whatever you’re trying to build. \n👉 A clear view of how you intend to make money (even if it's just a basic revenue model).\n👉 A unified vision for the big picture: what is the problem in the world that you’re trying to solve? Why does it need to be solved? \n\nIn my opinion, it’s not enough to simply find a gap in the market. I think it’s more important to look at the reverse and ask if there's a market in the gap.  💭\n\nIn other words, does the problem matter enough that people are willing to pay for it, and pay enough to make it a viable business? \n\nLet me know if you’re planning to raise in the comments and what fundraising tips you’d like me to share next. \n\n#VC #Investor #Startup #PreSeedRaise #VentureCapital",

    "Maren Kate Donovan's post 2mo ago": "It’s an unsettling time for knowledge workers as AI continues to automate and replace tasks that once demanded a human touch. Personally, I don't think we should let that fear overshadow the entrepreneurial possibilities of this moment in time - I believe now is hands down the best time to rethink becoming your own boss.\n\nSmall businesses aren’t going anywhere. Even with the rise of AI, people still need things that truly help them live better lives. That demand is constant. As a small business owner, you become the master of your destiny. You create the culture, you set the tone, and you define the future of your business.\n\n**AI Levels the Playing Field\nOne of AI's greatest upsides is that it enables individuals to carve out their own path without a massive team or mountains of capital. You can harness modern technology to lower costs, boost productivity, and scale in a sensible way. By leveraging contractors, vendors, and offshore labor, you keep your burn rate low while still delivering high-quality offerings.\n\n**Choosing the Right Path\nEntrepreneurship doesn’t have to be about building a billion-dollar exit. It’s about creating a life where you love your work, can comfortably support yourself (and your family), and serve your community. Whether you decide to start from scratch or acquire an existing small business, the goal remains the same:\n\n- Enjoy Your Work: Build a business you look forward to growing every day.\n- Support Yourself: Replace—or even surpass—your current income while building a valuable asset.\n- Serve Others: Focus on goods or services that actually solve problems and meet enduring needs.\n- Leverage Your Talents: Do what you’re good at and outsource the rest, whether to people or technology.\n- Contribute to Your Community: Create employment opportunities that share these same values.\n- Generate Long-Term Value: Make your business matter for the long haul.\nMaking Real Impact, Not More Noise\n\nAsk yourself: Can you replace your W2 income by becoming an entrepreneur? The answer is yes—if you seize the moment, embrace the tools at your disposal, and dare to create something that matters. Now is truly the best time to break away from the corporate “doom loop” and forge your own path into the future.",

TL;DR: Use ChatGPT (https://lnkd.in/e3-jqr8i) in the following ways as the first step:\n\n**Use ChatGPT for resume writing** provide it with your current resume, and it will use NLP to identify areas of improvement - especially if you share target jobs or industries you are looking at getting hired into. It can also suggest specific changes to make your experience and skills stand out to said employer group.\n\n**Use ChatGPT for LinkedIn profile optimization** Drop your LinkedIn profile URL into ChatGPT + ask it to analyze your profile and suggest changes that can help you get noticed by recruiters and hiring managers. Again, the more information you can provide, with examples, or jobs you want to be interviewed for, the better. It can suggest keywords that are relevant to your field, and make suggestions for updating your headline, summary, and experience sections.\n\n**Research job descriptions with ChatGPT** Use it to research job descriptions across a few interesting fields/spaces. This will help you understand the specific skills, experience, and qualifications that employers are looking for in candidates, then you can reverse architect your resume + LI profile to better match (via their algorithm) with these types of roles. \n\n**Use ChatGPT for cover letter writing** If you are applying for jobs that require a cover letter, use it to generate ideas for your cover letter. Drop in the job description and any other relevant information, and the AI can suggest specific content and structure that (it thinks) will make your cover letter more effective.\n\nWord to the wise, use this as a FIRST step, be sure to edit, use your human brain to gut-check anything the AI suggests. But I guarantee you 95% of job seekers are not using this technology at all, and it can provide a huge lift in your job search efforts if used correctly and in conjunction with networking and personal relationships.",

    "Maren Kate Donovan's post 3yr ago": "Five years ago, we started Avra Talent, which over the half-decade has evolved into a recruiting firm focused on helping remote-friendly startups (usually Series A or B) make 5 to 50 key hires. Every year, we’ve niched down and become more specific in what we do and who we serve ~ and it’s working, which is lovely.\n\nThat being said, there is still a big gap in the market, whether you’re a solo founder trying to build out a team, or FANG spin-off who needs to hire 100 engineers a quarter — almost every company we interact with isn’t prioritizing outbound sourcing.\n\nSo... what exactly is outbound sourcing? And WHY is a vital, and overlooked part, of every hiring campaign ~ you can read more here: #recruiting #talent #hiring #sourcing",

I'm speaking at an event about the 'Abundance' movement and would be grateful if you could join. \n\nBuilding more housing is existential to America right now, and the Ezra Klein/Derek Thompson book is the talk of the town. I have the great honor of being on a panel with Carter Malloy - the CEO of Acres, and Isaac Abid - the Founder of Lakeside group, about what's it's going to take for us to build more in American cities. \n\nThe panel will be moderated by Laura Foote, whom recently held a conversation with Derek Thompson from The Atlantic about the bestselling book. \n\nWhat are some topics around housing we should consider discussing at the panel? Would love your feedback, and hope to see you at the event - RSVP link in the comments.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1mo ago": "There is a lot of commentary on tariffs, but what I'm most worried about at present is how it will affect the rebuilding efforts in SoCal post-fires (and by extension, the devastation in North Carolina and Tampa).\n\nBetween Altadena, Palisades and Malibu, the cost to rebuild an individual home could range anywhere between $750k to $2M. Anywhere between 30%-40% of that cost is currently foreign-sourced material (a great chunk of which comes from China). \n\nWhile some materials can be purchased from domestic or alternative suppliers, U.S. capacity to produce steel, specialized glass, and high-quality lumber remains ill-equipped for large-scale rebuilding efforts. It's just not going to be easy to switch away from imports. \n\nTo put it into a plain and easy-to-understand perspective, if an insurance policy covers $750,000 in Altadena but actual reconstruction costs rise to $900,000, homeowners face a $150,000 shortfall. This is adding insult to injury for so many who are just trying to rebuild their lives at the moment. \n\nThere's also a significant risk of project delays since many contracts may have to be re-bid. I included some back of the envelope math on what I think costs could rise to, but I'd be curious if anyone has a stronger perspective on this.\n\nDoes anyone know what CA, or any other states are doing about this that have recently experienced disaster (North Carolina, Florida, etc)? I'd be really curious to hear from the followers I have on here who are in the homebuilding industry.",

I wasn't there, but I heard about it and apparently, the audience reaction was positive.

Zac is long been someone I admired and knows this space better than anyone on the planet. Plus he's just a great guy to be around. \n\nWe had our team offsite this week, and introduced a couple of new team members - including Erich Douglass whom we managed to recruit away from DoorDash. \n\nLast, we are hiring for two roles:\n\nProduct Manager\nData Scientist\n\nIf you know people passionate about the intersection of business, local government, and AI I want to speak to them.\n\nI'm grateful for my team - advisors, investors, family, and friends for supporting me this week and every week.

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 2mo ago": "DOGE will affect your city, and it's likely coming sooner than you think.\n\nThe agency plans to cut roughly $2T from the Federal budget. I’ve been digging into what that might mean for cities—specifically those under 500,000 people (since we think about that a lot in the context of Hamlet). I'm hearing rumblings about many discretionary grants are about to be gutted in the coming days. \n\nFederal grants, totaling $988 billion to states and $133 billion to localities in 2021, aren’t de minimis(they can comprise 20%-40% of some city budgets). \n\nDOGE’s early moves—like slashing $10 billion in grants by February 2025—target programs like HUD’s Community Development Block Grants, FEMA relief, and education aid. For a city like Camden, NJ, a 32% cut ($27M of an $85M budget) are significant. \n\nGreenwich, CT, might lose 15% ($22M of $150M), denting community projects.\n\nThese cuts are going to affect many cities, regardless of location, or wealth. Aspen, CO (18% at risk) and Reading, PA (26%) both lean on federal dollars—one for sustainability, the other ostensibly to stay afloat. \n\nA 28% hit to Flint’s $70M budget might save millions federally but cost billions in long-term decay—economic, social, human. Data from past cuts (e.g., 2012 CDBG reductions) shows distressed cities recover slower, while affluent ones pivot. \n\nCities are going to have to diversify revenue quickly in the event this plays out the way it could. \n\n(A couple of quick notes on the analysis - it's based on 2023 budget data, which I just increased by 3% per annum. Estimated federal grants as a percentage of budgets using Census intergovernmental revenue data - 2021 avg: 27% of state/local revenues -  and city-specific reports. Smaller, economically distressed cities often rely more heavily on grants -30-40% in some cases). \n\nThis analysis isn't perfect or precise, but it's meant to give you a sense of what might be coming.",

And to the rest of the Startup Zone advisory committee including Christopher Langford, and Jenna Louie. \n\nGreat job to Lindsey Norton and Morgan Mackles for holding down the Hamlet booth. \n\nAnd yes, the conference acronym is in fact IBS, which is aptly named since I get nervous before big pitches like this.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 3mo ago": "While the Federal Government has come more into focus in recent days (DOGE, etc), it's the local government that's starting to matter more and more for the future of the country. And where all of us should be focusing our attention. Your City Managers and City Council matter more than ever and will make decisions that impact your day to day lives. \n\nPretty much all I think about at Hamlet is local government and its impact on major issues in America - namely:\n\nHousing\nRetail Expansion\nRenewable Development\nFire Prevention/safety\nInsurance\nCommerce in general\nEducation/Schooling\n...the list goes on and on\n\nWhen I started this company 2 years ago, we begin with the simple idea that information at the local level and county level should not be so opaque. We've come a long way, but have much further to go.\n\nWe help customers with land acquisition, land development, retail expansion, and data center development - we also help governments share better information with residents (so they don't have to get information from social media). \n\nThe canonical startup advice you get as a Founder is to focus on solving one problem and solving it extremely well. But in the age of AI, I think that advice has to some extent been invalidated - if you don't seek opportunities along a broad aperture, the world will blow past you very quickly. \n\nWhat's coming next for us - we don't think you can build a large business as a data company alone - the insights you get from Hamlet will ultimately be what differentiates us...\n\nIf you operate physically in an American city, we can help you with our suite of products. Below is an example of how we can use AI to search a planning commission meeting for a specific mention of zoning - our customers view this as a massive time savings - to help understand where local officials and governments stand on any issue. We cover cities across the country, and have many more products beyond this now.... \n\nThe future looks bright - and we're excited to help American cities and businesses thrive.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 3mo ago": "While a lot of the attention has shifted away from Los Angeles over the past week or so, LA is still very much on my mind. I lived in and around the LA community for 8 years of my life - while at Claremont McKenna, UCLA and for some time during my professional career. \n\nI have friends who lost their homes and are trying to make sense of it all—and, more importantly, what will happen next. Many businesses I frequented while I lived there vanished in the span of hours. It's truly saddening. \n\nPublic officials have made many promises regarding recovery efforts, and it's our job to hold everyone accountable. But I also believe we shouldn't get this information from social media. \n\nAt Hamlet, our small contribution to the relief efforts - we are releasing our 'Search' product for free to a select group of users in the coming weeks. This will make it easier to search videos - using a combination of AI and public data - so you don't have to go to social media for the latest on what's happening. Don't get information a layer of abstraction away from the source - search directly from the source. \n\nWe are prioritizing journalists, city managers (who can use search to track recovery efforts), and those redeveloping in LA for this early release, but open to letting others (who are helping with the rebuilding efforts in LA), use the product. If you're interested in getting your hands on this, just comment on this thread and I'll respond over the next week or so. \n\nLA is an amazing place, and I hope for everyone affected that you're safe and sound. I'm confident it will be rebuilt stronger than ever before.",

I love writing at the start of every year - in part to hold myself accountable for all we want to accomplish, and to push the team to do our best. \n\nWhen I Founded Hamlet in 2022, I thought we would end up being a media company that would take public meetings, and turn them into useful newsletters for residents of small American cities. But a year into the business private companies and governments started expressing interest in paying Hamlet for information extracted from public meeting videos. \n\nAt the end of 2023 we had 3 paying customers - two private companies, and the City of Saratoga. In 2024, we ~10-xed revenue. I am setting an ambitious goal that we 5x again this year. Let's see where we sit when I write this update in January of '26. \n\nProduct wise - I'm not going to share much about where we are headed yet, but let's just say I am excited for a few big unveils in Q1... \n\nWe've processed tens of thousands of hours of public meetings across hundreds of cities, but there is a ton more work to do. Most of our customers are now real estate developers. But many more companies have reached out to us to track public meetings for different purposes (data center development, energy development, retail expansion, government affairs/issue tracking). Hamlet's ability to process video, and turn the meetings into structured data can help a vast array of customer types without having to change anything about how the product works. The TAM is massive.\n\nLarge cities and states have a robust lobbying apparatus with plenty of information floating around about how to get things done. But most American cities and Counties are not large - Hamlet helps our customers keep the commerce engine flowing everywhere in America by making public information less opaque. And we help governments share information with their residents so they do not have to use social media to receive news. \n\nWhat excites me the most about what we're doing is that it's truly original. We aren't taking PDFs and documents and building a RAG app on top of them. We aren't taking data that already exists and repackaging it to be something new. We believe to be a truly sustainable company in the age of AI, you have to take unique and original approaches - otherwise, you'll be too easy to copy. \n\nI love the moments when our customers remark that they haven't seen anything like what we're building - and that we can really help save them time.\n\nIf you're up for seeing a demo and have feedback for us, reach out - we are always trying to get better, and I'm optimistic for the year ahead. It will be challenging, but rewarding - thanks to our customers for the constant feedback, to the team for all the hard work, and to our investors/advisors for believing in us.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 4mo ago": "For those not terminally online - there has been a fiery debate on X (formerly Twitter) about H1B visas that was spurred by the appointment of an AI advisor - Sriram Krishnan - to the new administration. The debate turned ugly when new DOGE head, Vivek Ramaswamy posted a controversial post covering the shortfalls of American culture (I do not endorse his point of view). \n\nTensions have reached a boiling point, with overt racism being directed at Indian tech workers (I'll spare you the browsing and share an example below). \n\nI thought I'd spend a moment sharing my family's immigrant story and how it ties into what I think is the greater vision for America. \n\nMy dad moved here in '67 to study a very specialized field at the time - he was very technical and couldn't further his studies in India based on what was offered in those days. He was the top statistics student in his class and left his family with their entire life savings ($100). He was the youngest child in his family, and took a chance on America leading him to a better life. Eventually, he and my mother moved here in '71 together and settled into Northern California. While growing up in NorCal, I met folks like DJ Patil, Ryan Panchadsaram, Prakash Janakiraman and countless others. \n\nIt was in CA where I was born, along with my older sister. My sister went on to become a scholarship D1 athlete, and a broadcast journalist. I went to high school in Ohio - an all-boys, predominantly-white prep school called University School. Since then, I've been a serial tech entrepreneur and investor with some other stops in the industry along the way. \n\nI have to believe that my parents' outcome is what America wants out of immigration policy. They didn't come here with the thought we should leave after a year. They built here. My cousins who moved here are building here and love this country. Sure - we have our own Indian communities that we interact with, but we have built real roots here across many communities. I have to believe this is the America our Founding Fathers envisioned. \n\nThe idea that Indians, or any other ethnic group for that matter have malicious intent to 'replace white jobs' is disingenuous. We want to build here, and support America in whatever capacity we can. We love this country. Equally unhelpful is the discourse that we are ‘skilled labor’ here to do engineering jobs. We are not breathing machines for our fingers to type code, and I don’t think the tech community advocating for us in that particular way is helping. \n\nI hope the online discourse about Indians' intent to 'replace white jobs' dissipates. Indians, like any other ethnic group, view America with awe and aspiration. We are not machines whose parents deprived us of 'Saved by the Bell' as Ramaswamy suggests on X. Instead, we want to help America maintain its technological advantage (or whatever other field we contribute to) for decades to come.",

It's pretty hard to keep up on all the companies, the jargon, and what you should know so I thought I'd leave this here as a very basic primer for those wanting to know the basics (and some of the major companies). \n\nOf course you should do your own research on all of this, and not treat this as a canonical source of knowledge. But at the very least, I hope it spurs your interest to do a few Google (or Perplexity?) searches to learn more. \n\nEnjoy, and of course let me know if you have any feedback or edits. \n\nData Collection & Preparation is the foundation – imagine building a library for an AI to learn from. Companies like Scale AI and Weights & Biases are creating tools to curate and label massive datasets with the precision needed for effective learning.\n\nPre-training is where AI learns its fundamental understanding – similar to how we learn basic reading comprehension before specializing in specific subjects. This is where companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google teach models to understand patterns in language, images, and code.\n\nFine-tuning transforms this general knowledge into specialized expertise. A doctor builds on their medical school foundation to become a specialist. AI does similar things. Companies like Cohere and AI21 Labs focus here, adapting base models for specific industries and use cases.\n\nDeployment & Inference is about making these systems practical and efficient – turning  the scientific breakthroughs into everyday tools. Companies like Groq and CoreWeave are revolutionizing how these models run in production.\n\nApplications are where we interact with the end product of all of this. You may use Clay for marketing, perplexity for search, and the thousands of other companies that are building on LLM infrastructure. This is likely where you are spending the most time - and probably requires its own set of diagrams.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 5mo ago": "There's a tendency on LinkedIn for people to assume things are always up and to the right in startup land. Social media is deceptive in that way - LinkedIn can be a strange combination of self-promotional content mixed with hustle-culture platitudes. \n\nI am 2 years into Hamlet and while I'm excited about the way things are going, we still have a lot to figure out. Here's an honest assessment of some of the things that keep me up at night:\n\nKeep existing customers happy. We now have more than a dozen customers, and while they seem to love us, you're always worried about the things you *don't* know. What better questions could we be asking to truly understand what we should be building and what we should be doing? \n\nAre we approaching Product-Market Fit? When I was working on company 1 10 years ago, I assumed we had product market fit because we were generating 10s of thousands of revenue, then hundreds of thousands. Then millions. But the reality is revenue is *not* an indicator as to whether you have product-market fit. I can be a nice sign, but you could also be building toward a local maximum that's constrained and not valuable. I think we're getting there, but still many questions to ask, and to be answered.\n\nScale. Are we building processes that can scale to 100 customers? 1000? This applies to every area of the company - growth, product, engineering, ops. I want to build a big business, and the bottleneck is constantly shifting. If we have to build a new product for every customer - or if we have to build a lot of services to keep customers happy that's just not necessarily going to work at the early stage. \n\nTeam. Are our existing team members happy (team members, you don't have to comment on this on LinkedIn) and do they have the resources needed to succeed? Do I have a hiring pipeline for the next 10 key hires I need to make if we continue to scale and do well? \n\nAn ask for help. If you know real estate developers, data center developers, or gov affairs professionals who are willing to talk to us, I'd be grateful for any intros. Also, if you have any perspective on the above problems, please comment! \n\nStartups are not all positive and rosy - don't believe the posts. We still have a lot to figure out as I'm sure many Founders reading this can relate to. With that being said, I'm having fun, and I love solving problems like this. And part of the fun of building startups is the community of Founders around you who constantly support you.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 5mo ago": "Yesterday I hit 300 classes at Orangetheory. It’s one of those things that may strike many as a stupid accomplishment but it means something to me. I was at a really low point career and life wise when I first set foot in an OTF studio. \n\nThe coaches here helped me turn it around and rediscover how good it feels to actually take care of yourself. And by extension I found my way back to where I want to be career and life wise. \n\nIt really is incredible how much both mental and physical health affect your career. If you believe you can do hard things physically, it translates to other areas. My advice to Founders is not to ascribe to the hustle culture that promotes 17-hour work days - you have to take care of yourself first to be your best. \n\nAs a fun aside - I became friends with my first coach, and helped him transition from OTF to an amazing career in SaaS - he's doing an awesome job at his current company! \n\nMy goal is to resume coming in a few days a week starting now. If anyone is in the Bay and wants to join me please let me know. \n\nA little embarrassed that I’m sweating like a pig in this picture but it was a hard one today.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 5mo ago": "Hamlet turned 2 today. And I have a Thanksgiving request for anyone who might read this:\n\nPlease watch 30 minutes of one City Council meeting in your city with your families. \n\nThe origin story of Hamlet dates back to a City Council run I made in 2022. I don't have any political aspirations - we'd just moved to the East Bay and I wanted to get more involved with the community. I didn't raise any outside money - I mostly just talked to people about what they think local government should do. I didn't win, but I decided to start Hamlet. \n\nSo much information is buried in local public meetings and documentation that are vital to the basic function of our economy. Around $2 TRILLION dollars flows through local governments annually, which is a little less than 10% of annual GDP.\n\nWhen we decide to live in a city, we sign up for a basic social contract - that the city will continue to improve, and city officials will make decisions that are in our best interests. In most cases, our city managers and constituents in the community do an outstanding job. In other cases, some cities may be resistant to commerce, development and other issues. The point is - you shouldn't get this information from social media - it's worth spending a few minutes discovering what's going on for yourself.\n\nUltimately, Hamlet wants to be at the center of the $2T local commerce engine in America. We want to make it easier for businesses to operate, and for governments to work with businesses. We currently sell products to Governments (including Saratoga and Palo Alto) and Real Estate Developers that make it easy to turn public meetings into data. Ultimately, our vision is much bigger, which we'll share more about in coming months.... We now have over a dozen customers and we're growing fast.\n\nWe all ultimately benefit if we understand what's truly happening in our cities - please watch a meeting - I promise you'll learn something new.",

Reaching 5 employees felt great. Crossing great ARR milestones always feels good. Getting outside investors to believe in the company felt really cool. But the little things matter too - the office sign creates a sense of permanence, that we're here to stay, and we still have a lot of work to do. \n\nIf you're a fellow Founder - please don't forget to celebrate the small things.

Here are a few reasons why you should care about your local elections:\n\nLocal government manages $1.6 TRILLION dollars of annual expenditure and employs over 10% of the workforce in America. Voter turnout at the local level is generally between 15-25%. \n\nMany small towns actually struggle to fill council and commission vacancies because there just aren't enough candidates. \n\nOnly 6% of all council members are under the age of 35\n\nFewer than 30% are women, and the other diversity stats are pretty alarming.\n\nIn some cities, we get the same people running over and over again - there are cases in large cities where the Council Member has literally served 16 out of the last 24 years.... If you want change, it starts at the local level.\n\nAnd the craziest part? Though these are volunteer positions, Councilmembers raise a ton of money in some cases (which means outside interests definitely care who operates in your city council....). With one of our interns, I was able to pull an extensive amount of campaign finance docs across the state of CA. Below is just a snapshot of the amount raised in 9 cities.\n\nLarge donors to city council candidates include:\n\nPACs\nUnions\nEnvironmental Orgs\n\nThe list goes on. Please vote for the Councilmembers who help your city move ahead, and do your homework as you would for any other candidate. \n\nYour city is a place where your vote actually matters, and the future depends on you.",

It was really invigorating (done w/speaking for the year, I can now go back to being a fierce introvert)! \n\nI'm reminded that attending Claremont McKenna College was one of the best decisions of my life. Most people outside of the West Coast aren't as familiar with CMC, but it was recently ranked one of the 5 best collegse in America by the Wall Street Journal, just behind Stanford, Princeton, and Yale. \n\nA lot of the reason I pursued entrepreneurship was due to the influence of the people around me at CMC. Ashwin Navin- Co-Founder of Bit Torrent was a couple of years ahead, but someone I consider a close mentor. While I attended CMC there were just so many amazing people to learn from - David Enrich who is now a prominent writer for the NYT/best selling author was someone whose dorm room I would just show up at randomly. \n\nOther CMC alums over the years include: Henry Kravis and George Roberts (Founders of KKR), Steve Bullock (Governor of Montana), Doug Peterson (the CEO of the S&P), and Thomas Pritzker (Executive Chair of Hyatt). \n\nI want to thank Miles T. Bird for moderating, and for all the work he does to keep the CMC Network ahead of the game in the startup world. If you're a Claremont Colleges alum, and want to raise for your startup - go to StoryHouse Ventures first.",

If you've been even casually following the news, you're likely aware of the Springfield, OH situation and how a social media post turned into national news - and eventually a serious situation for the City Manager. \n\nMy plea to local government, and City Managers in particular, is to avoid this type of situation by proactively turning your public info into consumable media for your residents. It's now easier than ever for a city to turn into its own media company, by summarizing crucial information (and being proactively transparent). \n\nYou can work with Hamlet, or other companies like us to get there.

Going into dog ownership, we got all the typical advice pushing against it (it's a lot of work/they are like another kid/etc), but went ahead with it anyway. One year into it - no regrets - it has been a tremendous joy.\n\nIf you can support your local shelter, please do. Even if you don't adopt a dog (there are many in need), a donation goes a long way to keep some of these innocent, intelligent creatures alive. \n\nMowgli was found on the streets of Fresno, where a previous owner had likely abandoned him. When he was found, he had a busted ear drum, had 6 teeth extracted, and had a severe eye infection (for which they had to remove one of his eyes). He is about as sweet as they get, is calm, and has been such a positive presence for our family. No matter how stressful the day gets, there he is, just watching out for us peacefully. \n\nWe know little about his age, but think he's around 7. He's part Lhasa Apso, Havanese, Maltese and Shih Tzu. We did an Embark 'genetic' test and discovered he has an Uncle 'Chompy' in Bellingham, WA whom we hope to visit someday (along with some of his cousins in the San Diego Area). \n\nThere are many causes to support in the world but definitely think about your local dog shelter at some point. If you visit one this weekend, you may just walk away with a new family member.",

Home ownership is out of reach for most, and rents have been skyrocketing for years. \n\nThis used to be a pretty controversial topic a few years back, but now it's pretty popular/agreed across bipartisan lines that we need to build more. Some progress has been made, but we have a very long way to go. \n\nTo meet CA's state housing requirements, we'd need to build ~200,000 units per year (we are producing ~90,000 units per year). Without comment on whether CA's policy is correct here, I will say that we need to find a way to build more - in every region of America so the generations after us can afford to live here.\n\nI am excited to share that I'll be speaking at Blueprint 2024 about how Hamlet is planning on helping here. I've been quiet about what we've been up to, but let's just say there's a lot of information at the City Council and Planning Commission level of American cities that can help city officials and developers collaborate on building more in America.\n\nLet me know if you'll be at the conference - hope to meet up!",

But one conference that I will attend every time is Fortune Brainstorm Tech, which I had the pleasure of joining the past few days in Utah.\n\nWhat I love about Brainstorm: it’s well run, well moderated, and the speakers are off-the-charts excellent. It’s a rare conference where you actually have the opportunity to meet lifelong friends. This year was the first time I attended in 10 years, in part because I am very curious about where we are headed with AI. \n\nAnd the conference didn’t disappoint - we got a glimpse into not only the near future with AI, but the far future. We heard from the Founder of Runway about the future of Hollywood and Creative. We heard from the CEO of Wiz about the prospect of a Google Acquisition and his long term future vision for the company. We heard about how companies are actually using AI today and what they see in the near term future (from the CTO of Wipro, Adobe, and others). And we heard a lot about the fundraising environment and where investors believe value will accrue in AI long term.\n\nKudos to Andrew Nusca  and Maryam Banikarim 🗽🚕 ❤️  for putting on a perfect conference. Pictured - I met Clara Shih  when we were both Series A Founders 10 years ago, and we remained friends over that time. Here we are 10 years later - she is now the CEO of Salesforce AI. The activities interspersed throughout the conference were awesome - I was fortunate to take the pickle ball championship, which I consider my greatest career accomplishment to date :). \n\nIt was all capped off on day 2 with an awesome performance by musician/entrepreneur Aloe Blacc  \n\nNow I want to take these ideas and channel some of them into Hamlet. LMK if you’d find a write up of some of my takeaways valuable!",

In coming months I'll be sharing more about what we're up to, but it has been an interesting journey since we formed the company in November of '22. \n\nI thought we were building a media company. We were taking long and arduous City Council and Planning Commission meetings and summarizing them. We thought we would create a series of local newsletters for every small city in America, so residents could get better information about where they live.\n\nThen other customer types started reaching out and Hamlet became a B2B company.\n\nGovernments and Private companies use Hamlet data. Governments - such as Saratoga, CA and Palo Alto, CA work with us to summarize meetings on an ongoing basis, so they can share information with their residents. Private companies use us to extract key information and data from City Council and Planning Commission meetings. We will be doing a big product unveil around this in September. \n\nIf you are following local issues in small American communities, we can help. If you are a City Manager, we can help.

I had a chance to ask him a few questions on the heels of his fundraising announcement (he just raised $35M from Accel, A16Z and a host of others).

If authentic, the significance of this cannot be understated - it would be as if Coke had its formula revealed to the public for the first time. The piece of the leak that's missing is how each factor is weighted, but to me, these are the most important takeaways:\n\nWhitelisting:  Google has employed whitelists during major events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, elections) to control the visibility of certain websites in search results.\n\nE-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness): Although publicly emphasized, the leaked documents show minimal direct evidence of E-E-A-T influencing rankings.\n\nChrome Data Integration: Google's Chrome browser was created to gather full clickstream data, which significantly influences search rankings.\n\nNavBoost & Click Data Utilization: Contrary to Google's public denials, internal documents confirm the use of click data (long vs. short clicks) to improve search result quality, a system called NavBoost.\n\nIf you're building a new site, and you're a small business, it feels like the SEO arbitrage opportunity you think you have is more than likely no longer available. There's sure to be more extensive reporting on this in coming days, but if you're marketing anything right now, you should probably read up on this and have a discussion on how you allocate budget. It turns out the money you are spending on SEO/SEO firms may no longer be effective....",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "PPC and SEO are dead. If your company relies on both as primary marketing channels, and you aren't already talking about what's next, you should probably get together today. \n\nIf you haven't been living under a rock, you are likely aware that:\n\n1. Google is widely rolling out AI Overviews to all search users, which deprecate organic search results.\n\n2. Open AI released a new model earlier this week, which makes multimodal search (i..e voice search) easy and fun (separate note, Apple should be embarrassed that Open AI effectively made Siri obselete in no time at all). \n\n3. Generally, users are gravitating more and more toward tools like Anthropic, GPT-4o, Perplexity and others for search. This trend is only going to accelrate.\n\nSo as a marketer, what should you do? Is all hope lost? Absolutely not, there are a million things you can and should be doing right now. An abbreviated list - all of which can be expanded into their own 500-word posts:\n\n1. Text is not the only channel that works. Focus on other forms of media for acquisition - people absolutely love streaming. Hulu and others are introducing new ad-unit types - is your brand transferrable to image/audio and other forms of media? If it isn't, make sure it is right away.\n\n2. Invest in Brand - but by that I don't mean hire agencies or an expensive Chief Brand Officer. It is now cheaper and easier than ever to use some of the existing AI tools to build iconic brands. More important - it is easier to 'be everywhere' thanks to AI. I have a million ideas on this, which I'll share in a future post. \n\n3. Influencer marketing will still work, but not the way you think - AI influencers are going to become a thing. How can you build 10 of your own AI influencers to advocate for your brand, constantly post, and go after audiences you care about? With technology today this is completely feasible. The not-scaleable way of doing this is to just pay existing influencers to post on your behalf. \n\n4. Similarly - this is going to sound off the wall - but AI generated newsletters and podcasts are going to be a thing. You can now output 1 podcast episode a day easily using tools like Eleven Labs. Email newsletters are even easier - you'll need an editor to avoid inaccuracies and hallucinations, but AI generated newsletters that add value to users are also going to be a thing. \n\nThe list goes on, and it's different for B2B than it is B2C, but don't be paralyzed. Start somewhere today - this trend is inevitable, and being in denial about it won't help. The best companies will adapt, as they always do.",

I am an unapologetic, pro technology Silicon Valley based Founder... but it's pretty indisputable at this point that under a certain age, phones are just not good. \n\nRather than the normal moral-panic fare around this debate, the author dives really deep and provides a more thoughtful analysis around the 'why'. An excerpt below:\n\n\"Social media is all about network effects. Most students are only on it because everyone else is too. Most of them would prefer that nobody be on these platforms. Later in the study, students were asked directly, “Would you prefer to live in a world without Instagram [or TikTok]?” A majority of students said yes––58 percent for each app.\n\nThis is the textbook definition of what social scientists call a collective-action problem. It’s what happens when a group would be better off if everyone in the group took a particular action, but each actor is deterred from acting, because unless the others do the same, the personal cost outweighs the benefit.\"\n\nI'm still left with the question - at what age is it appropriate to give a child a phone?",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "I toured the Apple Vision Pro earlier today. It's the single most impressive piece of technology I've encountered since the iPhone - but I'm not buying one....\n\nFirst - anytime a technology like this comes out, you get a chorus of naysayers who regale at the fact that this could end up being the next Newton, Juicero, or other long line of hardware failures. The Vision Pro is an achievement of American engineering - not a failure just by virtue of the fact it was released. \n\nI am confident that we will all be using this product by the time V3 or 4 come out. When the iPad first came out, it was widely panned - over half a billion iPads have now sold. Then - people made fun of the watch - which now sells over 50 million units a year. \n\nI've also tried other VR headsets - like the Oculus. And watched Zuckerberg's response video - the Oculus is not as good a product as the Vision Pro is. It's not even close, but that's a separate post for another time.\n\nThe screen is just flat out impressive - I promise you you've never experienced a screen like this in your life. The eye tracking - you can literally direct it which apps to open with your eyes - feels seamless. The way spatial video looks inside the headset is also unlike anything you've experienced with another tech product. \n\nOn the downside - you can definitely tell you are in a VR headset - the background/camera passthrough effect is noticeable. And you can feel the weight of it after 30 minutes or so.\n\nSo why won't I buy one? Aside from the obvious - price - is that frankly I'd feel weird wearing one around the house with wife, kids and dog staring at me wondering what I'm doing. It's an isolating experience. And after that 30 minute session - you do feel like you've been on another planet, and it takes you a while to reorient.\n\nOnce Apple nails the form factor, and figures out how to blend the 'real world' experience a bit more with the in-headset experience, then it's absolutely going to be the next great computing platform. \n\nAnyone who is interested in technology should at least do the tour to experience it - and the critics should take a look at it before flat-out dismissing it as pure hype.",

I ran a local publication in SF called The Bold Italic, which I sold to Medium in 2019. And at one time, I co-hosted one of the top 200 podcasts in the US. And with my new company, Hamlet, we spend a lot of our time thinking about using AI to demystify difficult to understand public info. \n\nIn the past year, we've seen a slew of media organizations and initiatives around saving local journalism and perhaps even the institute of journalism itself via AI. I believe the fundamental premise of this thought process is flawed - it implies we somehow need to make it cheaper to cover interesting information - when we likely need to be doing the opposite. \n\nSome interesting stats (source - SEM Rush):\n\nPictured - Buzzfeed's organic traffic at peak was 62M monthly uniques, it's now 1/6th that size.\nAlso pictured - Vice - which hit over 40M monthly organic visits, but is now 1/10th that size.\n\nAll the AI-enabled content in the world is not going to reverse that trend. Audiences are just not interested in what news outlets are offering - and it's become easier for any news outlet to generate commoditized content like sports scores, recaps of TV shows, or expand their Op-Ed section to incite flame wars and potentially produce a viral hit. \n\nWhat we need is for media organizations to decide where they are operating. Are you a high quality journalism outlet with high quality, well-researched content? Or are you selling citizen journalism? There is no room left in the middle anymore. \n\nThe Information is one of the best here - they picked an identity, and they are nailing it. Stratechery. The Verge (which produces the best device reviews to this day). On the 'low end' of the cost production scale, we need more individual contributors at the local level who can assume the role the newspaper used to play. Every small city will have 1-2 people who assume the mantle of taking on local content, and they can make good money in the process. \n\nWe don't need AI-generated content that's gamifying search, and further eroding Google's already declining search experience. \n\nWe need people who want to do the work.",

But lost in all of this is the significant competitive pressure they face from Anthropic - a well funded competitor with many Ex-OpenAi staff. \n\nWe've been very happy OpenAI customers at Hamlet, but Anthropic is catching up extremely fast. If you want to learn more about Anthropic, please read - and of course I'd welcome any and all feedback about the writing itself.\n\nSpecial thanks to Peter Darche for helping me put together some analysis, and to Maya Flores for reviewing drafts of this. \n\nWhat should I cover next?",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "We’ve been working extremely hard at Hamlet and working on a bunch of stuff. \n\nProud to announce that we launched our newsletters in another 372 cities across 15 new states today. So what exactly does that mean? \n\nHamlet uses public data and information to create a ‘landing page’ for cities. We then also use public data to create newsletters for each of these cities - focusing specifically on smaller cities in America where there may be no local newspaper (however, we aren’t a news organization). \n\nResidents discover the newsletters through a variety of mechanisms - search, social, etc and subscribe. Simultaneously, while we are building distribution in these cities, we are speaking to City Managers from all over America about summarizing critical information - like city council meetings - so they can direct their residents to a credible source of information outside of social media. \n\nThe foundational work that has gone into the past year is building a product that can scale to every city and special district in America, and create meaningful, valuable content for these cities. \n\nOur next phase, which is happening in parallel, is working with governments to create ‘hubs’ for the content they want to share with residents. We already have 3 paying customers at this point, and we’re talking to many, many more. \n\nAnd in search, for some cities we are already a first-page results, in some cases outranking sites like Compass, Redfin, and even the government website in rare cases. We have hundreds of subscribers in some cities. \n\nHamlet wants to turn public data into usable information so residents know how to ‘use’ their city. And for governments, we will save administrative time, and unnecessary headaches along the way. America should be easy to use. \n\nThanks to Leslie Bartley, Javier Perez, Alisha Aufai, Agustín Rodríguez and the rest of the team for the release of these new states and cities. We are still early, but all we can do is keep progress, momentum, and speed.",

There were almost 100 founders, or potential founders present and we obviously talked a lot about AI and its implications. I wanted to share a few takeaways on what I personally learned:\n\nThe quality of founders right now is very, very high. I've been actively investing in companies for a number of years - I've never been more impressed with the expertise and depth of thought founders are bringing to the table now. \n\nLiterally everyone is working on AI to solve different problems vertical-by-vertical.\n\nIn the past 2 months, I've seen about 10 companies working on tackling sales automation through AI, and many of them seem to have traction. Whether its sales training, SDR outreach, script generation.... across the board this is the area where I'm seeing the most activity (also seeing a lot in marketing right now). \n\nAnother hot area is mental health, where I've seen a number of companies pitch potential AI solutions for mental health ailments. My personal view is that this space is years away from being viable. \n\nIn a bizarre, perhaps more dystopian area - I have seen 2-3 companies working on helping people automate their responses using AI on dating apps. This is going to have some pretty interesting societal ramifications, but AI is being used to navigate social awkwardness, whether we like it or not. \n\nI'm excited to be working on Hamlet, but at nights and on weekends I'm still actively investing here or there (in about one company a quarter). If you're working on an AI company to solve a painful problem in a specific vertical, please reach out!",

For example - who do you call if a light it out at the public park? Or there is a busted fire hydrant? \n\nWe are creating one-pagers for every city in America containing vital information about your city and who to call or reach out to based on what you need.

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "I just spent a few days in Washington DC at Bloomberg City Lab - a conference which brings together mayors and city leaders from all over the world to talk about technology, innovation, and urgent issues affecting cities at the present moment. Between this conference, League of California Cities, and ICMA, I've talked to dozens of city officials over the past few weeks and the conclusion I've come to is - the most existential issue America faces right now is the housing crisis. \n\nBut the housing crisis isn't just about affordable housing (which we need more of). As is the case with all of these things, it's much more nuanced - I wanted to share some of what I heard while it's fresh in my head:\n\nFor some cities, it takes ten years from the time a new development is approved to the time it actually hits the market. That is unacceptably long. And contrary to what you might think, it's not just CA cities that are burdened by this - it's true all over the country.\n\nOne of the keys to solving homelessness - according to many cities - is to make sure someone who is on the streets is re-housed ASAP. And then provided with services to get them back on their feet. The longer the time someone spends on the streets, the more likely they are going to be there for a long time. This obviously intuitively makes sense, but we're unable to -- across America - solve this. Some cities want to use vacant high rises and hotels to help, but are facing administrative hoops and opposition. \n\nNew developments are happening.... but mostly in 'richer' areas where fancy retail can be built. Cities are using tools like density bonuses to incentivize the creation of affordable housing, but it's just not working. In CA the Housing Element has been widely panned by cities as the incorrect tool to get cities to build affordable housing. There has to be another way. \n\nLast - climate change is happening and cities are experiencing warmer temps. But existing buildings are not built for the 'new' climate. An example of this is the Pacific Northwest - which has traditionally been a safe-haven for extreme climate. In 2021 a heat 'dome' hit the region and many died as a result. This is because PNW homes don't have things like A/C, and cities don't have 'cool' places for residents to get rest from extreme heat. \n\nNext to housing, crime is the second issue cities are concerned about. But that's another post in and of itself, and inter-related to housing. \n\nGrateful to have had the opportunity to meet so many people over the past few weeks - here I am with Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. (who is an awesome leader). Special thanks to Thomas Goetz. \n\nNow I need a nap.",

One of our most oft-requested products is somehow making it easier to understand all communications that are coming from your local school. \n\nExamples of this might be:\n\nWhat days are minimum days? \nWhen do I have to sign up for parent teacher conferences? \nWhat day is the Halloween parade so I can make sure my kid dresses up in their Jack-o-Lantern costume? \n\nWe are exploring possible solutions to this, but it is completely technically feasible. My question is, if we could provide summaries of your public school calendars in easy-to-digest ways would you want them? And if yes, how would you want them delivered (email, SMS, Whatsapp)? \n\nThe next logical extension of this is city public calendars - so we can let people know when the Auto Show is, the Wine festival, or whatever other local events are interesting. \n\nWould enjoy your feedback! And of course if it's not a good idea, let me know. \n\nAt Hamlet we are constantly looking for way to make life easier for city governments - who are stretched thin and resource constrained, and city residents - who want to be engaged, but often don't have the time to read, or listen to extensive details.

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "Today I had the opportunity to speak at the International City Managers Association conference in Austin, TX about AI, and how small governments should consider using it in their cities.\n\nThe audience was primarily City Managers from all over America (over 5000 city officials were present at the conference). I cannot emphasize what an important role City Managers play in a functioning democracy - Mayors and Councils get the publicity, but City Managers execute on the vision. \n\nWhere you live, right now, here are an abbreviated list of responsibilities the City Manager takes on:\n\nOverseeing day-to-day municipal operations and implementing policies set by the city council\n\nPreparing and submitting the annual city budget for council approval\n\nHiring, supervising, and terminating city department heads and employees\n\nAdvising the mayor and city council on financial conditions, programs and needs of the city\n\nEnsuring delivery of city services to residents\n\nNegotiating contracts, permits, and agreements on behalf of the city\n\nRepresenting the city in meetings with community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders\n\nAddressing residents' concerns and complaints about city services\n\nCoordinating the city's emergency response in events of natural disasters or crises\n\nOverseeing infrastructure projects like road repairs, park upgrades, etc.\n\nPromoting economic development and growth in the city\n\nEnsuring the city follows all state and federal laws and regulations\n\nThe role of the City Manager is to make sure everything works - you only become aware of who they are if something is going wrong. But most of the time, no news is good news, and they keep everything running well. \n\nThe talk went well. Our aim at Hamlet is to make communication about the issues city managers take on much smoother - via council summaries, planning commission summaries, and other products (many of which we have in pipeline this coming year). \n\nThis will save City Managers administrative time - with people not pinging them about questions that are easily-answerable through these summaries. And it's good for residents - who won't have to rely on social media or urban legend to figure out what's going on in their city. \n\nIf you don't know who your City Manager is, you should find them and thank them!",

No phones until they are 30.... Ok, may not be able to pull that off, but in all seriousness knowing what I know about tech and how addictive it is for me personally - it feels like a bad idea to foist Tik Tok, Instagram and all the Internet has to offer to an emotionally developing adolescent.

I'm obviously not anti-technology - I had IRC as a kid in the 90s, and was introduced to the Internet at a young age (which I give a lot of credit to my parents for doing). The only differences are there weren't billions of users, mobile, social media and there are now many more nefarious actors with sophisticated techniques to scam kids.\n\nThe argument I hear against this position is that kids will feel left out because all of their friends organize gatherings, share location, and communicate using Snap, Discord, and other platforms. \n\nWould love some thoughts here.",

    "Sunil Rajaraman's post 1yr ago": "Well - the cat is out of the bag - we just announced our first customer at Hamlet: the City of Saratoga, CA.\n\nWhen I started Hamlet, the primary motivation was concern around how people receive information at the local level in small American cities - it's usually through word of mouth or social media. While I was a City Council candidate last year, it became apparent to me that there are a few people within small communities that emerge and typically control the entire narrative. I think this ends up being net bad for most American communities.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, people who do want to get involved with local government generally don't have time to attend 3-hour long city council meetings - especially after long days at work. But they do care.\n\nThe answer is to make government easier to understand for citizens - which is what Hamlet is doing. This is beneficial for the government - who no longer has to direct citizens to social media for information. And beneficial for the citizens - who want to know what's important and engage where they are needed.\n\nThe City of Saratoga is the first to share this vision, but we are talking to dozens of other governments about deploying Hamlet's 'Gov Center' product as an information hub for residents. But we will have much, much more to announce on the product side soon....\n\nDoes your small city (fewer than 100,000 residents) need easier-to-understand information? Please comment and I'd love to connect with your local government. And if you have feedback on the product, please share! We are always looking to improve. \n\nLast, if your'e a City Manager, I'll literally talk any time of day you're available - I'm a light sleeper, which is a great attribute for entrepreneurship (though not always beneficial for life in general).  \n\nThx to Leslie Bartley, Maya Flores, Alisha Aufai, Javier Perez, Rob Tyrrell and the rest of the team for doing great work to get our first customer live.",

Mayors and City Managers of several communities close to where I live (in the East Bay), expressed alarm around a growing number of disturbing incidents. I wanted to share - both to hear whether others are experiencing the same in their community - but more important - to hear any thoughts on how we can fix it. \n\nHere are some of the notes I took:\n\nRacist incidents in schools are increasing. \n\nCity Council meetings are being ‘zoom bombed’ in an organized fashion. During public comment, agitators appear to be using their open mic to express hate toward particular races or ethnic groups. \n\nBut what’s particularly insidious about it is after one commenter comments, several others follow suit with similar messaging - illustrating to city leaders a new level of coordination that they haven’t experienced before.\n\nIt’s not as easy as ‘cutting off’ commenters for a variety of reasons I won’t get into on this post.\n\nThe incidents are now transitioning to the real world. After one city experienced the aforementioned, groups were on the ground ready to distribute fliers expressing hate toward certain ethnic groups (for context, I received one of these fliers on my car when I was parked in another city).\n\nI think my main takeaway and concern is this - trolls used to hide behind the anonymity the Internet afforded them to be provocative and say awful things. They are now much more organized, well-funded, and don’t appear to care as much about social consequences of their actions.\n\nImmediately after the panelists spoke, at least 5 cities highlighted specific incidents that sounded eerily similar. \n\nAre you experiencing anything similar in your city? I want to share as much information as I can across city leaders I speak to to see if we can’t find a solution for this.\n\nThanks to  fellow CMC grad Ryder Todd Smith for encouraging me to attend this conference.",

About 15 people showed up to the event. \n\nA lot of interesting takeaways that I thought could be broadly interesting for anyone who lives in an American suburb:\n\nEveryone there was concerned about how divisive local politics is becoming - small issues have gotten significantly more contentious over the past decade\n\nMost residents view their relationship with local government as adversarial. They feel there isn’t common ground on interests, and expressed a general mistrust of how local gov handles issues. This is the main problem we are working on at Hamlet.  \n\nSocial media mistrust is at an all time high - one of the first things people asked us about Hamlet is whether we’re planning on selling our data to FB or nefarious data brokers.

Maya and I worked together at GoodRx, and she will be heading up marketing - Maya is the perfect person for this stage (to help us big strong inroads with American communities). \n\nWe’ve also released a ton of stuff over the past few weeks - one of the things we’re most excited by is the potential for AI to tell the stories of small American communities - with data. What do you think of our draft data visualization module? \n\nLast - if I can bug my awesome network for an ask - are any of you from Contra Costa, San Diego, or Orange Counties?

I have a bit of a conspiracy theory around it - I think it may be a growth tactic masked as a rebrand. \n\nI took a look at the top 50 organic search terms that are generating traffic to Twitter (excluding 'Twitter' and 'Twitter Search'). You'll notice two types of sites on here - corporates and.... pornography sites. People searching for pornography is a major, major traffic driver to Twitter, and with traffic in decline in recent months, Twitter may be in need of a boost. \n\nEnter X - we don't have good data on X, because presumably there are 'nofollow, noindex' tags on it, but we know from 2013 it was generating ~3M unique visitors a month. It's also a site with 3.5M backlinks. You can imagine a world in which traffic is tanking, that you need a quick shot in the arm - X provides that basically instantly - and aligns with what appears to be a major audience interest. \n\nThis would also explain why it happened so abruptly post threads - traffic was tanking and something needed to be done.\n\nAm I totally off base here? I may be, but would love to hear alt takes.  \n\n(Data Source: SEMrush)",

I found a dataset on Kaggle that takes some Spotify data over time for all of her songs and shows some pretty interesting trends. Here is one chart I came up with that I thought was interesting:\n\nThis analysis explores the evolution of Taylor Swift's music over time, focusing on two key musical characteristics - danceability and energy.\n\nDanceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n\nEnergy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n\nYearly Fluctuation: The danceability and energy of Taylor Swift's songs have fluctuated year by year - she is one of the most versatile artists we have.\n\nDual Trends: While some years showed a rise in both danceability and energy, others indicated a diverging trend, she experiments with new music quite a lot. \n\nEnergy Drop in 2012: Despite the high danceability in 2012, it was also the year with one of the lowest average energy levels in her songs.\n\n2008 and 2010 Variance: In 2008 and 2010, Taylor's music saw lower danceability, but a higher energy level compared to other years.\n\nContinued Evolution: Up to the latest data in 2023, Taylor's music continues to evolve, demonstrating her versatility and ability to experiment with different musical styles and elements.\n\nThe amount of data available out there for interpretation on the Internet never ceases to amaze me.",

Here goes:\n\nThere is a slight negative correlation between the year a movie was released and its IMDb rating, suggesting that older movies tend to have higher ratings. \n\nThe strongest correlation (0.49) was found between the number of votes a movie received on IMDb and its rating. \n\nDrama is the most common genre among the top 1000 movies, appearing in 72.4% of films. This is followed by Comedy (23.3%) and Crime (20.9%).\n\nAlfred Hitchcock has the most films in the top 1000 with 14, followed closely by Steven Spielberg with 13.\n\nThe actor with the most appearances in the top 1000 is Robert De Niro, with 17 films. He is followed by Tom Hanks (14 films), Al Pacino (13 films), and Brad Pitt and Clint Eastwood (12 films each). Meryl Streep appears 4 times, as does Jodie Foster and Sigourney Weaver -  with Ingrid Berman appearing 3 times. \n\nThe 'Runtime vs. IMDb Rating' scatter plot shows a general trend of longer movies having higher ratings.\n\nWhat's crazy about this analysis? It was done using code interpreter in about 5 minutes. It's basically turned everyone who has questions about data into Nate Silver overnight....",

I've gone from eating in a rush at my desk or at the airport to making home cooked, healthy meals for myself and my family. This shift has led me on a wonderful journey, discovering ways to diversify the foods we eat and maximize our fiber intake in hopes of creating a healthier, immune-boosting gut biome -- an absolute necessity with a six year old in the house. I've seen major improvements in my overall health with more energy, better skin and weight loss. Plus, I've leveled up my love of cooking, while finding joy in starting my own garden and joining our local CSA. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm a fan of fiber. \n\nSo when an opportunity came my way to be an advisor of Floura & Co. -- launched yesterday by the incredible entrepreneur Jeni Britton -- I was all in. Known for her ice cream empire, I've long been impressed by Jeni's commitment to quality and taste, as well as her impact on community and culture. Jeni started Floura to make it easy and delicious to close the fiber gap with real food that tastes great. Can you believe that most of us aren't even consuming half of the fiber we need each day?! \n\nFloura is the most concentrated diverse fiber bar on the market. And yes, it’s really good! As an added benefit, it uses ingredients like apple cores and fermented watermelon rinds to capture the healthy parts of food that otherwise go unused. Better for us and better for the planet! \n\nI love supporting founders on their journey and can't wait to see where Jeni and her team take Floura. Check out Floura and let me know what you think! My favorite flavor is Brambleberry Lavender.",

So much of what she took away from my speaking engagement at the University of Maryland in 2015 is still on point today. \n\nHowever, I guess I didn’t know Jeff P. would become such a significant fixture in my life. So I’d say that working through the “partnership what-ifs” with friends or family is worth it. Together, we’ve not only built a family, but also grew a business, advocated for change and continue to dream together. \n\nI can now say that there is something reassuring about having someone in your corner who you trust to help get you to the other side of just about anything – whether that’s a spouse, a parent or a friend.  \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eX7Wkn5H",

And then playing catch up, speaking at events, attending to board activities, hosting office hours and more. What did I learn during this time?\n\n-Taking time away is good for the mind and the soul – I came back refreshed and motivated in a very different way.\n-Many conversations and opportunities waited for my return (and I’m okay with missing those that didn’t).\n-When it comes to content, I don’t want to do content for content’s sake. I want to make it relevant and meaningful for you – and me.\n-The future is difficult to predict. Surveys and trends don’t always tell you everything you need to know.\n-Because of this, we need to be grounded in our own purpose and how we use our voice.\n\nWith this in mind, I’m going to be leaning into those aspects of leadership that have been quintessential to my success: shared experience, collaboration, community, education and optimism. I’ve always been a “couldn’t we just…” person and I’m going to be doubling down on this notion.\n\nSo look out for Office Hours where we’ll be bringing different voices to the conversation. Brands shout outs that offer a masterclass (or startup class) on building brands sustainably. And perhaps a favorite book or inspiring quote that gets us thinking about how we’re showing up in the world.",

As I mentioned to her, I'm proud to say that S'well started the movement by thinking differently about the role reusable bottles could play in our lives. What is happening now isn't a trend, but what I'd call a cycle -- a moment where reusables are re-emerging into the cultural dialogue. It's exciting and interesting to see how each cycle is different, which brand is on top and what is driving the conversation. As we move from this one to the next, I hope that the brands capitalizing on it can be intentional in standing for more, finding ways to not just talk about their bottom lines but the impact they are having on the planet and the people putting them on top.",

    "Sarah Kauss's post 2yr ago": "Happy Earth Day! Most people know that plastic pollution tops my list of issues we need to solve. I’ve participated in plenty of healthy debate about what solutions will work, and devoured article after article on the latest technologies trying to make real progress. But we all know steps like these will only take us so far. As business leaders and innovators, we must do more daily by committing resources — time, money, teams — to create the measurable change we want to see. \n\nWith this in mind, I encourage you this Earth Day to reflect on how plastics play a role in your business and what policies you can implement on a regional or global level to reduce them in your operations, day-to-day office settings and more. Then invest in putting those policies into action. \n\nAnd if you're not sure where to begin or what first steps to take, reach out to start a conversation.",

It was a life-changing experience that made water a central issue for me. The stats here and abroad today continue to illustrate the severity of the situation and the ongoing need for our support. In honor of World Water Day, I'm sharing a few stats from the UN and World Economic Forum. \n\nDid you know: \n\n2.2 million people in the US don't have access to running water and basic indoor plumbing, and two billion people worldwide don’t have access to safe drinking water. \n\nAlmost half of the world’s population is experiencing severe water scarcity during some part of the year. \n\nHigher water temperatures and more extreme weather are expected to increase water pollution with sediment, pathogens and pesticides. \n\nFewer than 50 countries have laws or policies that specifically mention women’s participation in rural sanitation or water resources management. \n\nBillions of people will lack access to basic sanitation and clean water by 2030 unless progress increases four fold.",

    "Sarah Kauss's post 2yr ago": "Happy International Women’s Day! \n \nI am a proud regional Board member and supporter of UNICEF and wanted to call out all that UNICEF is doing to change the world for girls and women. The progress is real. More girls are completing secondary school than ever before. Adolescent birth rates have fallen from 51 to 42 births per 1,000 adolescent girls since 2012. Child marriage rates are also falling, with South Asia seeing the biggest decline in the past decade – from 46% to 28%. \n \nWhile the lives of girls have undoubtedly improved in many respects, they still face unprecedented challenges. Nearly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are neither employed nor in education or training – compared to 1 in 10 boys. Hundreds of millions of girls worldwide are still subjected to child marriage and female genital mutilation – even though both have been internationally recognized as human rights violations. \n \nOn this International Women’s Day, UNICEF is also shining a light on nutrition. A new report from UNICEF, issued today, shows that more than one billion adolescent girls and women suffer from undernutrition. Undernourished and Overlooked: A Global Nutrition Crisis in Adolescent Girls and Women warns of the intensifying nutrition crisis, exacerbated by ongoing gender inequality. From the report, we also learn that that the number of pregnant and breastfeeding adolescent girls and women suffering from acute malnutrition has jumped 25% from 5.5 million to 6.9 million since 2020 in 12 countries hardest hit by the global food and nutrition crisis, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen.\n \nHere is a 90 second video that talks more about this crisis and how UNICEF is responding: One Billion Reasons for Better Nutrition.\n \nThe numbers show us that progress is possible. On this International Women’s Day and every day, UNICEF will continue fighting, investing and innovating until all girls have their rights protected and the opportunity to fulfill their fullest potential. THANK YOU to UNICEF for helping to build a more equitable future for girls and women everywhere.",

My point of view was simple – stay true to your brand, uphold your mission, innovate often and know your customers’ needs at every turn. These were my hacks to stay one (or maybe three) steps ahead of the people and companies who believe they have the right to ride the coattails of another brand’s success.\n\nTimes have changed over the last four years though and so have my views. Now I know this approach is only one piece of the puzzle. As this piece from Medium’s Stephanie Clifford highlights, S’well has had to partner with legal teams, Custom Border Patrol, vendors and retailers to fight the fakes. And even when we win, we lose...because the system is broken. There are too many people stealing from original brands’ playbooks with the world of copycats having grown too big and consumers at large too dependent on quick delivery at the cheapest price – losing sight or simply not knowing what is real and what is fake anymore.\nForever the optimist, I believe that along with legal and government support, we need to create a cultural shift in behavior. And we need to do this in solidarity with eachother – big retailers coming together with entrepreneurs and consumers to find a way to collaborate and educate for change. Who’s with me?",

Here's my response:\n\n“It can be trying going into a situation where you feel like you may already be at a deficit, but change that thinking. You're passionate about the service you’re providing and you believe in the expertise you're bringing to the table. Let this belief guide your process of reeling in new business. Feel out any concerns they may have by asking powerful questions. Their issues may have nothing to do with age and more about how you're positioning the company's successes. Focus your pitch and select the right successes (no matter how small) and make them sizzle. If they don't go with your company, ask them why so that you can refine your message. The young company, or age difference, might not be the issue at all. If you find out that it is, though, ask your current clients how they overcame that concern and home in on those winning features.”",

That’s where Ben and the Little Spoon team come in. What started as a mission to make healthy food more accessible has turned into a revolution in childhood nutrition. \n\nLittle Spoon is reshaping mealtime with fresh, organic, and convenient options, proving that kids deserve better food.

Seeing a packed room—filled with as many men as women—eager to learn, connect, and refine their approach to raising capital was truly inspiring. \n\nDuring the workshop, I shared insights into the fundraising journey, particularly for early-stage startups led by diverse founders. We covered strategies to “prepare for a raise”—focusing on clarity, creating urgency, and defining a compelling, market-focused value proposition. It’s crucial for founders to highlight not only their business strengths but also the unique value they bring as individuals. 🎯\n\nSome key takeaways we discussed:\n- Be prepared! Do the groundwork on mindset, market research, and process.\n- Show investors the path to profitability and the potential for an exit. You have to help them see the “big picture.”\n- Approach fundraising strategically, even raising when you don’t need the cash to bring in valuable partners who can accelerate your business.\n- Gather feedback with “soft pitches” before launching a full round to refine your pitch and pinpoint the right investor fit.\n- Balance feedback with confidence—take advice, but know when to push back.\n\nRemember, when you approach fundraising with clarity, conviction, and vision, you’re much more than just your startup’s founder. You’re the driver of a future unicorn. 🦄✨\n\nThank you, Cyberport Hong Kong, and all the fantastic attendees who brought their energy and curiosity! Excited to see the impact you’ll create.

Let us support and uplift one another, knowing that our collective strength knows no bounds. Let us embrace our uniqueness and diversity, recognizing that it is our differences that make us strong.\n\nBut the celebration of Women's History Month isn't just about looking back; it's about looking forward with hope and determination. It's about amplifying the voices of women from all walks of life and ensuring that every girl and woman knows their worth and potential.💪🚀\n\n🚀 Let us break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and build a future where every woman and girl can thrive.

This highlights a clear double standard in the way these platforms handle ads for women-focused sexual products.\n\nAccording to Polly Rodriguez, the founder of Unbound, the issue lies in society's discomfort with women, femmes, and nonbinary individuals taking ownership of their own bodies and pleasure. It's not the products themselves that are offensive, but rather the notion of empowering women and marginalized genders.\n\nRead article here: https://lnkd.in/eyVE-j73\n\n#genderlens #SexualEmpowerment #wellness #womenshealth #startup #womenfounders",

Employees’ former secret battles–with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and more–evolved into the foremost concern workplaces are looking to solve over the next five years.” says Ariela Safira, founder of Real. \n\nWith 76% of U.S. workers reporting at least one symptom of mental illness last year, organizations are feeling the impact on their bottom line. Real is committed to closing that gap with a scalable, affordable, confidential, and trustworthy approach. \n\nRead full article here: https://lnkd.in/gEPcMhmT\n\n#mentalhealth #GenZ #millennials #futureofwork #startup #wellness #womenentrepreneurs",

Reading previous stories they’ve written or listening to podcast episodes that are already posted can tell you a few important things:\n\n1). How do they stylistically handle interviews? Do they give their guests plenty of time to answer or do they frequently interrupt?\n\n2). Are their questions very targeted or are they more open-ended?   Ironically, the less-specific questions often can be more challenging to answer.\n\n3). Is their tone easy going and hospitable or more intense and aggressive?\n\n4). Is there a topic of conversation that captures their imagination to the point where they find a way to work it into every interview?  For instance, perhaps they’re fascinated by AI, and they seem to always incorporate a question on that subject. You can rest assured they’ll do the same with you.\n\nDoing a little advance research to create your own scouting report on your interviewer can help eliminate unwelcome surprises.",

We can handle that.\n\nHere’s the problem: \n\nI’ve seen so many businesses consistently publishing content... but not doing SEO. No keyword strategy informing their topic choice. No studying the search habits of their target audience to tailor their content to their burning questions. Just pumping out surface-level content that has no chance of being found. \n\nIt’s a HUGE missed opportunity.\n\nThe good news? SEO is actually simpler than ever. If you're already publishing blog posts, you're already halfway to \"doing SEO.\"\n\nThe algorithms have gotten smarter, which means SEO is now 90% content: helpful, original, in-depth content that aligns with what your audience is already searching for. In many cases, the technical backend wizardry is already automatically in place (and the rest is so easy, a cave man cou— wait, that phrase is probably trademarked).\n\nIf you’re tracking with me, check out my latest blog post where I break down the relationship between content marketing and SEO—and how to make them work together in 2025 for real results (link in first comment).\n\n#SEO #ContentMarketing #B2BMarketing",

Even though it would stay up on the website, once the initial distribution push was over, it brought in little ongoing traffic.\n\nAt first, I thought: Not my problem. I did my part. Distribution wasn’t in my job description.\n\nBut I couldn’t stop wondering: What if I could help clients turn their content into long-term traffic drivers—not just short-term PR wins?\n\nIn 2020, I started diving into SEO. I took a blogging course from Ahrefs and realized SEO was the missing piece. When you combine high-quality content with a strong SEO strategy, you can build thought leadership and attract a steady stream of qualified leads.\n\nI continued my SEO crash course with Grow & Convert’s Top Content Marketer Course and then worked with them for two years as a strategist, helping clients land dozens of top 3 rankings and convert hundreds of visitors into leads.\n\nBut I also saw a gap. Some companies didn’t need a full agency—they needed a fractional, in-house SEO strategist who could work closely with their team and help them build the internal systems to succeed.\n\nSo that’s what I do now. I’m stoked to introduce three new services (and reintroduce my original superpower): \n\n🔹 Fractional SEO Strategy – I plug into your existing marketing team and help you plan and execute an SEO strategy that drives results over time.\n🔹 SEO Audit + 12-Month Strategy – A one-time, done-for-you roadmap to improve your rankings and content performance.\n🔹 SEO Coaching – For founders and marketers who want to DIY, but need expert guidance.\n🔹 Content Writing – I’m still available as a writer whenever you need senior-level writing that reflects your brand voice and supports your search strategy.\n\nMy clients are already seeing results. For one client, a content-led SEO strategy drove 68% growth in organic traffic, tripled their top 3 keyword rankings, and boosted their Domain Rating from 18 to 30—in under a year.\n\nAnd now, I’m thrilled to share my new website: www.oliviabarrow.com, which reflects the strategic work I do at the intersection of SEO and content. (Huge thanks to Jessee Fish for the beautiful design.)\n\n👉 If you're a founder or marketing lead looking to grow your visibility without hiring an agency—or if you’ve been spinning your wheels trying to DIY your SEO—let’s talk.",

Here are the top three I use on a Mac: \n\n1. Reopen the Last Closed Tab on a Browser: Command + Shift + T (a lifesaver every time I accidentally hit the X instead of opening one of my 47+ open tabs) \n\n2. Open the Folder One Level Up in Finder: Command + Up Arrow (I gave that a clunky name, but if you've ever been in a folder in Finder and had no idea where that folder lived, you can use this keyboard shortcut to climb the ladder of nested folders until you get to one you recognize...now if only Google Drive would recognize this shortcut)  \n\n3. Paste Without Formatting: Command + Shift + V (whenever you want to copy and paste the words, but not the crazy fonts/colors/spacing they had in the original document, which will surely wreak havoc on your new document) \n\nGot any others that will change my life?",

I wrote an authoritative and in-depth article based on a subject matter expert interview that perfectly matched search intent, and I performed rigorous on-page SEO optimization with Clearscope. After it was published, I added internal links from relevant articles that were published in the following months. That’s it. \n\nSo do you need to change your strategy? \n\nIt depends on whether you were already hip to the importance of high quality content that offers original insights. If you were still churning out “SEO content” that provided thin coverage of topics without any real expertise or authoritative opinions, then yes, you will need to change your strategy. \n\nBut if your current SEO strategy focuses on in-depth content that provides the best answer on the internet for your target search queries, then you don’t need to change your strategy at all. AI Overviews favor well-researched and cited articles that concisely satisfy the search intent. Thankfully, most human readers do too.",

For a very long time I’ve been looking for an app that would help me track some minor health issues (upset stomach, headaches, stuff like that) along with all of the potential triggers (food, activity level, stress, etc.) to help me find correlations. \n\nI finally found one that looked promising and started using it a month ago (it’s called Bearable). \n\nSo far, the correlations are questionable at best, and sometimes very entertaining. According to the app, going to bed late and eating gluten both boost my mood by 26%, and time outside makes my overall symptoms 20% worse. 😂\n\nBut I’ve noticed an unexpected benefit. Now that I’m tracking how much water I drink in a day, and how many steps I take, I’ve been trying to improve both of those. It’s also got me thinking about adding in meditation, to give me another box to check off each day (the elementary school desire for a gold star has never left me). \n\nMaybe I should start measuring my efforts to network and connect with people in my industry… 🤔",

    "Olivia Barrow's post 1yr ago": "Exactly seven years ago today, I quit my last corporate job and started Olivia Barrow Communications. Here are 7 Things I've Learned in 7 Years. \n\n1. Start before you’re ready. You’ll never be fully ready, so just dive in. Everyone is always learning as they go. That’s the fun of it. \n\n2. New clients can come from anywhere. I’ve gotten connected to amazing, long-term clients from my running community, my coworking space (shoutout to 100state for connecting me to current clients Curate and vChief), my former employer, interview subjects, and complete strangers who found my LinkedIn, just to name a few. \n\n3. Referrals can take years. But when they come through, they can turn into amazing opportunities. \n\n4. Pricing never gets easier. I have to battle my inner demons daily to believe I’m worth what I charge. \n\n5. There will always be a new piece of technology to learn. And it will always make me uncomfortable, until suddenly it’s second nature.\n\n6. When self-care comes first, everything else falls into place. Everything else will sort itself out if I take care of myself, whether that’s maintaining my mental health by exercising, taking the time to prepare healthy lunches, or giving my body the rest it needs by taking an unplanned sick day. \n\n7. Whenever I give back, I get more. Every time I donate my time, talent, or treasure and extend myself just a little more than feels comfortable, the universe shows up with amazing gifts far beyond the risk I took. \n\nHere are two fun photos from that fateful summer. The first is a picture of a TV appearance I have only the vaguest memory of (I was a newspaper reporter, so being on TV was an occasional job hazard) showing my long hair and makeup days. It took me 4 years and a global pandemic to start working on that novel, but I'm 196 pages in now, thanks to Madison Writers' Studio. The second is the first check I cashed as a business owner, for $300 on Aug. 17. \n\nIt's been an amazing ride.",

They just care about whether you can solve their problems. Later on, when your success has bred copycat competitors, you might need that \"why\" to help distinguish yourself.\n\nAnd if you make it to that point, your customers might end up showing you a \"why\" that you would never have imagined. Airbnb just figured out their why 11 years in. In a recent blogpost, the founders noted: \n\n“What started as a way for a few friends to pay the rent has now transformed into something bigger and more meaningful than we ever imagined...People thought Airbnb was about renting houses. But really, we’re about home...What makes this global community so special is that for the very first time, you can belong anywhere. That is the idea at the core of our company: belonging.”\n\nYour \"why\" may or may not come to you easily. If it does, it might transform the way you think about your business. But if you have to spend 6 months or a year turning your brain upside down looking for it, it will leave you with less clarity than when you started.",

That obsession with defying \"normal\" evolved as they got to know their customers and their own abilities.\n\n\"Start with why\" is great advice for established corporations with a solid product, processes that make that product exceptional, and an established customer base. If you need to diversify your business, then defining your why can help guide you into new products or services that your customers will trust you to offer.\n\nBut if you have no customers, then why does it matter what anyone associates you with? Startups pivot all the time. Spending time figuring out a why that will be flexible enough to handle your early pivots is a waste of time when you should be focusing on finding a product-market fit, defining your target audience, and articulating your value proposition.",

My interns wrote the first draft, and then I revised the posts. Often, their first drafts were excellent, and when they needed improvement, I was able to quickly come up with a better option — much faster than if I was working on the original draft.\n\nWhen we were working on one-source stories, whether a personal profile of a member of our coworking space or a blog post for a long-term client, they were more than capable of creating the first draft. Sometimes I took over the draft from them, and other times I edited through comments and suggestions and let them continue to polish from there.\n\nBut where I struggled to delegate was with new clients. It was usually new work that I hadn't established a process for, and I wanted to have full control over the first impression. Part of the problem is that at this point in my career, I am still establishing processes and still working to define what my core services are. \n\nSo next time, I'll make sure those processes are locked down before hiring interns.",

Being an editor gave me the ability to say, “we can write this more clearly” or “this point isn’t fully developed, do you have a better example?” And since someone else was going to do the work, I was willing to be a more honest editor. \n\nIt’s tough to provide that kind of editing for your own writing because no one wants to make more work for themselves.

I wanted that rich exchange of ideas that makes every project stronger.\n\nBut just because they were sitting right next to me did not always mean we were collaborating.\n\nOur best ideas and solutions came from the rare occasions when I pushed back the mountain of “urgent” projects and pulled us into the conference room to check-in, brainstorm, and collaborate. Even when we weren’t totally sure what the problem was before we started, we still came away with valuable new perspectives.\n\nIt also gave me a lot more practice with my elevator pitch for every new project or idea for my business. Just by getting the interns up to speed, I found new clarity in my own ideas. \n\nEven though I experienced these benefits, I still let the excuse of being “too busy” keep me from sticking to a schedule of weekly collaboration meetings.\n\nNext time, I will look for ways to create accountability for myself so that I don't let such valuable habits slide. #accountability #lessons \n#clarity",

I hadn’t realized how often I had made decisions or backed away from projects because I didn't know how to do something that I could have easily just Googled. \n\nMy interns reminded me just how useful Google is, as long as you have an idea and a willingness to learn how to do something new.\n\nI delegated this research and learning out to my interns several times. They Googled, found a handful of how-tos, digested them, and presented their findings to me. Violet, who had never used Medium.com before, became an expert in optimizing the format and design of posts on Medium. Haley figured out how to set up Stripe on my www.GigniteIncubator.com website. They found many other incredibly helpful articles about content marketing best practices that I hadn't thought to search for and that saved me from reinventing the wheel. \n\nInstead of backing down from work that I don’t feel 100% confident in, I want to challenge myself to keep learning new skills. Most of the time, the answers are just a Google search away.\n\n#8InternLessons",

The fact that I had gone through the trouble of finding and hiring paid interns made other people assume I was more successful than I was. \n\nConfidence is everything when you're a freelancer. So having people look at me in awe definitely gave me extra swagger in pitching my business. It was fun to talk about what “my team” would do instead of just talking about me.\n\nWe have a very collaborative culture in Madison's freelance scene. We often share leads in our Facebook group, and whenever we find a path to success, we share it. \n\nBut I also noticed some freelancers looking at me like, \"If Olivia has interns, should I hire interns?\" My interns represented me well in the community, so I answered many questions about how to hire awesome interns. But I got fewer questions about how having interns was actually impacting my business. \n\nThe moral: Don't make a business decision because someone you admire made that same decision unless you know it's right for your business.",

    "Olivia Barrow's post 6yr ago": "My short series reflecting on what I learned from having interns continues: \n\nLesson 2: With interns, I missed my independent schedule.\n\nI let my interns set their hours based on their class schedule, and we ended up with one or both of them working 4 to 6 hours Monday- Friday. Since I typically spend most of the hours of 9-to-5 at my coworking space, I didn’t think this would be a problem. But as soon as I had a reason to stick to an actual schedule, I realized how frequently I flex my hours, or work from home, or take coffee meetings at odd times. \n\nHaving to show up at 9:30 a.m. every Monday — I know, not even that early — was a shock compared to the previous 18 months of complete schedule freedom.\n\nWhen the internship was over, I was relieved to be the master of my schedule again.\n\nAbout halfway through, we found a rhythm with longer projects, and I knew I could depend on the interns to work independently if I needed to take a meeting during their hours.  \n\nThe biggest lesson was realizing how much I value that schedule flexibility. I had turned down paid gigs because they looked like they would cramp my style, so why had I created an internship that would do the same?\n\nNext time, I'll design the position with remote work and schedule flexibility in mind.\n\n#8InternLessons",

If you’re thinking about hiring interns, follow this hashtag to make a more informed decision. #8InternLessons\n\nLesson 1: Managing people is hard.\n\nMy interns were both seniors interested in experiencing freelancing and improving their written communication skills. They were enthusiastic, undaunted by challenges, and brought new perspectives to my work.\n\nBut managing them was still so much harder than I had imagined. From the hamster wheel of assigning meaningful work to the emotional energy it took to coach and give feedback, it felt like its own full-time job. \n\nI gained a huge appreciation of the challenge my former bosses faced in managing me. 😳\n\nMy grand plans for the interns included meeting every Tuesday to review what we were learning, discuss the future of content marketing, and work together on professional development. \n\n...That happened about twice. The rest of the time I was “too busy” or too stressed out to effectively lead a meeting like that. \n\nNext time, I'll set more attainable goals for team meetings.",

Fun fact - Angelique helped me come up with the idea for my podcast, Sworn Testimonies. She also created my podcast intro music - which I’m obsessed with. If you can’t tell, we love each other a lot, which makes collaboration easy and effortless. We created a podcast course called PMS (podcasting made simple) to walk people through starting their own podcast! My podcast has not only given me a much needed outlet to express myself and tell stories that matter to me, but it also lead to my book publishing deal!

His innovation reduced the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nThe new system was much more efficient. Under the old system, even if EVERY worker was productive, building a car took 12 hours. Why did the new system drastically improve productivity? Because systems affect outcomes.\nAre there police officers who are good people, with good intentions? Of course! But this does not change the fact that the SYSTEM is broken. If racist, prejudiced cops are being given a license to kill, and black people are being murdered at astronomically disproportionate rates, the system is broken. If laws and sentencing are applied to benefit some racial groups and not others, the system is broken.\n\nHave you ever wondered why being caught for underage drinking or doing drugs at a white college party has little to no consequences, but there are black men who have been in prison for years for possession of marijuana (even though white America has now turned marijuana into a big business)? Once a crime is no longer associated with blackness, it is deemed more socially acceptable. \n\n#SystematicRacismExplained"

But there's still a lesson here for those watching their career industries slowly but irrevocably change around them. What lesson you take from it, however, is up to you.\n\nWriter Joel Stein said first, the free food changes, check. \n\nFor me, it was watching the lavish holiday offerings on the break room table diminish year after year when I worked in publishing. From huge Harry & David gift boxes filled with different varieties of apple — that's where I tried Pink Lady for the first time — to nothing. It was a wrench.\n\nThen the real estate changes. Yup. If you hear whispers of the building playing hardball when it comes time to renew the lease, you know why. For me, when you move from Michigan Avenue with floor to ceiling windows and a view of the lake down the block to the Illinois Center and a view of the street it's not terrible, but it is notable.\n\nChange happens quick. You have to remain vigilant, but I agree with Stein's assertion that we blame technology wrongly. #AI is not exactly the problem.

Sold. \n\nAnd while I don't know if I'd describe this slightly longer than a minute attempt to attract attention to the company's new iPad with such a strong adjective, it certainly did what it was supposed to do: \n\nBe memorable, provoke a reaction, and get me to talk about the product that I saw in the ad. \n\nSo, no. This brief time essentially watching history, art, hobbies, creativity and connection bundled into one idea and then pulverized into a slim, minimalist piece of appropriately branded technology, wasn't disgusting. \n\nBugs that see you and then run somewhere you can't find them are disgusting. \n\nThis was disturbing. And thought provoking.\n\nPart of me wonders if the company knew it would be disturbing — and memorable and shocking and newsworthy — and just let it ride in the creative corporate version of \"let the chips fall where they may.\" \n\nTheir equally minimalist apology — “We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.” — seems — to me — to suggest a certain laissez-faire disregard for the emotional havoc they may have left in some viewers.\n\nAs for the problematic message the video contained, that: We live in a world where technology can, ostensibly, replace all of these tangible, significant things in one thin tech tool. Yeah. Dodgy. Maybe even super dodgy considering we're living in a time when tech (AI) is eating industries and jobs like Pac-Man on steroids.\n\nBut let's be fair, it did work. If I hadn't bought a new iPad fairly recently, this messy little video might have prompted me to check this one out. \n\n#Content #ContentMarketing #Strategy #KellyeMedia #Branding",

Instead, Bennet's successor has expanded both the size and scope of NYT Opinion, operating it almost as a separate newsroom that publishes longform reporting and even breaks news.

Just because someone gets past a paywall doesn't mean they produce no value. It's still possible to serve them ads, and they're more likely to evangelize your content so it reaches more people. For instance, while I pay for a lot of news -- at least $2,000 a year -- I also regularly utilize tools to bypass paywalls and share links to that content within my newsletter. \n\nOf course, there are ways to prevent people from bypassing your paywall, but it also involves making it possible for sites like Google to properly index your content. It likely drives up conversion rates but makes it more difficult for a publisher to grow its audience.\n\nAnd let's say you are comfortable with 10% of your audience bypassing your paywall; what happens if the public becomes more educated on these methods and the number bumps up to 20% or even 30%. At some point the paywall leakage would grow so high that publishers would have no choice but tighten the restrictions.",

What's especially galling about this is that Fox was already trouncing both of these networks in linear TV viewership, so they had every incentive to build out online businesses.\n\nInstead, MSNBC was just never well incorporated into the Peacock app and CNN wasted the entire Chris Licht era trying to revive its TV ratings, which was just never going to happen.\n\nNow, MSNBC is getting spun off from Comcast, which will probably delay any major digital investments in the near future. To his credit, CNN CEO Mark Thompson is extremely serious about building out CNN's digital subscription business, but he's moving at a glacial pace.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox has a huge head start with its Fox Nation streaming service and recently purchased a podcast network that houses many of its former stars. It managed to see the writing on the wall even though it was winning on linear TV.",

At the time, a bunch of big celebrity podcast deals had fizzled -- Prince Harry and Megan being the most high profile example -- and some of the larger companies like Spotify had downsized their podcast staff.\n\nIn reality, the podcast industry was just going through a correction. A lot of dumb money had flowed toward unproven celebrity projects, and investors had overestimated how much people wanted to listen to expensive narrative shows. As it turned out, most consumers prefer cheap-to-produce chat podcasts and they really like watching video versions of these shows.",

It's basically created this amazing feedback loop where the top YouTube creators are able to invest more and more into the production of their content, thereby making it even more ambitious in its scope.\n\nThis is why YouTube will continue to dominate the Creator Economy in the future and also why it's now outcompeting traditional Hollywood on just about every metric. It's also why I just find it so inconceivable that nearly every other major social platform is refusing to share a significant portion of their revenue with creators.

Not necessarily. I've always considered access to top officials to be overrated. Some of the best investigative reporting on Meta, for instance, came not from interviews with Mark Zuckerberg, but rather insights gleaned from low-level employees who were willing to speak to reporters anonymously.\n\nThe same is true for the Trump administration; interviews with Trump and his circle of sycophants produce very little of value, and yet there's been so much great journalism published in the last few months that depended on sources within the federal bureaucracy, where much of the nuts and bolts of governing is done. \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eiAXgMXZ",

First he pulled the Kamala Harris endorsement. Then he donated to and attended Trump's inauguration. Then he pivoted the op-ed page in what many felt was a pro-conservative direction.

It's not that LinkedIn's users are necessarily clamoring for more video, either -- the algorithm and widgets will simply force video into users' feeds, whether they ask for it or not. \n\nI have no problem with any platform building out tools that make it easier to create and upload video, it's just clear to anyone who's opened the LinkedIn app recently that it's determined to push you into vertical video regardless of how well it performs against any other types of content.\n\nAnd is any of this video actually good? For the most part, no. It's just generic business and career advice that's trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Much of it is just stuff that's been cross-posted from TikTok or Instagram Reels. As an experiment, I just quickly scrolled through my own feed and came across videos on how to craft an email signup and how to be more productive while working remotely. None of it was focused no topics I actually follow.\n\nAnd of course, LinkedIn hasn't launched any meaningful revenue share with these video creators, hence why most of the stuff there is just recycled from other platforms.

I think I'm pretty decent at creating content and engagement, but I'm not only bad at the business stuff, but I also just don't have enough time to focus on it.\n\nWhat would this partnership look like? I'm definitely open to ideas. One scenario I've been thinking about is having someone who's mostly responsible for helping to create the content that goes behind the paywall so I can be freed up to work mostly on free content that helps expand the top of the funnel.\n\nI could also envision it being someone who helps me in selling sponsorships -- though I've definitely gotten a lot more bearish on ads over the last year.\n\nAnyway, I think to make this partnership work I would need to offer a pretty decent revenue share -- that way whoever this person is starts making money on Day 1 and then we work together to grow the revenue pie.\n\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email.

Eli Cahan, an award-winning investigative journalist and pediatrician, was a Future of the American Child fellow in May of 2023, and it was great hearing about his latest reporting projects. I also caught up with two members of the first Widening the Pipeline fellowship cohort, Brittany Johnson of WCVB Channel 5 and Mina Corpuz of Mississippi Today.\n\nAnd where would NPF be without the stellar journalists who agree to share knowledge during our journalism trainings? Two months after she spoke virtually to Widening fellows, it was great to meet Martina Guzman of the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights in person, after she'd told fellows about the Verdad app she developed to combat misinformation. Felecia Dixon Henderson, MOD, of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education advised inaugural Widening the Pipeline fellows about societal fault lines in March of 2022, and Katrice Hardy, the new CEO of The Marshall Project, joined us virtually in July of 2022 to talk about supporting mental health in newsrooms. \n\nMaking sure your network amplifies your professional net worth takes time and effort, but it's always a good investment.",

I'll post links to some of the powerful sessions as they become available, but let me take a minute to share insights that packed a real punch:\n\n*There's no point in being anything but direct. The sustainability of our industry is directly in peril.\n\n*The business model many of us grew with is broken beyond our repair. Things are beyond our control and we did it to ourselves.\n\n*Tell the truth, show the truth. Show the the evidence. Here is the work we did. You have the right to check it. See for yourselves.\n\n*AI is providing effective tools, but we don’t have the infrastructure to fight back against misinformation and propaganda. We must work for common cause.\n\n*In too many marginalized places, we are falling down on the job. News deserts are real, and the consequences are pernicious.\n\n*Current events have illustrated that we are just an election away from being the target rather than the beneficiary of free speech restrictions. We must focus on bedrock principles of free speech.\n\n*The fourth estate must acknowledge the shadows cast by America’s contradictions.  Black Americans and the Black Press have always lived in a parallel world. Many are tired of the excitement around symbolic representation instead of authentic inclusion.\n\n*Misinformation is flourishing in communities because the powers that be want them to be misinformed. The way you get a society to vote against their own best interests is through misinformation.\n\nThe incredible scope and depth of the insights shared by speakers including Susan Goldberg, Martin Baron, Jelani Cobb, Ph.D., Evan Thomas, Amber Payne, Dale Anglin, Eddie Glaude, Maria Ressa, Jim Brady and Dame Louise Richardson have strengthened my commitment to the National Press Foundation's mission of making good journalists better.

During her early tenure, Dr. Hayden viewed a file containing Frederick Douglass's writings about the assassination of President Lincoln. As a girl growing up in Illinois, she had been obsessed with all things Lincoln, and of course she had studied the life of Frederick Douglass. She also mesmerized the audience by contextualizing the Library's historic role in fueling access to information. For example, African American poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar volunteered to read his poetry to the blind there.\n\nMinow and Hayden brilliantly outlined the importance of historical records, the potential for setbacks when knowledge is restricted, and what the future of access to reliable information might look like in a world riddled with unprecedented information manipulation and suppression.",

For example, women of childbearing age are often excluded from clinical trials, leaving them without access to some life-saving treatments and with limited or unsafe options. Involving women scientists in the development and adoption of trials is critically important.\n\nI had the great privilege of meeting Damaris in February of 2020, during a Nairobi media training for fellows in a global health leadership program with The Aspen Institute. Her passion and commitment to leveraging malaria research to benefit communities was evident then, and I'm confident her leadership along with Dr. Wasunna's will benefit the African continent greatly.\n\n#Africa #AfricanScientists #AfricanResearch #WomenInSTEM #STEM",

First up we discuss Comcast raising the idea of spinning off its cable TV networks to shareholders. A move like this has been speculated on for years, as the networks are buffeted by cord-cutting. Comcast also said Peacock gained 3 million subscribers in Q3, benefiting from the Paris Olympics. \n\nMeanwhile Alphabet said that YouTube’s revenue for the past 12 months hit $50 billion, a first for the company. As we discuss, it’s likely that subscription services, which include YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, Primetime Channels and Sunday Ticket, exceeded $15 billion. That would make YouTube one of the top 3 streaming subscription providers by size. \n\nListen to the podcast to learn more (21 minutes, 24 seconds)\n\n#InsideTheStream #Streaming #ConnectedTV YouTube Comcast #Peacock",

When engaging with a CTV ad, Aluma Insights new research found a whopping 70% of viewers do so via their MOBILE devices, vs. just 42% who use their CTV’s remote control. And when viewers were asked, Aluma found that 42% of respondents prefer to use their mobile device to engage with a shoppable TV ad, while 26% prefer using the CTV’s remote, and 24% have no preference.\n\nWhat does all this mean to marketers and content providers? That it’s essential to “swim downstream, not upstream” - advertisers should capitalize on viewers’ habits and preferences, integrating mobile engagement with elements like QR codes displayed in shoppable TV ads, rather than trying to force engagement behaviors that are not yet natural for many viewers. \n\nFor more, watch the 1 minute highlight video below and contact Douglas Montgomery or Michael Greeson about the full report including 37 high-value charts! https://bit.ly/alumavideo4\n\n(Want to know more about how VideoNuze created this video and something like it could help your company?

Per Aluma Insights new research, an average of 80% of 18-44 year-olds have engaged with shoppable ads in social video, but only an average of 32% of 45-year olds and older have have done so. Meanwhile, an average of 47% of 18-44 year-olds have engaged with shoppable ads in TV, but only an average of just 26% of 45-year olds and up have engaged with a shoppable ad in TV.\n\nWhat’s this mean?

Deep-pocketed Big Tech (Amazon, Google, Apple) are scooping up marquee sports rights in an effort to add value to their services businesses. Linear TV viewing is collapsing. Consumers' attention is fragmenting as myriad social media and other activities beckon for eyeballs. \n\nOn this week’s Inside the Stream podcast, Colin Dixon and I discuss how #ESPN  has found itself at the center of this storm, as the venerable network gets squeezed from all sides. We raise a pressing - yet until recently unimaginable - question newly reinstated #Disney CEO Bob Iger must address: long-term, is ESPN still a good business? And if it’s not, should Disney keep the network anyway, or seek to sell it off?\n\nCheck out the podcast here: https://lnkd.in/e3Fd8tri\n\nnScreenMedia #sports #CTV #streaming #podcast #cordcutting",

    "Will Richmond's post 2yr ago": "Revisiting Netflix’s Reed Hastings Video Interview With Me On May 10, 2010\n \nWith Netflix’s Reed Hastings transitioning to Executive Chairman, I decided to re-watch the 18-minute video interview I did with him on May 10, 2010 in Netflix’s offices in Los Gatos, CA (see links below). The interview was facilitated by Steve Swasey, the company’s late, great head of comms at the time.\n \nBefore starting the interview I distinctly remember being somewhat discombobulated from setting up the tripod, lighting and camcorder (remember those?). So after asking my first question and as Reed began answering, it hit me that I’d forgotten to push the camcorder’s “record” button. So we began again.\n \nAs longtime VideoNuze readers know, I haven’t always agreed with everything Reed and the Netflix team have done in the past 13 years. But IMHO there is no single person who deserves more credit than Reed for catalyzing the massive business model and technical innovations that have reshaped Hollywood, the broader TV industry and consumers’ experiences.\n \nWatch Part 1:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eXAbUmxQ\n \nWatch Part 2:\nhttps://lnkd.in/e37dGzwR\n \n(if the editing looks primitive to you, it’s because I did it myself)\n \nThe day of the interview Netflix’s valuation was approximately $6 billion. Now it is approximately $150 billion.\n \nRemember that this interview was recorded before:\n- “House of Cards” and tens of billions of dollars invested in original content\n- Launch of Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video Channels, TikTok, etc, etc.\n- 4K streaming \n- “Peak TV”\n- International SVOD expansion\n- Connected TV explosion\n- “FAST” channels\n- Qwikster\n- Etc.\n \nIt was also years before Netflix would provide all of us with its recording of “Springsteen on Broadway,” The Boss’s 2018 solo show at the Walter Kerr Theater in NYC that is 2 ½ hours of truth-telling, soul-revealing, mind-boggling, age-defying, awe-inspiring, ass-kicking poetry in motion, which I can never get enough of (shout out to Ted Sarandos, who no doubt greenlighted it).\n \nLast, the interview occurred 3 months after I wrote “It’s Official: Netflix Has Entered a Virtuous Cycle” in February, 2010  which I finished with:\n “For years I have been saying that broadband video is the single most disruptive influence on the traditional video distribution value chain. Netflix's success with streaming and the consequences that are yet to play out are resounding evidence of this. Above and beyond YouTube, Hulu, Amazon, Apple and others, Netflix is by far the most important video distributor to watch.”\n\n😁 \n\nRead it here if you'd like: \nhttps://lnkd.in/eg9aUupK \n\n#streaming #SVOD\n\nBelow is a 40 second clip from the interview of Reed discussing competitors he was most scared of at the time:",

While exploring Black agriculture in West Virginia, I met a third-generation forager named Ruby Daniels Holland of Creasy Jane's. Her small business focuses on herbs she forages and grows for soaps, teas, salves and more.\n\nForager Ruby explained how Blacks in the Appalachia region relied on foraging to harvest herbs, nuts and fruits to subsist during the harshest periods in American history.\n\nIn conversation, I told her about the mullein leaves I saw growing along a river in McDowell County. She explained that mullein is the herb that is good for respiratory illnesses.\n\n\"Nature will grow for you what you need,\" she told me before explaining how black lung was a common illness for coal miners. The abundance of mullein was the earth providing medicine for the thousands who fought the disease, and in many ways acts as an aromatherapy.\n\nI was blown away by this drop of knowledge that she said so nonchalantly, but with depth.\n\nOne of the areas Ruby talked about is Afrolachian identity, which for her is rooted in Blacks folks who have been intertwined with Native and whites in the area. From that, a culture was birthed.\n\nAt Black Farmers Index, we are excited that she will be leading a workshop in our 2-Day Black agriculture tour on urban foraging.

It was my full entry into the labor it takes to grow organically and sustainably. \n\nDr. Amen Nazirakh uses SRI, a form of rice harvesting that uses minimal amounts of water to reduce the methane gas found in rice fields across the world.

What they would find were gardens that subsisted us.\n\nMy Uncle Don had the illest garden---tomatoes, leafy greens, strawberries, squash, etc. Then he had an orange and lemon tree. All you had to do was go to the back yard with one of those 11 million plastic bags under your mother's kitchen counter that she saved, and get your fill.\n\nUncle Don was my mother's cherished brother. They grew up in Lafayette, Louisiana, but had family throughout the Acadiana region---from St. Martinville to Broussard. The food was partially ethnic produce from home, and it was also preserving the growing legacy that many Black migrants left when they departed the South. Albeit, much of it was forced.\n\nThat being said, it feels good to work with a L.A. County Farmer, Mr. Charlie Southward of IGH Gardens in Long Beach. Farmer Charlie grew up in Riverside, just east of the city, but his family is from Texas. \n\nAt IGH, we help him grow batches of food to feed seniors and women and children in transitional housing. On this day, we picked some collards for a program that Mr. Southward was donating to. \n\n#urbanagriculture hashtag\n#blackfarmersindex hashtag\n#urbanfarmers"

In fact, he met a couple of distant cousins in a town where his grandfather grew up on a farm. There were even quite of few people that he resembled that I was floored how genetics can retain and disperse. It was really kind of cool to sit back and watch him return to his roots. Many Black folks who family's moved out of the rural South are not afforded those opportunities and eventually lose all contact.\n\nOnce our connections were established, many doors opened and conversations flowed.

But the short story is Dr. Releford is a podiatrist who focused on diabetes. His specialty was to prevent amputation. When he saw the diets of his most chronic patients, he began to advise them to eat better. But how can you when most live in areas where healthy food is overwhelmed by fast food. So he started initiatives and wrote a book.\n\nBut food access was still key, so about 2 years ago, he bought a ranch. To own property in L.A. County is a hump, but to own that much is beyond impressive. Plus Dr. Releford turned this ranch around in 1 year. It has tunnel houses, orchards, chickens, vineyard and other elements that make it a farm, event space, retreat site and local favorite happy hour when the sun sets and the heat cools off.\n\nBut the foodie and herb-lover in me cannot get over the nuts, lavender and lavender-sugar I purchased there. A walnut farmer told me that once you taste a fresh walnut, you will not look back. Those almonds and walnuts from Bloom Ranch melted in my mouth. I should've bought more bags, and hoping to see them in their online store\n\nLike I advise most folk who want to buy from a Black farmer, start with 1 commodity or regular provision in your home that you can purchase from them.

The story centered the horrid experiences of Black Colorado ranchers, Nicole and Courtney Mallery.\n\nIn January 2023, I launched a series titled \"Get Out\" in Ark Republic. It detailed the Mallery's ongoing traumatic engagement in a predominantly white town in Colorado. Indeed, it was something like a horror movie. They told us that no one believed their story, which made it a whole season of the Twilight Zone.  \n\nBut I believed them as I have been working with Black farmers for 4 years now and some of the stories are heartbreaking. What I didn't expect was the response from the public when the first story came out and I partnered with Black Farmers Index for a campaign drawing attention to the Mallery's dire situation.\n\nThe public placed pressure on law enforcement, local officials and even the other media to report on the issue. Their immediate dangers subsided somewhat, but they are still fighting the good fight. What is incredible to know is that Peele and members of his production crew saw it important to tell the story too.\n\nSome months ago, I learned that the wheels of pre-production started churning with the Mallery's in it. A few weeks ago, received word that Peele was given the greenlight to do a series. It will stream on Peacock.\n\nSo this is a thank you to those who supported this small independent Black-owned press called Ark Republic. This is testament of how critical small press members are in the ecosystem. Support your local press, and support Black-owned media and media professionals.\n\nThe Mallery's are having a Juneteenth celebration at their Freedom Acres Ranch this weekend. Wishing them the best.

Transformative.\n\nBlack Farmers Index was invited to McDowell County, West Virginia to see how Jason Tartt and his family of T&T Organics Farm are working to bring back a once thriving Black community. What he's done since 2009 is pick up the pieces of a community almost broken by the implosion of the energy economy and give it life, acre by acre. But his answer was simple: Agriculture. \n\nWhile there, we tasted Appalachian honey from Heritage Mountain Farms from Nicole Edwards then ate freshly picked eggs from mountain range chickens raised by Mr. Donnie Hairston, as we learned how all the farmers and beekeepers employ organic growing methods is part of T&T Organics' efforts to remediate a town that was polluted by coal mining. The educational 350-acre farm also trains a multi-racial local workforce so that they can re-enter the labor market with skills.\n\nThe next day we went to Charleston, the state's capital to explore urban farming with Know Yourself Corporation who has several farms throughout the city that work to provide fresh cheap and free produce; and are building a grocery store. Then we met Ms. Ruby who grows mountain medicinals. To say I am full is an understatement."

There are a mix of opinions, emotions and actions. \n\nOne thing for sure, the young folk of today on a growing number of campuses are calling for substantial changes in the world, from both a domestic and global lens. So, how can we support this from a healthy vantage point?\n\nThis is a photo I took on my way to a lecture.

From watching her favorite hen, Charger, strut around the estate, to listening to the sweetest story of how she located the seeds to the mustard greens that her grandmother ate in Mound Bayou, Mississippi before and after she migrated to Detroit, was absolutely exquisite. \n\nJust think to have found and now grow the same strain of a food that your great great grandparents ate? Lineage runs through blood, soil and seed. But what a great farmer to support for this coming Easter or Eid.\n\nMany people still say that they cannot find a Black farmer selling, so my commitment since 2020 is to point the world into the right direction.

Recently, we reported the story of Courtney and Nicole Mallery, a Black rancher couple in Colorado who were struggling to be heard by local officials when they experienced racial terror in a rural town. \n\nThanks to our approach to activism-journalism, we were able to make a difference. We partnered with Black Farmers Index and activated growers across the US, raising over $235,000 for legal fees and repairs to their 1,000-acre ranch. The Mallerys also received $10,000 from the NAACP to retain a lawyer. \n\nUnfortunately, our work came at a cost. We received hate emails, messages, my website was hacked, and I got disturbing phone calls and online trolls. But, we'd do it all over again. Thankfully, some cool folk believe in our work too. \n\nToday, we’re kicking off our year-end fundraising campaign, and we’re excited to share that this year we have an amazing opportunity from the Knight Foundation and Lenfest Institute for Journalism's transformation fund who agreed to match the contributions we receive, dollar for dollar, up to $10,000.

The math shows that the class of 400, if divided, would have each walked out of a liberal arts college owing $100,000 in student loan #debt.\n\nThough the act of Smith has been noted as a generous and bold philanthropic action, the numbers show the predicted next bubble.

Did it feel like a real conversation, or were they busy typing notes on their computer as you talked? \n\nGrowing up by my parents’ hospital in India, I saw what medicine is supposed to be: deeply personal, built on trust, and grounded in human connection. My parents didn’t just diagnose illnesses—they knew their patients, their families, their struggles.\n\nOver the past two years, my wife and I spent considerable time in San Francisco hospitals as we welcomed our baby and navigated various health challenges. We met doctors and nurses who, despite working under immense pressure with packed schedules, showed genuine care. Yet we witnessed how the burden of documentation and administrative work pulled them away from patients, adding strain to an already demanding profession.\n\nThis experience reinforced what I've known all along - nothing is more important than good health and healthcare is not a profession, but a calling. As I reflected at the close of 2024, I knew my next chapter needed to be at the intersection of healthcare and AI. I'm really excited to be joining Ambience Healthcare on their product team, and grateful to Ahmed and Nikhil for the opportunity to be part of this journey.\n\nAmbience is using AI to give healthcare providers what they need most - reduced time on admin tasks, more time with patients and more time for their own families. This technology is already making a real impact at world’s leading hospitals like Cleveland Clinic and UCSF.\n\nThis also marks the end of my fulfilling 4-year journey at EarnIn. I’m deeply grateful to the EarnIn team, especially Ram, Yair, Karolina and Chood for their mentorship and support - building something truly meaningful for millions of everyday Americans.\n\nNext time you’re at UCSF or Cleveland Clinic, and your doctor is fully present—listening, not typing, ask if they’re using Ambience. I’d love to hear what they share with you.\n\n#Nextplay",

Medical societies in several countries have already issued guidelines to doctors on how to spot and treat this rare reaction. \n\nThere is a steep rise in vaccine skepticism given the *tiny* (~4 in a million) risk of clots. Today’s news on FDA pausing J&J shots will only add fuel to the fire. Good news is that doctors know how to recognize and treat this rare condition. \n\nGreat explanation from the Economist on this topic.\n\n“This combination of blood clots and low platelet counts is something that doctors know how to diagnose and treat, says Jean Marie Connors, a haematologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston. It resembles a condition seen in some people who are given heparin, a drug used widely to treat blood clots. For unknown reasons, some people develop an immune reaction to heparin, which results in blood clotting so profound that it depletes their platelets. The same reaction appears to be provoked by the vaccine.”",

Contrary to popular opinion, US seems to be doing quite well - with most vaccinations total (9.3M followed by China at 9M), and 5th highest per capita (after Israel, UAE, Bahrain and UK). Of course a lot more should and can be done.\n\n2. California is doing miserably and needs to get its act together. Only 27% of doses available have been administered, and one of the lowest per capita in the US (ranking 12th from the bottom). Especially alarming given the acute need, with uncontrolled disease spread and 1.5 months of shelter in place. In contrast, Texas is leading both in terms of total doses and one of the highest per capita immunizations. \n\n3. After initial hiccups, a sharp uptick in vaccines administered per capita (in the US) in the last week. Hopefully with the new admin coming in, and a change in policy of releasing the entire available supply (instead of saving it for a 2nd dose) will further increase number of people getting the vaccine. Noteworthy, on an aggregated basis the US has only used 36% of available doses so far - so vaccination is not yet supply constrained.",

But when I walked into the arena, I didn’t feel out of place at all.\n\nThere were:\n\n🏒 Couples of all ages and genders, cheering on their teams\n\n🏒 Local kids’ teams, watching history being made\n\n🏒 Little girls with their dads, seeing a future for themselves in the sport\n\nI remember going to Lakers games with my dad growing up. But back then, the only thing I could see myself becoming was one of the cheerleaders, the Laker Girls.\n\n80% of Fortune 500 female CEOs played a sport growing up. Eighty percent.\n\nSports teach teamwork, risk-taking, and humility, all skills that make people better leaders in business. And now, there’s another, badass, tier of sport for young girls to see themselves in. \n\nHaving these leagues helps women strive more to be in sports in the first place. \n\nIf I could invest in women’s sports like a stock, I’d be all in.",

I wanted this campaign to be different.\n\nWe ended up doing a survey with hundreds of female founders on how their fundraising convos were changing given the COVID-19 pandemic that had just started. We also asked them where they felt like they needed the most help and what they felt was now the likelihood that they would reach their goal.\n\nThis gave us a few insights:\n\n1️⃣ Problem: Female founders were struggling primarily with investor networks. Many of them first-time founders, they felt that they didn’t have the same level of networks as many of their male founder friends.\n\n❇️ SOLUTION: Get together a bunch of co-investors who actively invest in that stage and create spaces for female founders to build those networks.\n\n2️⃣ Problem: More than half of them felt like they weren’t going to reach their initial fundraising goal and would have to cut costs.\n\n❇️ SOLUTION: Build a partner network that gave exclusive discounts on software and services to female founders to help them cut costs.\n\nWhat started as a “marketing” campaign around understanding how founders were handling COVID-19 shutdowns quickly lent itself well to creating new partner networks, high-value events, and allowed for the impact to go beyond just another VC blog post. In my opinion, that's what good integrated marketing should look like.",

More time spent on these applications when founders could be building. \n\nAfter chatting with 100s of founders in Mercury Raise on accelerators, these are the biggest misconceptions:\n❌ The “big name” accelerator isn’t always the best one for you.\n❌ A warm intro won’t save a weak application.\n❌ Not all programs actually deliver value.\n\nSo I built the go-to guide for 2025, the no-fluff, founder-first playbook to choosing (and getting into) the right accelerator.\n💰 Need funding? Find programs with a real track record of alumni raises—not just “investor access.”\n🎯 Want customers? Some accelerators drive GTM—others just give advice.\n🛠 Need tactical support? Pick one with real operators, not just talking heads.\n\nI chatted with Techstars, 500 Global, and more last year through Mercury Raise to build the go-to-guide of what accelerators provide and what they're now looking for.

Connecting with climate-focused innovators, founders, and changemakers reinvigorated my belief that collaboration is the key to solving the climate crisis.\n\nAs part of the fellowship, I had the privilege of contributing to a capstone project with an incredible team: The Climatebase Startup Support Hub. Together, we built a resource designed to help early-stage climate startups access the mentorship, tools, and funding they need to thrive.\n\nHere’s what the team accomplished in just a few weeks:\n\n⭐️ Secured $500K+ in startup credits from platforms like Google, Solidworks, and Miro\n⭐️ Built connections to professional services in legal, branding, marketing, and more\n⭐️ Curated a list of events to help founders grow faster\n\nBut beyond the deliverables, this project was a reminder of the power of community. I played what was a small role alongside my teammates: Zachary D. (our fearless leader), Sara Lasseter, Ksenia Kurileva, Donald Mak, and Amalia Stern.\n\nThis is just the beginning. Supporting climate founders in their early stages is critical to scaling solutions to the world’s biggest problems, and I’m excited to see where this work leads next. 🚀",

We uncovered what helps founders stand out in their applications and how to navigate finding the right program for them. \n\nTLDR: 🚀 Accelerators aren’t for everyone—but they’re game-changers for the right companies.\n\n📋 Top Tips for Your Application:\n- Quantify your progress: Include clear traction metrics (e.g., “20% month-over-month growth” or “500 beta users with 60% retention”).\n- Show your founder-market fit: Share your unique expertise or lived experience that positions you to solve the problem better than anyone else.\n- Keep it real: “Your story matters more than your slides. Investors don’t back ideas—they back the people behind them.\n\n💡 What Accelerators Are Helpful For:\n- Early-stage startups looking for clarity in their go-to-market strategy or fundraising approach.\n- Building a network: “80% of founders who join Techstars find their first major customer or partner through the program,” as noted in the webinar.\n- Founders who thrive on feedback and iterative improvement in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.\n\n🛠️ Tactical Strategies for Founders:\n- Research past cohorts and mentors: Tailor your application by citing specific Techstars alumni or experts you admire.\n- Prepare a 30-second pitch: Clearly state the problem, your solution, traction so far, and why now is the right time.\n- Leverage early feedback: Test your pitch deck with customers or peers to refine clarity and impact.\n\nA huge thank you to our incredible panelists Sylvia Bouloutas, Vance D., Ahmed A. Mirza, Steve Bernard for sharing actionable advice. \n\nIf you’re a founder who missed this one, we’ve got more coming. Keep an eye out for future Mercury Raise events (link below).",

You should be telling your authentic story and background & be focused on connecting with the right audiences.\n\nSome other hot takes of mine as someone who’s been in the personal brand consultant role:\n\n- I would never write the social for badly written articles. That’s not good personal branding, and if someone has the time to write 1000+ word articles and not a LI post, I question if they actually understand personal branding.\n\n- I would never make someone an influencer for the sake of “going viral”. In the past, I rejected every client whose goal is only to become an LI influencer.",

Mercury has been a company that I've respected for quite some time. \n\nThere are so many companies that claim to support founders, but never truly provide the value they promise and/or fall short of solving the problems that are most relevant to founders. \n\nI've known Mercury for the past ~3 years in partnership roles and through some of their customers, and I've been able to witness first-hand their commitment to creating products and community of high quality. \n\nIn this role, I'll be helping to further that commitment by supporting the operations of Mercury Raise. Additionally, I'll be brainstorming ideas and concepts to add to their founder platform and community.\n\nLastly, I'm excited to be working with mallory contois, whom I've been a huge fan of ever since learning about her through the old girls club.

(stunning revelation I know) As soon as I suggest posting more, people start to show signs of fear.\n\n⚡️ Experimentation is more important than depth in the beginning. \n\nEverything is about learning.\n\nPeople are scared of being misunderstood so they resort to “well I should write a whole blog post on this”.\n\n⚡️ There are more types of content than a blog posts.\n\nPeople assume that their thoughts are worth reading when social media is literally a stream of everyone’s thoughts.\n\n⚡️ Why should they read on? Why waste their time? A name brand and big title will only get you so far. \n\nTLDR: The ROI needs to be front and center of anything you produce. And while personal brands feel person, don’t take it personally if a piece of content doesn’t perform the way you think it’s going to.\n\nThrowback to the event at LinkedIn I got to partner with Meagan Loyst on back in January. \n\n#personalbranding #socialmedia #brand",

The scene was full of... eccentric people.\n\nOn the side, I helped run an incubator at USC and my founder friends and I would often talk about mental health.\n\n❗ To my surprise, many of my founder friends struggled with anxiety and depression.\n\nMy friends and I were hosting events, and we decided to host one on mental health and startups. (shout out Angela H. Chen, Jeremy Becker, Michelle Kwok, Sam Park, & many others) \n\nDuring the promotion of the event, I got flooded with messages from other founders and operators, saying how this discourse on the subject was so needed. \n\nI started thinking about other ways I could help founders.\n\n➡ I found a job on LinkedIn and a few months later, found myself in marketing at 500 Global. \n\nThrough 500 Global, I felt like I got a masterclass for early-stage startups & wanted to move to the operator side.\n\nI loved helping 500 with their roll out of ESG & wanted to work in tech, but only for a company that I felt mission aligned with. Thank you to Tracy Barba who was the first to teach me so much about this space.\n\nScrolling through 2000+ startups in our portfolio, I happened to find one that was from a serial founder & long term focused.\n\nWhat happened next?\n➡ I didn’t get a referral.\n➡ I didn’t have some “in”.\n➡ I literally applied on LinkedIn.\n\nSo, lesson here is still apply. Even if it's just another job on LinkedIn. Even when you've gone through a million and one pivots. Apply. \n\nAnd yes, I still work there. 🙂 \n\n#marketing #startups #tech",

One of the things that I’ve been trying to emphasize more to them when it comes to philanthropy is that all you really learn when you raise money for a cause is how to ask people for money.  While I think those causes are good,in terms of practical life experience, It doesn’t provide much other than a line on your résumé. I am encouraging our college students to get out and really participate in do-it-yourself activism. If the environment is an issue, then pick up some trash, if poverty is an issue, then tutor at risk children or help build a house, if mental health and depression is an issue, then get out into nursing homes and speak with elderly who have some of the highest rates of depression.

Triaged 97 in 24 hrs. \nI’m sooo over this season.”\n\nCAH means critical access hospital which means this is a very small community hospital somewhere. The hospital ER only has 12 beds. And the the inpatient capacity is only 25 patients. A typical busy day in an ER of This size is maybe 40 to 50 patients.\n\nThey saw 97.\n\nAnd my guess is they only had one doctor. I also have no doubt that some of these people were critically ill with complications of pneumonia or influenza and needed to be transferred to higher levels of care.  \n\nThis is non-sustainable and why so many people are leaving our specialty.\n\nPatients don’t understand at times why they have to wait and what the delay is. This is the reason. Much of it stems from a lack of access to primary care in addition to the huge number of uninsured or uninsured patients.\n\nIf you go to an ER like this, please be kind to the ER  staff.

As a kid, I didn’t understand the adult routines that shaped our world. \n\nOn family vacations, he always carried a small cooler bag. Later, I learned it held his insulin.\n\nThe Butter section of our fridge was filled with small vials of medication. \n\nWe always ate dinner at exactly 5 p.m.—a rule that, as a kid who just wanted to stay out playing until dark, I found frustrating. \n\nI remember the small test strips scattered in his car, and the emergency candy tucked away in case his blood sugar dropped. \n\nEvery restaurant trip came with a discreet bathroom visit before the meal arrived. Looking back, I realize how much he quietly managed, never burdening us with the grueling nature of his condition.\n\nHe didn’t tell me he had diabetes himself. I actually found out through my cousin. Later, Dad explained that in the 1960s, just out of college and looking for engineering jobs, he had to hide his diagnosis because of the real threat of discrimination. That always stayed with me.\n\nInsulin gave my dad more time. It helped him live, work, raise a family—and protect us from the burden he carried. \n\nThis week is a powerful reminder that insulin isn’t just medicine. It’s a lifeline. But it only works when used safely.\n\nFor those interested in best practices and the evolving role of insulin in modern care, I highly recommend this excellent article:\n\n 🔗 https://lnkd.in/ei8Kc5S4\n\n#InsulinSafetyWeek #Type1Diabetes #DiabetesAwareness #InsulinSafety #Healthcare #ChronicCare #DigitalHealth",

We navigated the pain of dial-up internet at our parents' house, waiting for a single page to load while someone yelled at us to get off the phone. We’ve been on social media since Friendster and MySpace (some of you might have to ChatGPT those). We adapted to each new wave—embracing change rather than fearing it.\n\nBut let’s be real: as much as we love Spotify (I listen every day), nothing quite compares to the feeling of getting off work at a high school job in the mid-90s and heading to Best Buy to spend your paycheck on new CDs. The rush of tearing off the plastic, flipping through the liner notes, and popping in Pearl Jam, Counting Crows, DMB, or whatever else was about to blow your mind on the ride home—that was an experience.\n\nWe didn’t just watch technology evolve—we grew with it. We are digital immigrants who embraced every new frontier, and that ability to adapt, learn, and integrate change is what keeps us ahead today.\nWhat are your favorite memories from straddling the analog and digital worlds? Let’s hear them.\n\n#TechEvolution #Adaptation #DigitalTransformation #90sKids #FromWordProcessorToAI",

On occasions throughout the year, I like to bring out photos of my Grandfather Jack Clifford, and some family relics from his time serving in the Army during WWII. These artifacts serve as powerful reminders never to forget history and the insidious hatred that lurks beneath the surface of society. It's crucial to expose and combat this hate, ensuring that the sacrifices of our ancestors were not in vain.\n\nWhen I entered this world, I had the privilege of briefly knowing a resilient man, as tough as they come. Despite his toughness, his love for us was evident. I recall how he would playfully toast morning bagels on the gas range, sometimes allowing his hand, which had lost feeling, to catch fire just to elicit a reaction from us grandkids.\n\nI once accompanied him to a hardware store on Long Island where he boldly smoked inside. When asked to extinguish his cigarette, he winked at me before casually snuffing it out in the palm of his hand. As a child, I was curious about his wartime experiences, but he would always deflect, stating his reluctance to revisit those memories.\n\nTo all the veterans, thank you for your unwavering service to our country.",

I don't have a green thumb and I am horrible at keeping plants alive, and yet somehow it lives on. It survived a move, two energetic toddlers, a cat, and a new dog. Like myself, it has good days and weeks and bad ones. Sometimes I go weeks without caring for it and in other seasons it thrives just on its own. For me, it’s a great reminder that grief doesn’t shrink it grows.\n\nGrief grows from absolute horrendous unspoken pain to something we learn to tolerate as part of life. When we are young we think we are immune to this pain, this horror, this agony but it inevitably will land at each of our doorsteps many times in the best life. The longer we live the greater the odds become that we will suffer repeated loss. The harder we love the harder it becomes to say goodbye.\n\nGrief never goes away but it can become a companion to love. Forever part of something bigger and not just an endless hole. Acceptance allows space for old memories of laughs shared and wonderful times. We discover new ways to honor and include that person in the here and now. Some of us decide to switch careers and find more meaning in our work. Whatever way that one decides to handle your own grief, please know that it will change and you will change with it.",

From 2007 to 2016 I worked in this specialty of healthcare. \n\nMy late father was a type 1 diabetic. Once that I learned the dangers of non-healing wounds, I was immediately drawn to the amazing people who dedicate their lives to patient care. Ironically, just last week I received the news that a long-time friend of my dad's passed away as a result of an infection after a foot amputation. \n\nThis should not be happening in 2023! \n\nMore on my new role and my amazing employer soon. But in the meantime, if you work for a great wound care product company, I would love to connect or reconnect with you. \n#healthcare #woundcare #woundhealing #diabetes #woundcareproducts",

While the rest of us in corporate America enjoyed working from the comfort of our homes over the past two years, she was on the front lines helping the school navigate a global pandemic and remote learning, resulting in strong increases in student registrations and applications. She did all of this while raising our two beautiful babies. \n\nVery soon she is joining an amazing nonprofit, which provides K-12 teachers with what to teach and how to teach it—online, for free, to be shared broadly.

𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥.\n\nThat’s just one of the many takeaways from “Build AI-Powered Products”—a must-read new book by Marily Nika, Ph.D, a trailblazer in AI and one of the most inspiring women in tech I know.\n\nWe had the honor of supporting this book launch through my company, Raya Advisory, because we believe this knowledge needs to be in the hands of every product leader, founder, and technologist shaping the future.\n\nHundreds of people joined us at Intuit headquarters yesterday to hear Marily’s insights. \n\nMarily breaks down complex AI concepts and product strategy into actionable frameworks. A few key lessons from her book that stuck with me:\n\n✳️ 𝐀𝐈 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐚 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞. It’s a paradigm shift. Build with that mindset.\n\n✳️ 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐲. The best AI products are invisible, intuitive, and impactful.\n\n✳️ 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐈 𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲. You don’t need to be a data scientist, but you do need to understand how AI can supercharge your product thinking. \n\n✳️ 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐚𝐬𝐭! You can’t wait and learn using AI later! Waiting for things to “settle down in AI”, which is an approach some people may be taking, will put you in disadvantage. Get your hands dirty and start today! \n\nMarily’s recommendation was allocate 2 hours per week to play around with the latest AI technology to stay sharp about the category! Are you doing that? \n\nSay “yes” below 👇 if you at least spend 30 minutes per week trying different AI tool?\n\n👉If not, what holds you back?\n👉If you are already doing it, what are the learnings, surprises, disappointments?\n\nIf you’re building AI-native products, this book is your new playbook.\n\nCongratulations, Marily—and thank you for being a force of inspiration to so many of us. 🥳👏🙌\n\nThanks Dan Olsen for bringing us all together and the community you’ve created. 👏👏\n\n #booklaunch #womeninAI #AI #productmanager #productmanagement",

Creating a win-win situation is key in any negotiation so everyone walks away satisfied and excited about what’s ahead. \n\n🔹 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦.\nEvery negotiation is a chance to build trust and alignment; it’s an opportunity to make a long-lasting relationship and unlock future possibilities, not just extract value. This is particularly true about job offer negotiation. You want to start your new job on the right foot.  \n\n🔹 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞.\nStock, bonuses, benefits, and growth trajectory can significantly shift the equation. Understand the full picture before deciding. Also, think about upside potential with the company’s stock options or RSUs. Stock appreciation for public companies and IPO or M&A exist are what form the biggest part of the compensation of those who have a big earn-out. \n\n🔹 𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞—𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞.\nBenchmarking matters. But also consider what you specifically bring to this role—your track record, strategic edge, and timing. That’s what justifies a premium.\n\n🔹 𝐁𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬.\nIf equity, scope, title, flexibility, or location matter more to you than base -- say it. Negotiate multiple factors if you are more open to different types of compensation packages. The best offers come from clear, honest priorities.\n\nTo all the execs and rising leaders out there: if you’re navigating offers right now, I’m happy to share more insights or talk through scenarios.\n\nLet’s get you the right role, the right way.🍀\n\n#ExecutiveSearch #NegotiationTips #AILeadership #HiringExecutives #JobSearchAdvice #LeadershipHiring #CompensationStrategy",

𝐈 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐨𝐨. 😬 \n\nBut I turned that fear into my superpower — and you can too. 🦹 \n\nNext month alone, I’m speaking at 13 events, including the University of California, Berkeley, Pear VC, HBS Women's Association, Plug and Play Tech Center, and Ubiquity Ventures.\n\nIn the past few months, I’ve spoken at Amazon AWS GenAI, Product Leadership Summit, Maven, Guild, and more — some paid, some unpaid; all on topics I deeply care about and have knowledge of and to the audiences that are eager for my thoughts.\n\nNow here's the truth:\nEnglish is my second language. 😍 \nI came to the U.S. for undergrad, and early in my career, public speaking felt impossible.\n\nI vividly remember my first college speech class 🤯  — it took me dozens of tries to deliver a single paragraph. I wasn’t good. Not even close. 🫣 \n\nBut I had two things:\n 🔹 An obsession with growth\n 🔹 A commitment to excellence\n\nI wanted to share my ideas with the world — and I refused to let fear or language barriers stop me. ✋ \n\nToday, I give keynotes to packed rooms. It feels energizing, even effortless. But behind that “ease” is 20+ years of hard work and hard-won lessons.\n\nHere are 5 lessons that helped me become a confident, powerful speaker, especially for those who feel like they’re not “naturals”:\n\n🗣️ 1. 𝐈𝐭'𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐡 (or any language)- It's about clear ideas.\n People don’t remember grammar; they remember impact. Be clear! Be authentic! Say something that matters. \n\n🧘‍♀️ 2. 𝐍𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 - use them as fuel.\nEven the best speakers get butterflies 🦋.

You’re Not Alone.\n\nThe demand for top technical talent is skyrocketing, but the talent pool remains incredibly limited.\n\n📉 The Talent Gap in AI & ML:\n⚡ 1.9 million software developers in the U.S.— less than 1% of the workforce\n⚡ Just ~24K AI/ML engineers in the U.S.\n⚡ Globally, only 500K–700K AI/ML engineers\n⚡ Meanwhile, 97 million AI-related jobs are projected worldwide by 2025\n\nWith fierce competition for talent, how can companies successfully attract and hire AI/ML engineers?\n\n🎯 Andrew R., Talent Partner at Raya Advisory, who has scaled engineering teams (including AI/ML) at Meta, LinkedIn, and The Climate Corporation, shares proven strategies:\n\n✅ Lead with Purpose – Engineers want to work on meaningful projects. Example: Perplexity’s CEO said top AI engineers join them to disrupt Google Search. Your company needs a compelling mission to attract the best.\n\n✅ Expand Sourcing Channels – Go beyond LinkedIn. Tap into universities, boot camps, hackathons, Kaggle, and GitHub.\n\n✅ Leverage Specialized Recruiters – Firms like Raya Advisory specialize in AI/ML hiring, providing access to vetted talent pools.\n\n✅ Invest in Upskilling & Training – Develop internal talent for specialized AI roles instead of relying solely on external hires.\n\n✅ Streamline the Hiring Process – Set clear expectations, eliminate long feedback loops, and drive decisions quickly to avoid losing top candidates.\n\n✅ Over-Communicate – Keep candidates engaged with consistent check-ins.

Here are the key takeaways:\n\n🔹 AI-Powered Hiring: More AI capabilities will enhance sourcing, screening, and candidate communication—making the process faster and more efficient.\n\n🔹 AI in Performance Management: Feedback should be timely and ongoing (think Radical Candor), yet most companies still do performance reviews only 1-2 times a year. Imagine AI-driven sentiment analysis on Slack, emails, and video calls providing real-time coaching to help employees improve continuously. That’s the future.\n\n🔹 Agentic AIs Managing Agentic AIs: Some companies already have AI agents performing tasks—but now, they’re also building AI agents that manage other AI agents. 🤯\n\n🔹 AI & Humans Side by Side: The future of work will involve humans and AI agents collaborating. AI Agents, just like humans, will need to be evaluated, managed, and empowered. This shift requires rethinking company structures & HR systems.\n\n🔹 Still Early Days: Despite the buzz, AI-driven recruiting and talent management tools are still in their infancy—with massive room for improvement.\n\n💡 The takeaway? AI is revolutionizing hiring and talent management, but we are just getting started. Companies that embrace these changes early will have a competitive edge.\n\n👥 It was great reconnecting with Tatyana Mamut, PhD & Zoe Vatanparast and meeting Sydney Levin, Lauren Dickinson, Sahar Alizadeh, Misty Dodd, Samy Movassaghi, PhD, Fanni Gabor, and many more!\n\n👉 Follow Yasi Baiani for more insights on AI & the future of work.\n♻️ Reshare if you found this valuable!\n\n#FutureOfWork #AgenticAI #AIinHR #GenAI #TalentManagement Raya",

Imposter syndrome creeps in no matter how accomplished we are:\n\n🤔 Can I do this?\n🤔 Did I get it right?\n🤔 Am I successful enough?\n\nFor founders and entrepreneurs, these doubts can be even louder as we constantly navigate the unknown. I see this in job seekers and candidates too—many of them exceptional, with stellar resumes, yet one rejection makes them question everything.\n\n💡 So here’s your reminder: You are great. You are enough. You got this.\n\nYesterday, while heading from an Influencer Lunch with top CEOs, CTOs, and CPOs (thank you, Jon Levy!) to my talk on The Future of AI & Humans at Work at AWS Gen AI, I took a moment to reflect on my own journey over the past year and a half as the founder of Raya.\n\nWhen I started this business, my mind was full of questions:\n\n❓ Can I pull this off?\n❓ Does it make sense to turn down a C-level role and build something from scratch?\n❓ Is it rational to leave behind a steady paycheck 💸 and take on all the risks?\n\nLooking back, I’m so glad I bet on myself. \n\nFast forward to today:\n\n✅ Raya has some of the world’s biggest companies as clients.\n✅ Some of the most respected brands want to partner with us.\n✅ Clients trust our small but mighty team to work alongside theirs and drive impact.\n\nBut here’s the truth—this journey wasn’t just about me believing in myself. It was about the incredible people who believed in me from day one. You supported me with ideas, connections, and trust. You made intros to CEOs, founders, and executives who helped turn this vision into reality. \n\nYou know who you are!\n\n🙏 I appreciate YOU. Our success at Raya is because of YOU. 💙\n\nTagging a few of you here—thank you for being part of this journey!\n\nIf you’re questioning yourself today, remember this: Believe in yourself, and others will believe in you too.💯\n\n👉Have you had some doubts in your mind about big decisions in the past?

    "Yasi Baiani's post 3mo ago": "DeepSeek is spooking everyone! Why? 🧕 👻 🫣 \n\nDeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, just launched its latest AI model and its performance is on par or better than OpenAI's ChatGPT. \n\nDeepSeek claims to train its models with less than $6M worth of computing power from Nvidia's H800 chips (cheaper GPUs) while other companies like OpenAI reportedly spent over $100M to develop comparable models. \n\n🔹 The companies that got biggest hit by this news are: \n* OpenAI & Anthropic (the direct competitors with DeepSeek from product and business model perspective -- DeepSeek is offering its AI assist subscription at only $0.5/month versus ChatGPT's at $20/month).  \n* Meta, Google, and Microsoft (All the biggest investors and players in LLMs, but their business models are very different from DeepSeek). \n* Nvidia: the massive demand for its GPUs to build AI is now under question. The company lost $520 billion market cap today with the news of DeepSeek! \n\n🔹 If DeepSeek could use cheaper GPUs and a lot less memory to train its models, Nvidia's future is threatened as other AI players can learn to do the same, and demand for Nvidia's GPUs could drop. \n\n🔹 On the other hand, some analysts are questioning DeepSeek's claims! They believe that $6M isn't a reflection of true costs; they didn't account for all prior research and experiments on architecture, algorithms, and data in that $6M. \n\n🔹 Marc Andreessen, who initially tweeted on 1/24 that DeepSeek is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs and an open-source gift to the world seems to now have a different feeling?! 🤔 Yesterday he tweeted that DeepSeek is AI's Sputnik moment - referring to when Soviet Union beat the U.S. into space with the launch of the first satellite into orbit. \n\nTakeaways from DeepSeek news:\n✅  It's a good reminder that not always the first mover is the biggest winner. \n✅ Many assumed that OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Google will continue dominate the AI market, and there's limited room for smaller players and startups in AI. DeepSeek story was a good wake-up call that the race still continues, it's more fierce than ever before, and there are so many uncertainties ahead about who will be the top winners in the AI market.\n✅ No company is immune in a free market! Not even the largest company in the world like Nvidia or the most well-funded player like OpenAI.  \n\n👉 What's your take on this news?\n👉 What do you think will be the future of AI? \n👉 Who will be the winner of the race? \n\nShare your thoughts below 👇 \n\n#deepseek #AIcompetition #AIfuture #OpenAI #AI #Nvidia",

AI will unlock solutions to critical “jobs to be done,” democratizing advanced technology like never before.\n\n✅ The Rise of Collaborative AI Systems: 2025 will mark a transition from standalone AI models to ecosystems of AI agents working in concert. Multi-agent systems will revolutionize problem-solving, with specialized agents working together to tackle complex challenges.\n\n✅ Balancing Innovation and Regulation: AI Innovation Will Increase Regulatory Scrutiny and Accelerate the Need for Government Cooperation.\n\n✅ AI Agents Become Prime Targets: As AI systems handle critical tasks, they’ll become prime targets for bad actors. Security and trustworthiness will be more crucial than ever.\n\n✅ Challenges for High-Valuation AI Startups: Overvalued AI startups will face a market reality check in 2025. Founders and investors must recalibrate their strategies for sustainable growth.\n\n✅ Foundation Models: They will have slower progress, and smarter Usage.\n\n✅ Lifelong Learning: A Mandate for Leaders: In a world reshaped by AI, curiosity and adaptability are non-negotiable for leaders. Building a culture of continuous learning will be essential for success.\n\n👉 What do you think?\nWhich prediction excites (or concerns) you the most? Let’s discuss in the comments!\n\n👉 Link to the full article is in the comments.\n\n#AI #Leadership #Innovation #FutureOfWork",

That's what will differentiate you from robots and AI agents.\n➡️ If you are interested in climate tech, get in there.\n\n👉 What did I miss?

If anything I’m so grateful for the opportunity to work with such incredible clients and teams. \n\nEarly in December, I promised myself to try to unplug between Christmas and New Year. Soon after, multiple of our clients came to us with the ask to support them for a few time sensitive hires and crafting their 2025 strategic plans.\n\nOur moto at Raya is: customers always come first! 💯\n\nSo I unblocked my calendar and was working most of the last two weeks of the holidays. \n\nMultiple of my team members also decided to work during the holidays to meet our clients’ needs. Thank you team! 🙏💙\n\nNot only we didn’t mind it at all, we felt fortunate to be in the position to work with these incredible clients — many of which are high growth companies with fast pace. \n\nWe ♥️what we do! \n\nSaying all that, I decided to take the next two days fully off to refresh and get ready for a bigger and better 2025 ahead of us. \n\nMy hot take to share:\n\n❇️ Always put your customers first no matter in which function you are in - would it be a founder, c-suite, product, customer success, or engineering.\n\n❇️ If you are an entrepreneur and founder building a business, I see you. I hope you’re  enjoying the ride! 🤩🎢\n\n❇️ Make sure you adjust and adapt to your company’s needs and pace. \n\n❇️ If you go hard at it at times to meet important milestones or deadlines, leave some time to recover and regain your energy. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.🏖️\n\n❇️ Try to position yourself to do things that you truly love and enjoy! That’s when work feels like play.⛹️‍♀️\n\nHappy 2025! \n\n#worklifeharmony #worklifeingration #wokrlifebalance",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 4mo ago": "🎁 My 2025 gifts for all the job seekers. 🥳\n\nIn 2024, my team and I interviewed close to 1,000 people across all the roles we’ve hired for our clients. We placed candidates in VP of Product, VP of Marketing, VP of Engineering and similar roles in some of the hottest AI and other tech companies. \n\nWe all know that this job market is arguably the toughest job market of the last 15 years. \n\n👉 Below, I shared a few tips we observed that helped candidates stand out and land their dream jobs. 🎁\n\n👉 Also, I'm offering 5, 30-minute free calls with myself for resume/LinkedIn profile review and feedback, career advice, or any similar topic. If you are interested, put in comments \"Interested\". In one week, I will do a drawing for the winners. 🎁\n\nTips on how to land your dream job in 2025:\n1) Make sure you build up your LinkedIn profile. Add “skills” under each role you had. Bring the details you have on your resume, to your LinkedIn profile. That way you have the highest chance to stand out in recruiters’ key word searches. \n\n2) Don’t spray and pray. You need to approach your job search strategically and be really targeted. Narrow down the top companies or types of companies you want to go after. Then figure out why and how you can compel them that you are the best candidate for their roles.\n\n3) Network, network, network. Network with people in the companies you want to work for; network with recruiters like ourselves who have access to jobs that never even get posted on any job boards.\n\n4) Visual impact counts. First impressions matter. Make sure you have a solid, high quality picture on your LinkedIn profile. Use a good cover photo that’s illustrative of who you are and your personal brand. \n\n5) Get your story down. Practice and role play with friends. Even if you have been impacted by RIFs or got fired, if you have good reasons and can demonstrate the learnings, everyone understands these things could happen.  \n\n6) Know your elevator pitch and highlight the results you drove. In 5 minutes you should be able to tell a recruiter or hiring manager what you have done, and more importantly the business results you drove; if you can’t, you will lose them.\n\n7) Pay it forward. If you find access to recruiters or hiring managers, refer them another person you know might be a good fit for the role they are hiring for. If you see an interesting role posted on LinkedIn, tag others who might be a fit or send the link to them. The karma will come back to you.  \n\n👉 Anything I missed? If so, please add them below for other job seekers to benefit.\n\nI hope these tips help you approach your job search more strategically in 2025 and land your dream job. 🤩\n\nHappy New Year from all of us at Raya Advisory!\n\n#careeradvice #jobseekers #gethired",

You can embrace it and use it to gain a competitive edge or resist it and fall behind. 🚀  \n\n2) Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, Co-founder of Clerisy Gilt & GLAMSQUAD, reminded us that if you want to build something bigger than yourself, never lose sight of hustling, cold calling/emailing to prospects/partners, and getting up when you fail. Even to date after so much success building multiple companies, she's the one doing cold reachouts to potential partners/clients/talents for her portfolio companies. 👏 \n\n3) Hearing Nina Vaca's story on how to build Pinnacle Group from 0 to $1+bn company with a lot of recognition and accolades -- such an inspiring story. 😍 \n\n4) Hearing Christina Wallace, who's an #HBS Lecturer and (so much more), talking about how to build a Portfolio Life and Career that's a reflection of our various interests and skills. Hint: Read her book and you learn how to do this. 📊 \n\n5) Seeing my HBS friends and meeting my fellow HBSWA board members in real life were the highlights.  Leslie Crowe, Stephanie Swingle, Maria Baibakova, Gulum Williams, Elizabeth Crabill, Heather Myers, Kathleen  A Murray, and many more.  💚 \n\n#HBS #womenleaders #leadership",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 7mo ago": "It's great to be in NYC for another Flybridge Founder Week -- one of my favorite events of the year. \n\nWhat I love about this annual event is that it's packed with high-value contents from founders to founders and the opportunity to meet high-caliber people who are building scalable businesses. \n\nThese have been the highlights of the events for me:\n\n❇ I loved seeing my friend and incredibly inspiring founder, Shiza Shahid, taking the stage and sharing stories about how to build a substantial business, Our Place, in a short few years. Building a 9-digit revenue business and having people like Selena Gomez getting behind your product in 5 years are impressive milestones -- to say the least. 👏 😍 \n\n❇ What she shared very much resonated with me (and I often provide the same advice to companies we work with): In order to build a great business not only you need to have the best products, but all parts of your business including design, operation, customer service, marketing, etc have to work well together in synchrony. You need to keep the bar high on all fronts to keep the momentum and drive results. \n\n❇ It was great to hear the panel of investors from A16Z, Insights Partners, Craft Ventures, and Threshold talking about what they look for in founders and startups for Series A and beyond. The gist of it is that what drives investors' interest is \"sustainable and repeatable growth\". The \"perfect\" founders and companies don't exist. Own your mistakes and focus on building a business and delivering sustainable growth.    \n\n❇ Love hearing some growth hacking tips on marketing and sales processes from James Theuerkauf, Julisa Salas,  Will Greene, and Zach Shefska. \n\n❇ Spending time with people I admire including Jeffrey Bussgang, Chip Hazard, Jesse Middleton,  Katie Kirsch, Zina Ajlouny, and many others was great.\n\nI also very much enjoyed the walking dinner tour last night -- organized by one and only Cherae Robinson. 👏 👏  \n\nP.S. I missed the names of some of the amazing people I met last night/today. \nPlease tag your name below or comment, so we can stay connected. \n\n#founders #entrepneuers",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 7mo ago": "Recently, I had the opportunity to share insights about the executive search process and hiring trends in collaboration with Vidur Dewan (Partner @  Artisanal Talent) and Sam Wallace (Partner @ Wilton & Bain) hosted by one and only Jessica H.. 🤩 \n\nBelow, I shared some of the takeaways from the panel. I hope these help more people who are looking for their next leadership role and trying to navigate the executive search process:\n\n✅ AI roles are surging: Not only there's a high demand for technical AI roles, but also there's an emergence of business AI roles. To take advantage of this trend, engrain yourself into understanding the AI nots and bolts, be the user of AI tools, shape your point of view, and be a champion of change/adopting AI in your organization.  \n\n✅ Leadership roles have been consolidating: We see the emergence of CPTO roles; we also see more companies rolling up product, design, and engineering under one leader, would it be CPO, CTO, or COO. As a leader, work on upskilling your hardskills and sharpen your leadership skills, so that you can take on broader scope. \n\n✅ Middle management is shrinking: From large companies such as Meta and Amazon to smaller players, the organizations are getting flatter with the goal of gaining more efficiencies. Focus on delivering real value and solving real problems to make yourself indispensable.  \n\n✅ Landing a great job is half skills & half story-telling: Only YOU know your own story; you are the best person positioned to help others understand your story and the why behind every career decision. Work on the \"art of story-telling\" to help hiring managers and recruiters understand the greatness in you and your skills. \n\n✅ Networking, networking, networking: That's always been a golden rule for landing a great job. That's even more important given the current imbalanced demand and supply in the job market. So don't just submit resume and hope someone will get back to you; identify and reach decision makers and influencers (internal recruiters, executive search partners, hiring managers, etc).\n\nI'm sure you are reading these and thinking: \"This is a lot of work! How do I do that!?\" I agree these steps need work, but if you approach your job search \"strategically\" and continuously working on your own upskilling (by learning AI and other skills), you will have a much better result in landing your dream job!  \n\n#hiring #executivesearch #recruiting #gethired Raya",

It's great to introduce creativity and unconventional things to make professional events more personal and fun. \n\n❇ The caliber of attendees and how the multi-day summit was organized enabled deep conversations and close connections.

    "Yasi Baiani's post 8mo ago": "Recently, I had the opportunity to share my learnings and insights from \"Launching Products Globally\" with an amazing audience at Plug and Play Tech Center with the presence of global audience including entrepreneurs from \nHKSTP - Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation.\n\nHere are a few learnings and insights from the evening:\n\n1) You need to \"localize\" your product & go-to-market strategy: This doesn't only mean just translating or localizing your product. It's a lot more than that. \nYou need to localize your \"go-to-market\" motion as well. \n\nYou may have product-market-fit (PMF) locally, in the first country/region you launched, but that doesn't mean you can take the same product and go-to-market strategy to launch in a new country/region. As an example at Fitbit, we learned how the French think about fitness (they count walking to a restaurant to get a glass of wine as their \"fitness\") is very different than how Americans define workout and fitness.  So all our marketing and go-to-market strategies had to align with the way locals will see benefits in our products. \n\n2) Having boots on the ground is essential for successful global expansion: You need to have boots on the ground who truly understand the nuances of how to go-to-market, how to sell, and how to deliver your value proposition to customers in different regions. There are a lot of nuances of how to do business locally that will take outsiders to any market a long time to learn. At Cleo, where we had global customers like Salesforce, Redbull, Pepsi, and Uber, we had to have local health Guides to deliver our services with an intimate understanding of customers needs and approaches in that region. \n\n3) Understanding local, cultural, and social aspects is critical to a global expansion success: Even though at the surface things may seem similar in each region, there are a lot of nuances that make your go-to-market strategy and the way you deliver your services resonate with the local customers or not. At Teladoc, we've learned that people in different countries think about their mental health and how to get support for that \"very differently\" than each other. \n\nHuge thank you to my hosts Rahim Amidi, Dr. Yahya Tabesh, Amir Amidi, Ahmadreza Masrour, and Akvile Gustaite, and HKSTP leaders, Albert Wong & Pheona Kan, who are interested in continuing these conversations.\n\nIt was awesome to meet great entrepreneurs and see old friends:  Reza Moghtaderi Esfahani, Daniel Lo, Houman Homayoun, Wayne Chang, Golnaz (Naz) Moeini.\n\n#product #gotomarket #globallaunch #globalbusiness",

This is the first interest rate cut in 4 years. \n\n* This is a jumbo-sized interest rate cut! Fed cut rates by 50-basis-point instead of 25-basis-point which is more common for interest rate changes in an effort to head off a slowdown in the labor market. \n\n* That's great news for job seekers and companies who are eager to open new roles.\n\n* Lower rates are typically associated with a friendlier hiring environment as employers’ bottom lines get a boost from cheaper borrowing costs.\n \n* Not only do lower rates help with a more appealing job market, but they also help the cost of your car, home, and credit card loans be less.\n \n* It's expected that this is the beginning of multiple rounds of rate cuts well into 2025. The very next cut will probably occur after the Presidential election. \n\n#hiring #openroles #recruiting #jobmarket #fed #interestrrate",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 8mo ago": "\"God Mother of AI\", Fei Fei Li, raised $230M for World Lab -- spatial intelligence AI startup.\n\nWhat you need to know and why this is so fascinating:  \n\n💰 This is one of the largest funding rounds for an AI company -- especially as a first round. \n\n🚀  Funding comes from top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, Radical Ventures, NVentures (the venture capital arm of Nvidia), Marc Benioff, and Ashton Kutcher.\n\n🌍  Language models changed how we interact with computers. They enabled software to speak and understand natural languages. However, language is just one way humans reason and communicate. We understand the physical world is spatial -- by seeing images and gestures, walking in spaces, or interacting with things. World Labs aims to create that spatial world via AI. \n\n💻  Per Li, the physical world for computers is seen through cameras, and the computer brain behind the cameras. Turning that vision into reasoning, generation, and eventual interaction involves understanding the physical structure, the physical dynamics of the physical world. And that technology is called spatial intelligence.    \n\n🕶  If World Lab's vision comes to reality, you could imagine taking your favorite book, throwing it into a model, and then literally stepping into it and watching it play out in real time, in an immersive way.\n\n🤖  The most relevant applications of spatial intelligence could be in gaming, visual effects in AR/VR, and robotics (longer-term). \n\nWorld Labs aims to ship its first product in 2025. \n\n* Building a 3D world model is really, really hard; hence, it hasn't been done by any other company yet. It requires overcoming key problems in adjacent but disparate areas such as data, graphics, and AI.\n\n* What to expect? Competition (OpenAI, Figure, and others) will attempt to get into the same domain (if not already have some projects in the work). \n\n👉 What are your thoughts about Worlds Labs vision and ambitions?  \n👉 Will the World Labs team succeed in making spatial intelligence a reality? \n👉 What will be the biggest challenges they have to overcome?  \n\nWorldLabs #artificialintelligence #spatialintelligence",

Invest in #upskilling of your team. Bring in experts to educate your team. \n\n3) Understand the technical opportunities and limitations of AI and ensure to address those in your proposal. Propose a \"phased path\" with a clear timeline, budget, and goals to help your executives understand how your team will go from idea > concept > minimum viable product > and to scaled product. \n\n4) Lay out how you build #responsibleAI offerings and mitigate compliance, privacy, and ethical risks. \n\n5) Testing AI products is different than your typical product. They may need more than your QA. If you build a product for lawyers or doctors, you need those experts to review the model's output. Those types of talent are expensive and they need to be considered as part of your cost and plan. \n\n👉 You can find the link to the full talk in the comments below. \n♻ If you find this post helpful, re-share or like it to help others benefit as well. \n\nThanks, Chilann Chan for executing and bringing this awesome event together. \n\n#AI #productstrategy #AIstrategy #productmanagement #productdevelopment",

I will share stories about: \n\n- How we got executive alignment and support to build Fitbit's Female Health category which was a controversial topic at first since most of male executives couldn't see the big opportunity around cycle tracking and fertility windows -- which ended up being widely adopted and had over 2.4M users in the first month. \n\n- How collaboratively with involving all the functions and leaders at Cleo, I solidified a product strategy and north star to expand beyond female health and early-stage family support to become an end-to-end caregiving company -- unlocked $270B market opportunity for the company. \n\n- How in our work with Raya clients today we help them assess, present, and implement AI strategies and solutions that are right for their organization. \n\nHuge thank you to Maven team and Gagan Biyani for this Influence at Work Series and for including us. Also, a big thank you to Chilann Chan who has supported us behind the scenes to make this a reality. \n\nJoin LIVE on 8/13, 12:00pm.

He earned 1st place in various races, kept beating his time, and ultimately made it to the county to represent his team this coming week.\n\nHe dreamed and worked incredibly hard to make that dream a reality. 🏊‍♂️ 👏 💙\n\nWhat I tried to instill in my two kids it's not just the aim for \"winning\". But rather the “process” that could lead to success and wins in life. 🤔\n\nHere are the elements I share with them often:\n\n✅ Rule #1 for winning is to \"participate\". Never withdraw cause you are guaranteed you won't get far.\n\n✅ Practice makes everything better. Work hard to master your craft. All the talented and successful people in any field work incredibly hard -- think of Rafael Nadal 🎾 or CEOs of Fortune 500 companies 👩‍💻🧑‍💻as examples.\n\n✅ You are the boss of yourself. This is what I learned from Ski Team Coach and Psychologist. Believe in yourself! Bet on yourself! Think positively and get out there to execute!\n\n✅ Every time you fail and lose, bounce back faster, stronger, and with more determination.\n\nThese rules apply in business, life, sports, and anything in between.\n\nWhat are the steps you take to position yourself for success and win? \n\nToday, I'm a proud Mom and take a pause to celebrate this little dude and his perseverance! 😍\n\n#proudmoment #winning #senseofwinning #coaching",

With two little kids and my mother being a stage 4 cancer patient, I knew I couldn't do that type of \"commute to work\".  \n\n* The company had aggressive goals of delivering 3-4x growth through innovation and M&A. In the past, I've delivered those types of growth both through innovation and M&A (hence they wanted me on their team), but I couldn't see that being a rational business goal in this environment.\n\n* I wanted to pursue my #entrepreneurial path which I had put on hold before joining my previous company. I decided that even though the timing may not be perfect (it will never be in some ways), I will move forward with that. \n\nI officially launched Raya and started building the business. Looking back at this one year later, I couldn't be happier about the decision. \n\nHere are the learnings -- hopefully you all can take something to apply to your career decision: \n\n✅ Know your family/life < > work balance criteria and priorities. \n✅  Don't make career decisions based on fears.  \n✅  Do things differently. Don't follow the herds.\n✅  Have a portfolio career model and create alternative revenue streams.\n✅  Be eager to learn and get out of your comfort zone.  \n\nHope you all dare to pursue what's best for you and define your own path, even if that may be different than the conventional or expected paths. \n\n#LIPostingDay\n#careeradvice #careerexperience #paveyourownpath #worklifeharmony #worklifebalance",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 11mo ago": "I had the honor to give a keynote speech at the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business.\n\nBeing a keynote speaker is nerve-racking for many.\n\nFor me, it's exuberating and energizing.  \n \nAt this point in my career,  I developed the skills that made public speaking not only comfortable but truly enjoyable. \n\nSince many asked, me about how I do public speaking so smoothly and comfortably, in a future post, I will share more about how I built skills to deliver a 25-minute keynote speech with absolutely no notes.  \n\nMy talk at the University of California, Berkeley was about \"How to Build a Successful & Resistance Career.\"\n\nBelow, I shared 7 tips with the audience:\n\n1) Find & follow your passion: When you do, work becomes like play and it feels SO good. \n\n2) Ride a growing industry tide: AI wave could be one of the obvious ones. Without realizing it, I got to ride the mobile and wearable waves and they paid off significantly. \n\n3) Dare to fail: Without failure, you won't learn and won't make big leaps. \n\n4) Sprint your way to promotions and growth: See the stats I shared in the presentation, and it will explain it all. This is even more important for women than men.   \n\n5) Build a portfolio career: Apply rule #1 of investment (diversification) to your career. Build multiple revenue streams. \n\n6) Build your personal brand: That way people know your skills and strengths and they will bring you business and opportunities. \n\n7) Have a growth mindset: Our world is changing more rapidly than ever before. Learning new skills and re-inventing yourself is a must-have attitude. \n\nThe talk was a big hit with the audience. \n\nI thought it's timely to share this with the broader audience since it's a graduation season and many are embarking on their new journey.\n\nGraduation is a big milestone and such memorable day. I included pictures from my own graduation from the University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business in 2006 and my students' graduation in 2017 -- when I used to teach Product Management at Haas.\n\nCongratulations to all the new graduates of 2024!  \n\nI wish you a career filled with success, some failure (as Jensen Huang wisely said: that's how you grow and make big leaps), and satisfaction. More importantly, though I wish you a fulfilling life that's filled with happiness, love, and impact.  \n\nA huge thank you to Charu Mehra, Jillian Geary, Briana Steele, Alyssa D'Cunha, P.

That's why they all are focused on a 6 month product strategy versus the traditional 12-24 month product strategy. \n\nThe motto was rapid testing, prototyping, and learning! 👏 👍 \n\nThat's the music to my ears as a product person with a laser focus on customers and the market.   \n\nHuge thank you to one and only, Bonnie Hyun, and the rest of the NYSE team for organizing such an informative and high-impact event together. \n\n#AI #aistrategy #aiinnovation",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 1yr ago": "Looking for a job? Are you getting exhausted in this tough market? \n\nLast night, Sam Wilkins of Riviera Partners and I shared insights on what we see in the market for #product and #AI roles, the candidate-market fit, and how to navigate the current market to land an offer.  \n\nWe had a talented and capable group of product leaders and executives joining us in person from all over the Bay Area. Thank you all for coming.\n\nA few takeaways from the evenings are below:\n\n✳ You and your skills are your product. \nYou need to \"bring\" yourself (just like a product) to the market, position yourself, and market yourself. The clearer you are about why your value proposition as a talent, the easier it is for the hiring manager or recruiter to connect the dots and hire you.  \n\n✳ Everyone has to learn AI no matter what's your function. \nIf you are in product you need to get started soon -- if you haven't already. And you don't need to be an engineer, data scientist, or mathematician to pick up AI. Just do it! ✔ Start today. \n\n✳ Network, network, network! Use referrals in your favor. \nFind people in your network or the company you plan to apply to who can bring your resume to the recruiter's or hiring manager's attention. Otherwise, your resume will be lost among 100s and 1000s of resumes coming in per each open role. \n\n✳ Be focused on your search. \nSpray and pray approach never works well, especially in this market. The best way to navigate your job search and ensure you increase your chances of landing an offer is to narrow down but go all in for those roles. \n\n✳ Be kind to yourself. \nIt's a tough market. Take some time to take care of yourself to recharge and rejuvenate. You don't want to be exhausted and out of battery in interviews.\n\n👉 If you want to be added to Raya's Talent Pool, please fill out our form (link in the comments). \n\n👉 For the link to the full recording of the event, see the comments. \n\nHuge thank you to Jessica H. & Li S. for making this possible. \n\n#recruitingtips #jobsearch #gethired #recruiting",

    "Yasi Baiani's post 1yr ago": "The recent Microsoft & LinkedIn #WorkTrendIndex data on AI’s impact on work has been fascinating. \n\nHere are a few highlights:  \n\n❇  AI impacted the job market dynamics:   \n* The majority (55%) of leaders are hiring are concerned about not enough talents in the market that are up-skilled with AI to fill their open roles.  \n\n* 66% of leaders say they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills.\n\n* 71% say they’d rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. This will give an edge to more junior candidates who are adopting AI rapidly. \n \n* In the US, LinkedIn studies show a 14% increase in job applications per role since last fall.\n\n❇ Professionals aren’t waiting for official guidance or training—they’re skilling up.\n* In the past 6 months, the use of LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals.\n* Employees across every age group from Boomers to Gen Z are bringing their own AI tools to work.\n\n❇ Leaders' #1 concern is cybersecurity and data privacy:\n* 78% of AI users bring their own AI tools to work (BYOAI)—it’s even more common at small and medium-sized companies (80%).  \n* 52% of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks.\n\n🤔 What do you think about these insights? What do you see in the market?

In many companies, instead of having product managers who bring customer and market understanding to their work, they have project managers. These companies typically have more of a feature team versus empowered product teams that bring substantial value to the business.  \n\n📌 Emily shared a lot of great tactical PR tips. She's also been transparent about Six Eastern's pricing and what founders should expect when working with PR agencies. I highly recommend founders listen to this episode to learn about 1,2,3 of PR.  \n\n📌 Per Boz, at Meta, Zuck is still intimately involved not only in laying out the product vision and strategy but also in the weeds of product experience. This reminded me of Brian Chesky's approach at Airbnb.  \n\nBoz shared that many founders have regretted delegating too much of product decisions. He believes the most critical thing is for the founders and execs to recognize what things matter and sweat over them -- even if they feel small or too much in the weeds to others. That's the leadership approach at Meta that Zuck, Boz, and Chris Cox practice.  \n\n👉 If you've listened to these episodes what were your takeaways?\n\nAnd on another note: \n👉 When do you listen to your podcasts and audiobooks?\n👉 What do you listen to these days when working out? \n\nShare your thoughts in the comments. \n\n#productleadership #productmanagement #product",

Just because an  opinionated ‘influencer’ who works as a bartender believes vaccines are bad for you does not make vaccines bad.\n\nPeople spend years becoming experts for a reason. Opinionated people are not experts—they are just loud.\n\nSelected excerpt:\n“What doing your own research should mean is that you should talk to, or at least look at online, people who have an expertise in the field, which doesn’t mean looking in chat rooms or just on social media blog posts,” Dr. Offit, a medical expert said. He added that while there is good information available, “there’s also a lot of really bad sources of information that will miseducate you about your choice. And Robert F.

Sesame does not accept health insurance, as patients directly pay provider fees.  \nFor $29.00 cash or card, Costco members now can see a doctor for all their primary care needs. \n\nNo doubt the experience will be quick, convenient and of course, cost effective. And just like that, Costco is in the health care delivery business!\n\nThese moves offer retailers more customer connection opportunities — and the potential to further compete with the traditional healthcare system.  \n\nNow all of your favorite ‘non-health care organizations’ like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon are competing for your attention and your money!!\n\nSo you decide which business is better for your health needs, cuz for my money (and in my opinion), I’m betting Costco (and these others) will do the job right and at the right price!",

Because there are no nurses around to check on the correctness of what the doctors and pharmacists have ordered. \n\nSee, in the hospital, almost all medication errors are caught by nurses, so the patient can be safe. But in the home, there are no nurses to make sure you (as the patient) have received the right medication at the right dose…\n\nSo it makes sense to start understanding how big the pharmacy errors are, so this is an important first-step in patient safety.\n\nAnd remember—just because the pharmacist gives you your medication, doesn’t mean it’s correct! Double check all of your medications before you take them.",

Which is one reason why staff and doctors think these patients are not too sick and then why these patients often are left alone in the ER for too long, only to become deathly ill.\n\nI spent 20 years of my career working on improving sepsis care which is why these new findings are so alarming. \n\nTakeaway: If you or your loved one is sick or seems ‘off,’ go to the ER and make a big fuss until the doctors or nurses consider sepsis.\n\nTrust me when I say that someone’s life depends on it.",

I ran to feel good, I ran to reduce stress, I ran to calm myself, I ran to maintain my weight…\n\nBut I didn’t always want to go running, so I had to come up with a way to ‘talk myself into it.’ I came up with my mantra—a saying I repeat to myself as a motivator. It worked: The mind gives out before the body.\n\nI turned my thinking from running being a ‘bummer, or burden,’ to something I was grateful for ‘getting to do.’ My body was able, and strong and I was healthy. I needed to be grateful, not grumpy.\n\nMy mantra gave me strength while running. But over the years, I used this mantra to help me overcome obstacles at work and with different relationships too.\n\nThis mantra became a source of resilience—it became my source of positive self-talk. I was my own cheerleader cheering me on to accomplish the task at hand. And at times in my career, I needed a cheerleader.\n\nOver the years I’ve come up with additional mantras, other ‘pro-me’ talking points to help me in my career and in my daily life.\n\nEarly on I learned (by accident) that positive self-talk and positive statements (mantras) are powerful. And they grow more powerful every time they are spoken-whether or not you are the only one who hears it!\n\nDo you have a mantra? What is it? When do you use it? How has positive self-talk helped you in your career?",

Less convenience. Less services. Less access—not just for women. But for many services. Why? Because the healthcare industry will decrease overall services to weather the economy headwinds and staffing shortages that are predicted to stick around for another several years.\n\nThis is not a bright forecast.

(Which I eventually did in a prestigious journal…)\n\nHowever, after reading my early drafts my boss told me that I was bad at writing. Additionally though, he also said that I needed to get better at writing and offered to pay for a writing coach.\n\nIn that one conversation I went from feeling dejected and lost, to feeling like there was a ‘way out’ from being bad at something. Had this boss only provided the negative feedback without a ‘life line,’ then I would have been doomed.\n\nI often contrast that conversation with a different boss, who told me my analytics skills were weak and that if I didn’t find time outside of work hours to improve, I’d be let go.\n\nNot all feedback is helpful and can be very destabilizing.\n\nSo provide advice rather than feedback, because, unlike feedback which is looking in the rear view mirror, advice is guidance for the future.\n\nAnd honestly, insights regarding the past is only useful if applied into the future.",

Yup. They are, in many respects, equivalent…sorry docs…\n\nAnd these highly trained, independently licensed providers are in great need, especially since there is a huge shortage of docs—and a growing shortage, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nSo what a gift this is to all Americans from the Ester Lauder Foundation, to support medical training for NPs.\n\nSelected Excerpt:\n\n“Now more than ever, the country needs greater and more equitable access to quality primary care — and highly skilled nurse practitioners are the key to making that happen.”",

Huh? Uhh, no thank you. Why would I, as a sick patient, who is not at the top of my ‘immune response game,’ want to be around actively infected staff?\n\nThere was a time, decades ago, when hospitals were dangerous places: infection rates were high, medical errors were high and the trained workforce was not so fantastic.\n\nBut that is the complete opposite of hospitals today: hospitals have highly specialized workers, strong safety and excellent quality of care.\n\nHowever, if actively sick and highly infectious workers are allowed to go into the hospital environment, then all of this process will backslide.\n\nExecutives making these short-sighted decisions are risking their institution’s reputation: community members will worry if the hospital is a safe place to go for care, surgery and other critical needs—now and into the future.\n\nAllowing actively infectious workers into the hospital is bad policy, both short and long term.",

Because those labeled as schizophrenic are immediately associated hopelessness, dangerousness, and erratic behavior.\n\nTruth is, those labeled with any mental health issues are often burdened with greater difficulties in getting healthcare services, due to being ‘discounted’  by healthcare providers. \n\nSo re-labeling diagnoses is a good idea. And there is precedence: The illness once known as manic depression was successfully relabeled bipolar disorder in 1980. “Mental retardation” became “intellectual disability” in 2013.\n\nReducing stigma in healthcare is critical because one of the main tenants for healthcare professionals is to be non-judgmental. \n\nAnd frankly, as a whole, our medical society is falling short in this regard—whether it’s mental health or body autonomy, healthcare is becoming too political and too patriarchal.\n\nHealthcare professionals are in service to patients’ diseases and medical conditions.\n\nTime for healthcare professionals to become the unbiased advocate and champion of our patients.",

There are tons of plans. Most are rated well, which waters-down the rating system. It’s difficult to know which plan might be better. \n\nAnd services and costs vary widely for the same medications and same services.\n\nAnd advertisers and brokers want to enroll you to their Medicare plan—because they make money off of you.\n\nFor 2019, 71 percent of beneficiaries said they didn’t compare plans during the open enrollment period. The rate was even higher among Black and Hispanic beneficiaries, people over 85 and those with lower income and fewer years of education— precisely the groups most likely to require more medical services and drugs, and least able to pay high costs.\n\nSo do yourself or your loved ones a solid, and use those helpful and free services (found in this article) that help people choose the right plan. Real people will answer the phones and help.

Why was it made? Is this addressing real clinical or patient needs?\n2. Are there studies and clinical trials to back those claims?\n3. Do both patients and clinicians gain information?\n4. Is this helping to form a better relationship between patients and healthcare professionals?\n5. Can we use our existing devices to access the new features?\n6.

Marks immediately took action when the books were pulled and started Operation Caged Bird to buy the books that had been removed and hand them out to midshipman. Hundreds of alumni, some now active duty military leaders wrote letters and signed petitions, stating their objection and those efforts had an impact. \n\nHow was this efficient? Forcing staff at USNA to remove hundreds of specific titles, professors having to adjust their teaching curriculum and bringing into question the quality of college education at what is known as one of the nation's finest colleges. Many professors quit or retired early in protest causing the academy to need to find and hire new educators.  \n\n\"Move fast and break things\" is a philosophy in tech. So is \"fail fast.\"  Not so much in our military. The action taken at the Naval Academy did damage. More damage than is known by most. Midshipman were harmed in this debacle. Some are still facing repercussions for simply picking up a book and reading it's pages, for daring to exercise a freedom that is a cornerstone of our democracy. \n\nThis is in no way \"great\" now nor is it a reminder of a similar action in the past that was \"great.\"\n\nPeaceful protest works, courageous actions are worthwhile and very, very American. 🇺🇸",

The Trump administration and Republicans are making it harder for low income Americans to get an education. This also impacts adults who want to go to college later in life but already have children to support. \n\nI went to school on academic scholarships, Pell and SEOG grants and student loans. It was hard to work and take 12 credits but I did it, sometimes I took 15 credits but my advisor and professors said it was too much and some school didn't allow more than 12 credits per semester. \n\nMost Americans can't afford tuition to attend college full time and their parents can't either. How is it beneficial to anyone but billionaires to have Americans who are capable intellectually but lack the funds to obtain a college degree?\n\n Colleges will suffer without students and financial aid to pay professors. \n\nHow is this making America great?",

There are no exceptions.  Especially when considering people who are already suffering, have few resources and are in danger. \n\nI wasn't raised Catholic but in a very all encompassing Christian community. The words Pope Francis spoke over and over are what I was taught and what I saw examples of from my immediate family and community. I memorized the words of Jesus from the time I could speak.\n\nPerhaps this is why I am so baffled at the new exceptions there seem to be in Christianity. \n\nA lack of respect for the earth God made for us, getting angry at anyone who dares to mention we should try to preserve and take care rather than destroy majesty and habitats, for riches and resources. \n\nThe level of cruelty and lack of basic human respect in policies and beliefs regarding people seeking refuge in this country. Jesus would say to provide refuge, food, resources. If you profess to be a Christian, how do you also hold a firm belief in making them leave, calling them criminals and not giving them the opportunity to prove otherwise. \n\nDenigrating children who want to be called a name other than the one they were born with. Telling them they can't dress in the way they are comfortable. \n\nFiring teachers for displaying signs that say \"All are welcome here\" because of laws created to punish people who are viewed as less deserving. \n\nTaking away resources from starving and sick children and adults. Taking medicine and making life saving treatment available only to those who can afford it. \n\nThese actions are the antithesis of Christianity and the words Jesus spoke. \n\nIf you are a Christian and support these actions, how do you square it with the teachings of Jesus?  #popefrancis #christianity #jesus #america",

We see the tenacity, drive and independence from the beginning. We do the best we can to nurture them thinking we know the obstacles they will face. The world isn't always impressed or willing to embrace girls and women who are fearless. We know very well this is perceived as a threat by many. \n\nStill, deep inside we dare to hope things will be different for our daughters. We try not to let our fears quell their belief that they are free to be who they are, to achieve, to soar. It's a hope tempered by the recognition of the hardships they will also endure. We wonder if the world will dull their spirit and crush their belief in what is possible. The way we handle being a woman in the world becomes more important because we know they are watching. \n\nThe countless tears of pride I have shed, amazed and in awe I had any part in a human exhibiting such fearlessness isn't about me and my child. The emotions are so big because she is a living example of possibility against all odds. \n\nHer great grandmother was betrothed at age 7 to a 12 year old boy she had never met. My grandmother started a successful business but wasn't allowed to open a bank account in her own name. My mother chose to keep me and be a single mom in 1969 despite the stigma and ridicule for her choice. Seemingly small actions taken by generations and millions of women we don't even know, made her accomplishments possible. \n\n Nicole Malachowski made it possible for my daughter.  The women who inspired her and dared to take action to stand up to power structures because they simply wanted to be who they are, should be recognized and applauded. They mean the world to me.\n\nWomen everywhere need to take a stand against this and all efforts to stop others from achieving their dreams and being who they are. \n\nMake no mistake, the purpose of this is to make women afraid so they are who others want them to be. I will never comply and I will always speak the names of heroes. \n\n#freedom #airforce #leadership #femalepilots #entrepreneurship #usmilitary #womenwholead",

    "Michelle Chaffee's post 1mo ago": "Spring has sprung\nThe tulips have opened\nThe robin has sung\nThe sun has spoken\n\nI wrote this poem when I was 6 years old, way before I or anyone, knew I have autism spectrum disorder. \n\nI am not the only person with autism who can write a poem, have a job (I've been working since I was twelve) maintain relationships, play sports, go to college, start businesses and raise children. \n\nI was only diagnosed two years ago after an accident and concussion brought me to neurocognitive testing. The neuro psychiatrist said I mask very well. No wonder, I thought, I've been doing it since I started kindergarten and realized the other kids seemed to have the map and key to a universe I felt I didn't belong in. \n\nThe diagnosis explained why I avoided going to birthday parties as a child for fear a balloon might pop and the sound was unbearable. \"Will there be balloons mom?\" I would always ask when the invitation came. Fourth of July fireworks threw me into a complete meltdown and my poor mom couldn't figure out why I didn't find them fun like my cousins did. \n\nI was a weird kid. I spent hours and hours drawing house blueprints and rarely spoke in class all the way through high school. Some fellow classmates actually asked my one friend if I was unable to speak. I have been asked \"why are you so literal?\" more times than I can count and became an expert observer so I could act more like \"normal\" people. \n\nAppearing socially normal takes a tremendous amount of energy and I've found the older I get, the less I care about fitting in but I still at times feel the way I did that first day of kindergarten. When in groups of new people or even presenting my tech solution to company leaders. I've done it so often now, I have a full toolbox and manage just fine but the energy drain is real from the mental gymnastics that are still running in the background.\n\nI know for some, autism makes functioning in this world extremely difficult and far more challenging than I have experienced. I want more understanding and acceptance of people who are autistic. I want to know myself what makes me the way I am. What made my father, who I suspect was autistic, the way he was.\n\nMy dad was a member of MENSA and an artist. He told me he always felt different and that how he was different seemed like it wasn't a good thing. School in the 1950s damaged his self esteem and he thought himself not smart until he took an IQ test in his 40s. He dreamed of being a dentist but hadn't thought he was smart enough. That loss makes me sad for the dream he didn't pursue and was more than capable of achieving. \n\nBetter research and understanding of the differences in how autistic people think and view the world helps eliminate the negative stigma. \n\nPerpetuating ridiculous false narratives sets us behind rather than helping us move forward. \n\nA world where curiosity and acceptance for the ways we all think, communicate and create is one that makes room for the gifts we all possess, to flourish.",

Teachers that encouraged me to seek knowledge and think critically. \n\nOne of the most foundational was my high school history teacher who recently passed away. Evan Swanson loved history, his passion for it was unmistakable to all who were blessed to be in his classroom. \n\nHe taught us about the foundation of this country. The miraculous and the abhorrent. I learned about Japanese internment camps, the civil rights movement and the forced attempts to strip Native Americans of their culture and identity. I was one of several generations in my family to attend a private Christian boarding high school. In fact, Mr. Swanson taught my mother history at the very same school. She too, modeled seeking knowledge and being an engaged citizen. \n\nBeing a Christian didn't mean ignoring or denying truth. We were encouraged to have open conversations about how we saw the world and how we felt about current events. I was taught it was imperative to know everything one could about a situation to make an informed decision. \n\nDuring our senior year, turning 18 and exercising our right to vote was celebrated. Mr. Swanson made sure anyone who wanted to vote, was registered and would have transportation to get to the polling location. \n\nWe were made aware of how many around the globe did not have the same rights we had and that our choices mattered. Our democracy worked best when we all participated. Open political debates and respect of the process and one another was modeled and encouraged. \n\nNow, more than ever before, I am so very grateful for access to information and great minds who shared their wisdom and integrity with me and so many others. \n\nI can't believe I am seeing a nation where books are banned from some of our most esteemed learning institutions and witnessing actions by leaders that mimic dictatorships. I am profoundly sad and disgusted this is happening. I also see the great gift I have been given to know it is wrong and to understand violations of our constitution when they are happening. \n\nWe all move through the world having been shaped by so many. At this time in my life, the impact of this particular teacher is something I am increasingly aware of and will never take for granted.  \n\nThank you to all the teachers who love teaching, model courage and make young people feel valued. There is truly no greater calling. You matter more than you may realize.",

We wouldn't stand by while freedoms some of us have known our entire lives, are stripped away. We are Americans, we understand how important freedom of speech, the press and due process are. We wouldn't give it up without a fight. \n\nBut here we are. \n\nI understand how it happened now. Self preservation is a far stronger human drive than I realized. Stronger than our quest for freedom or ability to prioritize something greater than ourselves. This is why the heroes stand out. They are rare. \n\nI thought I knew what I would do if put in the situation the German people found themselves in. I would surely speak out. I wouldn't quietly comply, I couldn't possibly stand myself if I did. I would probably have been killed, I thought. \n\nIt's early and also time is running out. It's horrible to be put in a place where our courage or cowardice is forced to be on display.\n\nBut here we are.",

She felt as if she were standing on the edge of a precipice with her hair blown back; she was about to grasp something that just evaded her. There must be another life, here and now, she repeated. This is too short, too broken.\"  ~Virginia Woolf\n\nSo much around us is wrong. The greed, cruelty, selfishness, joy in the suffering of others, deceit, denial, gaslighting, praising those who harm while mocking demonstrations of and desires for empathy and compassion. We know this is wrong and that we've gotten lost. We feel it in our bones. \n\nIt's been flipped on its head for so very long. Long before me or my grandmother, my great great grandmother all told to be small, quiet, in the background. Taught to doubt our intuition and that when we are fully ourselves without veil or filter, we are \"too much.\"  What they mean to say is \"too powerful.\" \n\nIt's okay if you read this and feel afraid or uneasy or even angry. A call to action is bound to untether and even a soul seeking freedom can experience hesitation on the first step. Especially a step so monumental it moves entire generations forward and crumbles outdated and wholly dysfunctional systems. \n\nLike it or not, we are all here now. This moment annihilates the concept of neutrality. It pushes us to choose a side and I don't mean a political party. It's bigger than that. It's a \"come to Jesus\" moment if you believe. It's keeping hold of your moral compass and mustering courage and a voice you may not have fully known you possessed. It's a nudge outside your comfort zone but into the light.\n\nA baby step or giant leap are both fine. Sometimes the best step is inward as it's been so easy to become disconnected from who we truly are. From what we know is right. \n\nIt's the only way we will be ready to rebuild if what has been, is turned to ash. \n\nFind your joy, your power, your fierce, your ancestors, your highest self.

Sure, we want to show up and show off our business pursuits and accomplishments on LinkedIn and I completely get that.  But leadership is also about service to the community and an integral part of the fabric of life design.  I took a leap into the deep end to participate in Plymouth Housing's annual event, Seattle Dances with Stars, to raise awareness and needed funds for housing to support those facing chronic homelessness.  I'm dancing Bollywood and Bhangra and the competition is on March 11th.  I would love your support here to win for Plymouth and because I'm competitive.  We also win based on the total number of supporters.  So my ask is that you consider contributing and any amount is awesome!  The more people that lean into this crisis, the stronger the movement for change!  Thank you with deep gratitude! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g5PWr33E\n\nspecial shoutout to Mark Sims and Fikes for leaning is as a sponsor for me!",

Well, this year, I decided to create one and share it with all of you and hopefully you will share it with someone close to you.  It is called \"Your World 2023:  Build your roadmap for business and life success\".  It is a fillable .pdf that you can purchase (at any price you want) here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/dz-zqNyN\n\nAlso, 100% of the proceeds from this workbook will go directly to Plymouth Housing, an organization committed to eliminating homelessness, helping people stabilize and thrive.  Now, more than ever, we need to support these causes.  Join me!!!\n\nThank you all for helping make 2022 a years of change and opportunity.

What’s your tip for driving effective meetings?\n\nMeetings should serve one of these 3 purposes: decide, brainstorm, inform.\n\nDecide meetings are typically tied with an inform component. They’re the most expensive meetings of the three as senior stakeholders are usually involved. Pro-tip: preread with outlined recommendations is a must. \n\nBrainstorm meetings typically are needed to get to the decide stage. Responsible individuals are brought together to develop a proposal or set of recommendations. Pro-tip: agenda of discussion points and designated facilitator to capture AIs is a must. \n\nInform meetings should be brief and succinct. Ideally, these are kept to a minimum unless they’re combined with a decision-making or brainstorming component. Pro-tip: outside of a crisis or warroom, keep inform meetings to a minimum. Always track AIs from these meetings to drive delivery and accountability.\n\n#meetings #leadership",

Top volunteering activities food collection and distribution, fundraising, and tutoring.\n\nA common question I often get is how and when do you start giving back. Where do you start? Do nonprofits and charities prefer donations or volunteers? Should you focus on local or national organization?\n\nLike many things in life and work, it depends. I always recommend starting with why you want to give back. Focus on the types of causes you are passionate about before you narrow down on the how. Start small and build up with short-term commitments like a weekend volunteer events. Then go deeper with long-term commitments over the span of several month. If volunteering time is a challenge, consider reading about nonprofits that focus on causes you care about to donate and amplify their work. \n\nAn observation I’ve seen with nonprofits I am apart with is the social aspect of volunteering. Consider doing it with a group of friends or check out if your company is hosting/sponsoring any local volunteering opportunities. \n\nIf you plan to make a donation, do some research to see if your company runs any giving or matching program. Especially during this time of the year and on Giving Tuesday, which lands on November 29th this year. For example, Airbnb provides employees with paid volunteer time and will double match employee donations during this year’s Giving Tuesday. And Google runs an annual Holiday Giving program that enables Googlers to dedicate donation waivers to nonprofits of their choice.\n\nNo matter how you choose to give back, remember that your way of paying forward is uniquely your own. Impact is measured in quality and intent. \n\nI hope you’ll join me in giving back in your very own way this coming holiday season. Share how you’re planning to give back this year below. I’ll start with my very own in the comment. \n\n#community #nonprofits #givingtuesday",

Through her ability to pick up English fluently, she was the only one in her family to graduate from high school. Excited to plan the next chapter of her life, Sarahi went to her guidance counselor for guidance in navigating the college process.\n\nInstead of guidance, her counselor informed her that \"people like you\" don't go to college, instead they drop out and work instead. Knowing she won't be able to afford college without aid, Sarahi started working cash jobs and soon found out about in-state tuition for undocumented students and scholarships from local non-profits.\n\nIn 2015, Sarahai won a competition that granted her $100K to develop a mobile app. Through her winnings, she developed Dreamers Roadmap which was a database for students to learn and find scholarships geared specifically toward them. To date, this app has helped over 20,000 students go to college. 📚\n\nRead More:",

Your voice doesn’t have to. \n\nIn the early days, I knew some of the editors in LinkedIn’s New York office. They would often hand select and promote my posts to a much wider audience beyond my own network. \n\nThese were the ones they felt were thoughtful, original, and honest—not the ones that followed some formula. Like my very first viral article, “Why Apple owes my mom a huge thank-you”, where I shared the story of my mother cashing in her government bonds so she could buy my first computer when I was 13 years old. \n\nAnd while the “human editors” (their term, not mine) have ceded to the algorithm most of the decisions around what content gets that extra boost, at the end of the day, people still click on and engage with content that resonates with them, that they learn from, that inspires them, that they feel is worth sharing.\n\nAnd that’s not something you can achieve by “gaming the system.”\n\nImpressions fade. Impact lasts. \n\nWrite for people, not the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n➡️ What do you think? How much weight do you place on understanding and trying to write and post content that fulfills the supposed requirements of the algorithm?\n\n🔔Please follow or connect with me for more of my takes on work, life, and everything in-between.",

Write better. Lead better. \n\nIt gives you more ideas to work with, more ways to connect the dots, and more language to express your point of view. \n\nThe people who can shape a conversation, influence a room, or rally a team are often the ones who’ve spent years soaking up ideas from others.\n\nSmartphones and social media have made this harder. They’ve trained us to live in five-second loops. Attention spans are shrinking.  I’m guilty of falling into the occasional doomscrolling black hole like anyone else. \n\nBut this is something worth fighting. If you want to do meaningful work, if you want to fill your mental fuel tank, you need to reclaim your ability to focus.\n\nThat starts with practice. Find the environment or time of day that helps you concentrate.\n\nUse whatever hacks work for you to tune out the noise—both around you and in your own head. \n\nAnd when you can, try to get into a state of deep focus, or “flow”. That’s where real learning—and real progress—happens. \n\nWhen I enter a state of flow, I lose track of  everything around me, silence that annoying voice that’s nagging me inside my head, and even momentarily forget whatever physical ailments I might be dealing with at the moment. Ironically, I only realize I’ve entered a state of flow once I snap out of it. \n\nBooks—especially good nonfiction—compress decades of experience into hours of insight. \n\nThat’s leverage. And it’s available to anyone, every day. \n\nWhen you think about it, it’s also tremendously cost efficient, especially if you compare it to the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars that a four-year university education costs (in the U.S., at least). Since earning my formal degrees decades ago, I’ve probably earned a few additional bachelor’s or master’s degrees in various topics just by reading. \n\nStart small if you need to. A few pages of a book a day. Two or three articles a week. But start. And keep going.\n\nWhat about audiobooks? They’re a good source of information and allow you to multitask while you absorb them. You can “read” and drive at the same time. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nBut what I’m talking about here is the practice of reading the “old-fashioned way”. Active reading exercises mental muscles that listening just doesn’t. \n\nIn a noisy, distracted world, focused reading is a competitive advantage.\n\nBecause your mind is your greatest asset.\n\nAnd how you shape it is up to you.\n\n\n➡️ What do you think?

After cutting his teeth in corporate tech, he co-founded Gogolook, a company that developed a caller ID and spam blocking app called Whoscall. His company was acquired by Korean internet giant Naver in 2013.\n\nA few years later, after connecting on LinkedIn, he invited me to his startup community to speak about building a personal brand.\n\nThis was a time when SparkLabs Taiwan was just an idea percolating in his head. \n\nWhen he finally made the leap and launched the Taiwan arm of Korea-based SparkLabs back in the summer of 2018, I would often find him grinding away on his laptop at random coffee shops around town and responding to emails at absurdly late hours (something his COO confirmed to me he still does today). \n\nSince those scrappy early days, Edgar has poured 10,000+ hours into coaching over 100 founders through the relentless pace of startup life: pressure-testing business models, securing funding, building teams, launching MVPs, and scaling globally. \n\nNow? SparkLabs Taiwan is a respected powerhouse in angel investing and startup acceleration backed by institutional funds, corporate VCs, and government partners.\n\nWhile AI giants like Nvidia dominated headlines at Computex in Taipei this week, a lesser known but perhaps even more compelling story is happening in rooms like today's Demo Day. \n\nThese companies, run by a handful of determined founders with deep industry experience and impressive academic pedigrees, will likely emerge as tomorrow's unicorns, tackling humanity's biggest challenges in health, climate, finance, and AI.\n\nThe next Nvidia, Stripe, or OpenAI might have pitched today.\n\nTaiwan's startup ecosystem is heating up. \n\nEdgar Chiu is the catalyst making it happen.\n\nWatch this space. 🚀",

You’ve written papers, taken exams, given presentations. But if there’s one skill that will quietly shape the arc of your career—no matter what field you enter—it’s the ability to write clearly.\n\nNot academically. Not to impress a professor. But to explain, persuade, and connect.\n\nWriting well forces you to think clearly. If you can’t explain something in simple terms, it probably means you don’t understand it yet. Clear writing reveals sharp thinking. And people notice.\n\nEarly in your career, it might mean sending a follow-up email that actually gets read. Writing a memo that helps your boss make a better decision. Drafting a client note that earns trust. Later, it might mean writing a proposal, a keynote, or even a company-wide message that sets direction and inspires action.\n\nI’ve written often on LinkedIn about the power of writing, and I’ll be returning to the topic soon to go deeper. It’s that important. Because no matter how much the world changes, the fundamentals of good writing still matter.\n\nAnd yes—at this point, most of us are using generative AI in some form. That’s a reality of today’s work. But here’s what I’ve learned in the two and a half years since ChatGPT first turned the writing world upside down: the core principles of strong writing haven’t disappeared. If anything, they’ve become more essential.\n\nIf you want your GenAI-assisted writing to land the way you intend—to persuade, to inform, to connect—you need to understand what makes writing work. You need to know what makes it human. Structure, clarity, tone, pacing, rhythm, voice—these are skills you still need to learn and practice.\n\nGenAI is a powerful tool. It can help you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page. But it doesn’t replace the spark of originality, the nuance of intention, or the emotional depth that only a human being—at least for now—can provide.\n\nYou don’t need to be a great writer. You need to be a clear one.\n\nAnd that’s a skill worth mastering.",

Someone just landed a job at a top firm. Someone else got into a prestigious grad school. A classmate launched a startup. Another is traveling the world.\n\nYou scroll through it all and wonder: Did I miss something? Am I too late?\n\nYou’re not.\n\nYou’re just beginning.\n\nGraduation isn’t the end—it’s the beginning. Everyone moves at a different pace. Some people make fast progress. Others take time to find their path. What matters is not how quickly you move, but that you keep moving forward.\n\nA few years into a communications role, I remember feeling stuck. Four years in, I wasn’t getting the chance to take on bigger responsibilities. I saw people around me getting promoted and moving into leadership roles, and I questioned whether I was being left behind.\n\nEventually, I shared my thoughts with my managers. They listened and gave me the opportunity to move into a more senior role—one that gave me greater visibility and allowed me to grow.\n\nTwo years after that, a major leadership position opened up. I stepped forward and made the case for why I was ready. After a series of conversations with senior leadership, I was offered the role—with expanded regional responsibility and a team to lead.\n\nIt took me a full eight years from the time I joined my firm to earn that first major leadership position. It didn’t happen all at once. It came after years of doing the work, speaking up, and being ready when the moment came.\n\nEveryone’s path is different. Some people take longer to find the right fit. Some grow quietly before they’re seen. Some only realize in hindsight how much progress they were actually making.\n\nSo if you feel like you’re not where you’re supposed to be, press the pause button for a moment and reflect on the skills you’ve acquired, the people you’ve met, and the accomplishments you’ve racked up so far—no matter how “small” they may appear to be. \n\nYou’re not behind.\n\nYou’re just getting started.",

Impressive title. Big-name company. High salary. Great culture. Clear path to promotion. But here’s the truth: that job probably doesn’t exist—at least not yet.\n\nAnd more importantly, chasing it too early can actually slow you down.\n\nInstead, chase skills. Look for roles where you’ll learn fast, stretch your abilities, and get exposure to people who are doing things you admire. \n\nThe job that grows you the most in your first few years may not look glamorous on paper. But it’s the one that builds your foundation.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, I worked for three years at a multinational ad agency in Taiwan. It was my first real job. I hadn’t planned on going into advertising—I saw it as a temporary stop before applying to law school back in the U.S. But it ended up being one of the most formative chapters of my early career.\n\nI learned how to serve clients. How to translate creative ideas into clear briefs for designers. How to prepare budgets, issue invoices, and keep projects moving. \n\nI learned how to manage people up, down, and sideways. I also learned how to prepare and deliver a client pitch—one that helped us win one of our biggest accounts in Asia. And I got my first taste of using thought leadership to raise visibility, when my boss asked me to write an article about the internet, which at the time I had only read about and had never even used.\n\nThat job didn’t have a fancy title and the salary? Barely survived on it. But it taught me how to operate in the real world—and how to make myself useful in any situation. Those skills formed the basis for everything that came after.\n\nCareers aren’t built by chasing status. They’re built by accumulating momentum.\n\nSkills compound. A role where you learn to write clearly, present with confidence, manage a project, or handle pressure will serve you well, wherever you find yourself, whatever you do. \n\nWhen you optimize for growth instead of comfort, doors open. The job you want five years from now may not even exist yet—but the skills you start building today will shape whether you’re ready when it does.\n\nIt’s not about where you start. It’s about what you build where you are.\n\nDon’t worry so much about getting everything right. Focus on getting better. \n\nThe “perfect job” isn’t something you find—it’s something you grow into. Sometimes, it’s something you create yourself.\n\n\n\n➡️What’s a time when you took a job early in your career that wasn’t exactly what you wanted, but you learned new skills that helped you later in your career?

But now that structure disappears. And here's what becomes crystal clear pretty quickly: you're on your own now.\n\nThat might sound scary, but it's actually liberating.\n\nBecause once you stop expecting someone else to figure things out for you, you stop sitting around waiting—and you start making things happen. You stop hoping the perfect job will find you, or that the right mentor will magically appear. You start creating your own opportunities.\n\nYears ago, before everything was digital, my firm published an internal print magazine featuring stories from our offices worldwide. Our Taipei office had just hit a major growth streak thanks to a new strategy we'd launched, and I thought it would make a compelling story. So one night, I just sat down and wrote the piece—nobody asked me to, I just did it—and sent it to our managing partner.\n\nHe was impressed. We polished it up together and pitched it to the global magazine editor. They didn't just accept it—they made it the cover story.\n\nThat one evening of writing on my own initiative completely changed my career path. The article got noticed by senior leadership, and suddenly I was being offered a brand-new role heading up our communications department. Something I wrote because I felt like it ended up becoming my actual job.\n\nThat's what happens when you take initiative instead of waiting for things to come to you. I made that opportunity happen.\n\nThe faster you take ownership of your life, the faster things start moving in your favor. Sure, you'll get help along the way—lots of it. But that help shows up after you've already started moving, never before.\n\nPeople gravitate toward those who act. Who don't sit around asking for permission. The more you step up and make things happen, the more support you'll find. But it has to start with you.\n\nNo more assignments and assessments. No more office hours. No more grades. Nobody's checking in on you anymore. That's either terrifying or exciting—your choice.\n\nYour career, your relationships, your impact—they're all waiting for you to step up and claim them. The only question is: what are you going to build first?\n\n\n\n➡️What’s a time when you took initiative that changed the course of your career—or your life?

It’s how people understand who you are—not just what you’ve done.\n\nYour story isn’t just a list of accomplishments. It’s the narrative thread that connects your choices, experiences, values, and ambitions. It explains why you do what you do. Why you’ve taken certain risks. What you’ve learned, and what you’re striving for next.\n\nIf you’re graduating this year, you’re probably focused on applications, interviews, or introductions. You might be tempted to rattle off your GPA, internships, or club titles. But to paraphrase the late poet Maya Angelou: most people won’t remember your stats. They’ll remember how you made them feel. \n\nThey’ll remember the moment they saw your spark. That comes from a story, not a LinkedIn profile or a resume.\n\nWhen I was applying to Wharton, I landed an in-person interview in Taipei with the associate director of admissions, who had flown all the way from Philadelphia to meet applicants. I remember telling him how much I loved reading stories about business and the people who founded them and led them—whether in the pages of the Wall Street Journal or BusinessWeek. \n\n(This was during the very early days of the internet, so all of my information about the business world came from print.) \n\nI lit up when I talked about why these stories fascinated me. How do I know this? I remember the associate director nodding his head and taking copious notes. He must have sensed my energy. \n\nI’m convinced that conversation—where he saw my genuine enthusiasm and heard what drew me to the world of business—played a pivotal role in my acceptance. It wasn’t just about my academic record or GMAT or even my personal essay. It was about making a human connection through a story that mattered to me.\n\nThe good news? Everyone has a story. But not everyone takes the time to shape it and rehearse telling it. \n\nSo reflect. What experiences changed how you see the world? What personal values have guided you—even when it was hard? What’s a moment that tested you? What’s a win you’re proud of—not because it looks impressive, but because it meant something to you? What’s your “why”?\n\nThen practice telling it. Not like a script, but as a conversation. Make it human. Real. Honest. You don’t need to pretend you have it all figured out. You just need to show that you care enough to make sense of where you’ve been—and where you're going next.\n\nBecause people don’t invest in perfect profiles. They invest in people they understand and relate to. And stories are how we do just that.\n\n\n\n➡️What’s a time when you told your story and it resonated with someone in such a way that it changed the course of your career—or your life?

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1w ago": "You’ve spent four years—or more—working toward a degree. Maybe you chose it out of passion. Perhaps out of pressure. Or maybe just because it seemed practical. But here’s what no one tells you at graduation: your major is a starting point, not a destination.\n\nYour degree is an entry ticket, a key. It may open your first door, but it won’t decide the path you walk through it.\n\nWhat defines you is not your major. It’s your mindset. Your ability to learn, adapt, communicate, and solve problems will matter more than the courses you took.\n\nWhen I was in college, I majored in Asian Studies, and eventually earned a master’s degree in it. At the time, I assumed I’d head to law school. Business school wasn’t on my radar. And management consulting? I didn’t even know the industry existed.\n\nAfter graduation, I spent three years working in advertising at a multinational ad agency in Taiwan. It was fast-paced, creative, and gave me my first taste of working in a multinational corporate environment. \n\nEventually, after deciding against applying to law school, I returned to the U.S. to pursue an MBA—and that’s what led me to a completely new path: management consulting.\n\nI wasn’t alone in pivoting. One of my college roommates majored in comparative literature but fell in love with sculpting. He eventually returned to school for an art degree. Today, he runs a respected art dealership in New York. Another roommate, also an Asian Studies major, went on to lead the Asia real estate division of a major multinational financial institution.\n\nNone of us ended up doing what we expected to while at school. But all of us ended up doing something that we eventually grew into. \n\nI sometimes stumbled into career opportunities that opened up for me, partly as a result of my own efforts, and partly out of sheer timing and luck. \n\nCareers today are rarely linear. You will likely have multiple chapters, and the most fulfilling ones may have little to do with what you studied.\n\nInstead of asking, “What did I major in?” ask, “What am I curious about now?” “What can I learn at the company I’m considering joining or the one I’m at now?” \n\nFollow that thread. Learn new skills. Invest in yourself. Take risks. Speak up for yourself. And be prepared to pivot when you feel you’re not on the path you want to be on, when you need to change course. \n\nYou are not your major. You are what you build from here.\n\n\n\n➡️What experience have you had pivoting into a career unrelated to your college or grad school major? Share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n🔔And follow or connect with me for more advice for recent graduates.",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1w ago": "Most jobs aren’t posted. Most opportunities don’t come from cold emails or polished resumes. They come from conversations, connections, and people who think of you when a door opens. \n\nThat’s why I say: network like your life depends on it—because in a way, it does.\n\nNetworking isn’t about handing out business cards or collecting LinkedIn connections. It’s about planting seeds. Reaching out. Showing up. Asking questions. Listening more than you talk. Following up without expecting anything in return.\n\nAs a fresh graduate, you might think you have nothing to offer. But you do: curiosity, energy, and a willingness to learn. That’s more valuable than you know. People want to help—but they need to know who you are and what you care about.\n\nStart with people you already know. Family friends. Teachers. Coaches. Past bosses. Don’t ask for a job right away though—ask for 15 minutes of their time to learn from their journey. Then keep in touch. Send a thank-you note. Share a thoughtful article. Let them know how things are going.\n\nThe point is to build genuine relationships over time. Careers aren’t ladders anymore—they’re webs. Every connection is a thread.\n\nYears ago, I experienced this in the most literal way. I was having chest pain and had seen a couple of doctors with no clear diagnosis. I casually mentioned it to a good friend, a highly successful business owner I had gotten to know through my recent networking efforts, and he immediately connected me with one of Taiwan’s top cardiologists—someone he knew personally. \n\nThat introduction fast-tracked my scan, which revealed major artery blockage. Within days, I was in the operating room for a brief but critical procedure. That connection, which started out as a simple “thank you” email from me to my friend, literally saved my life.\n\nWe often think networking is about our careers. But it’s about something deeper: being part of a community that you’ve nurtured over time, so that when you need help—professionally or personally—you’re not starting from zero.\n\nSo make the call. Send the message. Go to the event. Ask the question. Follow up.\n\nNetwork like your life depends on it.\n\nBecause sometimes, it truly does.\n\n\n\n➡️What advice do you have for networking effectively?

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3mo ago": "Back in the mid-1990s, while working at a global ad agency (my first “real” job), I was on a team developing a TV and print campaign for our client’s new overnight package delivery service. \n\nThe challenge: visually communicate speed in a creative and memorable way (all within the typical 30 second time limit of a TV commercial).\n\nDuring a brainstorming session, I threw out an idea—what if we showed a man rapidly carving an ice sculpture? The inspiration came from elaborate banquets I had attended in Taiwan, where ice sculptures were a centerpiece. It felt fresh, unexpected, and visually striking.\n\nA few weeks later, the creative director presented his storyboards, and there it was: a man carving a giant ice sculpture with a chainsaw. He even gave the character my Chinese name at the time, Wang Taiping—a name I later changed after learning it was hilariously outdated. \n\nThe team loved it. The client loved it. And the creative director basked in the glow of the client’s approval—while failing to acknowledge my contribution to the concept. \n\nThe client was so invested in the idea they even hired Jackie Chan, the popular actor who famously does his own stunts, to play the part of the sculptor. \n\nSoon, I found myself in an industrial section of Hong Kong, watching the production crew bring my idea to life.\n\nLessons Learned:\n\n✅ Good ideas don’t require a lot of “experience”. What seemed like a throwaway idea in a free-thinking session turned into the winning concept. Never hold back an idea just because it feels unconventional—or because you think you’re too young. I was just 25 at the time.\n\n✅ Creativity often originates from personal experience. Observing something as simple as banquet ice sculptures in Taiwan led to an idea that shaped a regional ad campaign. Inspiration is everywhere—pay attention and take lots of notes.\n\n✅ Great ideas don’t just stay on paper. The best ones can make it all the way to production, proving that creativity, when combined with execution, can be transformed into reality. \n\nBut there’s one more lesson that stuck with me.\n\nSure, it bothered me when our creative director took my idea as his.  \n\nBut from that early career experience, I learned a valuable lesson that guided me as I later moved into decision-making and management roles. \n\nWhen a colleague develops an idea or proposes a plan that has a positive impact, be sure to publicly—and privately—recognize their contributions—no matter their age. They could be junior, or they could be older and more experienced. \n\nIt’s not just the right thing to do—it builds better teams, stronger ideas, and lasting respect.\n\n❓Have you ever had someone take credit for your idea at work? How did you handle it? I’d love to read about it in the comments. \n\n…\n\n(The opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.)\n\nImage: DALL-E\n\n#leadershiplessons #inspiringstories",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1yr ago": "I just got back from a trip to Shanghai where we held our annual “China Week” conference for clients.  \n\nHaving lived in Shanghai with my wife and two young kids for five years back in 2006-2011, returning to this remarkable city felt like coming back home. \n\nShanghai is Shanghai. It’s both representative of the rest of the “new China” but also an outlier of sorts. Unique, with its cosmopolitan flair and long history as a commercial headquarters for foreign companies and a place that was carved up and claimed by foreign powers from the West and Asia alike. \n\nShanghai is an enormously fun city. My family and I had a lot of good times when we lived there and made some great friends. \n\nWhile the pandemic has not been forgotten, of course, it does feel very much like the city has returned to normal. \n\nImmigration lines at the airport are one of the first indicators I look at as a gauge of the economic temperature. They were very long this time, much longer than a year ago, and certainly longer than January 2020, when the pandemic was taking hold in the country and travel was quickly cut off. \n\nA recent report by my colleague Daniel Zipser shows that domestic travel has bounced back and now exceeds pre-COVID levels. International travel is rising month by month and is rapidly approaching pre-pandemic levels. A recent survey by my firm shows international travel as the top item that Chinese consumers plan to increase their spending on in the next few months. \n\nOn the roads you can’t help but see electric vehicles everywhere. While local brands like BYD, XPeng, and NIO are common, there are lots of Teslas as well. In fact, as recent data from my colleague’s report shows, local brands have captured 84.5% of the EV market, which grew by a whopping 37% in 2023. Tesla has managed to carve out an impressive 7.8% share. EVs now make up 35.6% of China’s overall market of 21.7 million cars. \n\nThe pandemic, economic uncertainty, lagging consumer confidence, and a collapsed property market have led Chinese consumers to sock away a lot more of their cash over the last few years, pushing the savings rate to 31.7%, well above the 4% that American consumers save. \n\nThe 56 trillion in additional renminbi they’ve stored away in their bank accounts between 2020 and 2023, if unleashed, could have an enormous impact on domestic consumption as well as overseas spending by Chinese travelers. \n\nIn fact, the early travelers who are heading to Japan, Singapore, Paris, and Milan have already been spending ferociously, with per traveler spending up by the double digits in these destinations.\n\nChina has its challenges. But it’s also continuing to do what it’s been focusing on for the past few decades: Innovating, investing, manufacturing, and spending. \n\nAnd they’re doing it all at their typical “China speed”, which is something to marvel at. \n\n(There’s a link to the full report in the comments)\n\n#china #shanghai #economy",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 1yr ago": "Today, I had just finished directing a French colleague, a McKinsey partner and deep expert in digital transformations, for a video we’re producing on the topic, when I overheard the hotel manager outside of the room where we were filming bark an order for “more macarons on the 5th floor!”\n\nI couldn’t help but mention the irony of the moment to my colleague, especially as it was the only non-Chinese word the manager spoke in a string of Mandarin, in a city on the other side of the world (Shanghai), and in a location of the city not too far from what was once known as the “French Concession,” a section of Shanghai that was administered by the French from 1849-1943. With its leafy streets and European-style architecture, it’s known as the “Paris of the East.”\n\n“Macaron!” My colleague lit up instantly and invited me to look at his camera roll on his phone. \n\nHe opened a photo of boxes of multi-colored macarons and proudly declared he made them himself. \n\nHe continued to swipe through several more photos of his incredible confectionary creations.\n\n“Did you attend culinary school?” I asked in awe. \n\n“No, I just enjoy making these on the weekend for my family. My three kids love to eat desserts. I spend hours making these every weekend. I enjoy it.”\n\n“Seriously, you could easily open a shop that rivals any of the best patisserie’s in the city…like Paul (the French pastry chain)!”, thinking he would feel flattered.\n\nHe rolled his eyes. “I have high standards.”\n\nHere is a guy who spends long hours and several days away from home each month advising some of the world’s biggest companies on their most complicated operational issues. \n\nYet he still manages to find the time (and energy!) to bake pastries for his young family on the weekend. \n\nPastries that look like a lemon on the outside, but when sliced in half reveals that it’s a cake instead, with fruit, jellies, and other delicacies inside. \n\nApple tarts with dozens of thin apple slices arrayed with geometric symmetry.\n\nCream puffs that ooze liquid caramel from the center. \n\nSure, most of us have hobbies. He’s not the only one. I’m sure you do too. \n\nWhat surprised me most was not that—jaw-droppingly impressive as his talent is.\n\nWhat surprised me is the assumption I had made about him. \n\nHow I had judged him prior to knowing about his pastry making skills. \n\nI had never met him before, so of course I wouldn’t know. \n\nI based my understanding of him on what little I did know about him—that he is one of our firm’s experts on complex digital transformations. \n\nBut I knew nothing else about him. \n\nThe take-away for me?\n\nTemper your judgments and assumptions about other people.\n\nTry to find more opportunities to ask about what people are interested in. \n\nWhat they’re passionate about. \n\nWhat they spend hours on the weekend doing for the sake of their family, or just for themselves. \n\nWhat lights them up. \n\nAnd remind myself what makes me feel the same way—and devote more time to doing that. \n\n#inspiration",

He’s also the founder of TechMoat Consulting, a boutique digital advisory firm. \n\nI’ve known Jeff for the past decade, since we first collaborated on one of his bestselling books. \n\nHe’s incredibly insightful about all things digital, enormously knowledgeable about China, he’s a deep thinker and captivating speaker, and I always learn something from him. \n\nI’ll be sharing my entire conversation with Jeff on LinkedIn and my Substack later this weekend but wanted to first share this excerpt from our illuminating conversation.

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "LinkedIn is rolling out a new AI-powered feature that will automate the content writing process. Some of the most regular content creators are concerned that this will lead to an explosion of generic, bot-like content.\n\nI agree the threat of this occurring is very real, and it is somewhat concerning and, frankly, a bit depressing. \n\nBut let's face it: content creators here are already using ChatGPT and other tools to help them generate content, whether you notice it or not. AI-generated, or AI-facilitated, content creation on LinkedIn is not going away.\n\nSo what should we do? How can we retain the human element in the creative process? Will we--we humans that is--continue to even matter?\n\nI think so, and my friend Amy Blaschka would agree. \n\nBack in July 2021, when I interviewed her for my podcast, Write With Impact, well before ChatGPT turned the world upside down, she had some insightful observations about the need to retain your humanity when writing on LinkedIn.\n\n(I've transcribed her comments in case you don't have time to watch the clip, but I'd encourage you to watch it if you do).\n\n❓ What do you think? I would love to read your thoughts in the comments to this post. Let's discuss and debate!\n\n- - - - - -\n\n\"I think there is this misperception that on social media, you have to just share all the wins and you have to have what I call the 'Instagram worthy, curated content.' \n\nIt’s like there’s only the good stuff, because God forbid you share anything that would portray you as someone who's made a mistake or had a supposed failure.\n\nBut the opposite is true. People respond to humans, to imperfect people. And when you're a leader, of course you've made mistakes. Everybody has stumbled. \n\nBut the important thing is, when you're sharing about that, is to say, you know, this happened, but this is how I found my way out.\n\nAnd something like that will endear you to other people; they'll also come to see you as human. \n\nYou leave them with something that they connect better with, because you're not somebody that's up on a pedestal imparting your wisdom.\n\nThat genuineness really translates well across social media, because we both know there are a lot of people that do the opposite. \n\nAnd sorry, you're going to alienate people, or they're going to keep scrolling. \n\nI would personally much rather read and share something that is real world, real life.\"\n\n\n- - - - - - - -\nYou should follow Amy, subscribe to her LinkedIn newsletter, Momentum, and subscribe to her Substack, Illuminate Me (links in the comments).\n\nAnd please reach out and connect with me for more writing tips and in-depth conversations with award-winning writers and content creators!\n\n#generativeai #contentcreator #humanconnection",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "You know how you can sense when a piece of writing flows smoothly from one sentence to the next? How do writers do this?\n\nAccording to one definition, \"writing flow refers to the pace, cadence, or rhythm of a piece of writing. Good writing flow allows a reader to ease into the text without expending much mental energy—it has a natural feel that makes reading a breeze. Texts without good flow feel choppy and lack cohesion.\" (Masterclass)\n\nSmoother, more rhythmic writing...\n\n...creates an enjoyable reading experience.\n\n...engages the reader and holds their attention.\n\n...communicates ideas more clearly and with more impact.\n\n...projects professionalism and builds credibility.\n\nIn this quick guide, I've assembled 6 tips (with brief examples and a few quotes from famous authors sprinkled in for inspiration) to help you improve the sense of flow in your writing.\n\nHere they are:\n\nTip 1️⃣ : Vary Sentence Structure\nCombine simple, compound, and complex sentences to create a more dynamic and engaging rhythm that holds your reader’s attention.\n\nTip 2️⃣ : Play with Sentence Length\nAlternate between short sentences to create tension or add emphasis, and longer sentences to provide detail and nuance.\n\nTip 3️⃣ : Use Transitions Wisely\nConnect your ideas seamlessly with transition words and phrases. They're the essential link between sentences and paragraphs, and guide your reader through your narrative.\n\nTip 4️⃣ : Embrace Active Voice\nReplace passive constructions with active ones to inject energy and forward momentum into your prose.\n\nTip 5️⃣ : Be Mindful of Parallelism\nWhen writing lists or comparing items, ensure that the grammatical structure is consistent. This creates a sense of harmony and cohesion in your writing.\n\nTip 6️⃣ : Read Aloud\nSometimes, the best way to identify problems with flow is to read your writing aloud. This helps you spot awkward phrasing, repetition, or other inconsistencies that may affect its rhythm and flow.\n\n\n❓ How do you improve the sense of flow in your writing?

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "After a 60-year career, this bestselling author of more than 25 novels still finds this part of the writing process “pure torture.”\n\nThese are the words Judy Blume, author of pre-teen classics such as “Are You There God, It’s Me Margaret?”, “Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,” and “Forever”, uses to describe how she feels about writing the first draft:\n\n“My process is a strange one, and the way that I explain it to kids — maybe it’s not so strange, maybe I just think it’s strange — the first draft for me is pure torture. There’s no question about that.\n\nI had so much inside me, I had so much creative energy, and I needed to let it out so badly, so the first few books just poured out. But that was then. \n\nAnd for many, many, many, many years now, I have found first drafts to be torture. Getting something out. \n\nOnce I have a first draft out, then I like it. I like the rewriting. I’m a reviser, more than a first draft writer…And I go through at least five drafts.”\n\n\nI’m not a writer or editor of fiction, but I find Blume’s honest confession (note how she says “pure torture” so emphatically, and twice, in this video clip) very encouraging and affirming of my own anxiety around producing the first draft of whatever I’m working on.\n\nAs a pre-teen boy, I was a huge fan of Blume’s searingly honest, funny, and highly relatable books — including the ones she wrote for pre-teen girls — and I’ve enjoyed watching my own kids get hooked on her books. \n\nOne of her most popular books, “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” was released as a major movie production last week, and a new documentary about her life and work is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe 85-year-young Blume, who now lives in Key West, where she runs a non-profit book store that has a special section for banned books, has been giving a number of interviews recently, including an excellent conversation with Terry Gross of NPR, which I recommend you check out (link in the comments).\n\n❓How do you feel about writing the first draft? (If you’re a Judy Blume fan, what was your favorite book?) \n\nShare your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#writing #inspiration \n\nVideo source: AdLit, an education service of WETA, the flagship public broadcasting station in Washington DC. adlit.org",

This was Bill Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nAs Jobs explains in this rare video clip, Bill laughed, and then not only gave him the spare parts he asked for, he gave him a summer internship at the Hewlett-Packard factory on the very assembly line that built them. \n\nThe lesson Jobs took away from that formative experience: if you want to get ahead in life or at work, you need to learn to ask for what you want. \n\n“Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask, and that’s what separates sometimes the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. \n\nYou’ve gotta act, and you’ve gotta be willing to fail, you’ve gotta be willing to crash and burn, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. \n\nIf you’re afraid of failing you won’t get very far.”\n\nSince I first discovered this rare interview with Steve Jobs, I’ve been profoundly impressed by the message he shares. \n\nIt’s a message I’ve tried to instill in my own children as they navigate school and the working world, and it’s a message I sometimes remind myself of. \n\n❔ What do you think? How does Jobs’ message resonate with you? Share your thoughts in the comments. \n\n#stevejobs #inspiration #successmindset",

It's not. It's all perspiration, you know, and judgment.\n\nAnd you're never satisfied with what you do. About every page you write is perhaps thrown away three or four times.\n\nThere's a place outside my little work hut where that white brick wall is blackened, where the bonfire takes place about every week. I have a wastepaper basket beside me which is three to four-foot high and that gets filled.\n\nThere's a tremendous lot of work involved at the desk, working it out, seeing which way to go, writing the first page, and rewriting it about ten times.\n\nAnd while you're rewriting that first page, the rest of it is subconsciously beginning to build in your mind bit by bit.”\n\n#ai #writing #censorship",

(Link to my article in the comments)\n\nI had just opened my NY Times app this evening in Taipei to catch up on the news when I saw the live stream of NASA’s event to announce the four astronauts on Artemis II, the next mission to circle the moon scheduled for late 2024. \n\nWhen I heard NASA administrator Bill Nelson announce Reid as the Commander of the mission, I was overwhelmed with surprise and excitement and immediately congratulated him through an email to his brother. \n\nReid was chief astronaut at NASA, a position he deliberately stepped down from so he could be eligible to lead this mission, rather than just assign other astronauts to it. \n\nIn this time of uncertainty and conflict in the world, it’s inspiring to see that we are continuing the mission that President John F. Kennedy announced in his historic speech more than 60 years ago that set the US on a path toward the moon and space travel. \n\nCongratulations to Commander Wiseman and the entire crew of Artemis II !\n\n#spacenews #spaceexploration #moonshot",

Jane is the Director of the Writing Center at Harvard University, where she’s been teaching undergraduate and graduate students how to become better writers for nearly 23 years.\n\nWhen ChatGPT was first released to the public in December, she shared her initial impressions on Writing Hacks, her Substack newsletter, published opeds in the Boston Globe, and was interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning. So, to help me parse through this phenomenon, I invited Jane for a conversation about ChatGPT on my podcast, Write With Impact. \n\nAs an educator, Jane is concerned about the impact this technology will have on students’ ability—and patience—to work through the process of learning how to write, a process she sees as critical to their ability to discover and articulate their own ideas on the subjects they are learning. \n\nAfter exploring the impact of ChatGPT on the process of learning how to write, Jane shares a few practical writing tips drawing on her two decades of experience teaching thousands of students at Harvard, as well as her work coaching corporate clients.\n\nShe talks about cutting repetitive language, removing words that dilute the impact of your message, applying the 80-20 rule to using the passive voice, and eliminating what she calls “fake transitions”.\n\n❓ How do you think ChatGPT will change the way we write--and learn to write?

They have your back during tough times.\nExceptional leaders are the ones who stand up for you and support you during your most challenging moments.\n\n6.

She's also published opeds in the Boston Globe on the topic, and she's explored the topic on her Substack, \"Writing Hacks.\"\n\nI sat down with Jane for the latest episode of Write With Impact to get her take on how ChatGPT and generative AI might impact the way we write--and how we learn to write.\n\nHere's an 8-minute excerpt from my one-hour conversation that I'll be sharing on my Write With Impact newsletter on LinkedIn this week. (Be sure to hit the 'subscribe' button to get the full episode once I release it.  Visit my profile or click the link in the comments.)\n\nHere's Jane:\n\n\"A useful way that I’ve found to explain my concern about this, and to think about my concern, is the difference between process and product. \nChatGPT creates a written product. You say to it, \"write me a college paper,\" “write me some real estate listings,” whatever it is that you’re doing in your field, and out it comes. It’s a complete product. \n\nSo that's one way of thinking about it. This machine can do our writing for us.\n\nBut when you teach writing, you're not really in search of a product, you're in search of a thought process. For my students, I’m much less interested in what the product is--we can get a product from anywhere. \n\nWhat I’m interested in is, what are they interested in, what kinds of questions do they have, and how does the process of writing an answer to a question help you figure out what you think. And that's not what ChatGPT is designed to do. It's a product.\n\nI think for educators, the concern—and it’s a very reasonable and real concern—is if what we're really trying to do is teach critical thinking, and help our students become people who understand the world, know what they think, know what they want to ask questions about, it's hard to imagine that this chatbot is the way to achieve that goal. \n\nAnd yet it’s there, and it’s easily accessible, and people are using it, so now we have to figure out how we co-exist with this technology.\"\n\n(Watch the clip for more...and be sure to subscribe my Write With Impact newsletter on LinkedIn for the full one-hour conversation.)\n\n#chatgpt #generativeai #writing",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "There are a lot of people on LinkedIn recommending tools and apps to make you a better writer.\n\nI'm sure some of these are helpful, but there is one writing tool that everyone already has, doesn't require a free or paid subscription, and doesn't have to be downloaded.\n\nI'm referring to your ears.\n\nI can't over-emphasize how powerful this tool is, and how much I rely on it for my own writing.\n\nRead your writing back to yourself silently, or out loud if you can (I prefer to read silently). \n\nIf it doesn't sound right, then re-arrange the words, choose different ones, change the punctuation, or move the sentence somewhere else.\n\nSnip it if it's just not working.\n\nAnother tip: when you're reading other people's writing, slow down and listen to how it sounds in your head (or out loud if you prefer). \n\nI often do this when I read. While it slows down my reading pace, I do it  as a deliberate exercise in absorbing and analyzing the writing styles of writers I admire.\n\nI was going to make a nicely colored carousel on LinkedIn to make this point, but I don't think you need that (and I'd rather spend the time writing).\n\nThanks for reading (and listening).\n\nQuestion: How do you use your most powerful writing app--your ears--to improve your writing?

He had already been at the firm for five years and was transferring from another location. I was a fresh MBA grad incredibly excited about joining my dream firm. \n\nSince then, we’ve worked together on a range of initiatives: on client projects during my days as an associate, on crafting a new strategy for the Taipei office that has had enduring impact to this day, on publishing reports and articles in major media that have built our brand and attracted new clients. \n\nBut beyond work, Martin has had an even more profound impact on my career and my life. \n\nHe was instrumental in helping me make the transition from consulting to communications back in 1999, at a time when we didn’t really have anyone covering this function on a full time basis. I was the first, or one of the first, full time external communications specialists globally at McKinsey. \n\nMartin was there several years ago when I was going through a rough patch at work. He listened, he offered advice, and he stepped up and reached out on my behalf to senior colleagues about my situation. \n\nMartin was there when a close family member was seriously ill and I needed someone to lean on for advice and support. He made the time to meet with me outside of the office, to listen to my problems, and offer some potential solutions for consideration. \n\nBesides having the sharpest mind of any McKinsey partner I’ve known, he also happens to have the biggest heart. \n\nEvery year for the past two decades, Martin has—without fail—sent me a happy birthday email. He’s the only person to remember my birthday consistently every year outside of my immediate family members. \n\nAfter an extraordinary 30-year career at McKinsey, Martin retired last September.  His list of accomplishments is long indeed. He led the firm’s global strategy and corporate finance practice for the past 8 years, advising clients around the world on their toughest strategic issues and opportunities, and leading hundreds of super-smart strategic thinkers.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote and published a groundbreaking and bestselling book about strategy. \n\nAnd last year, he was awarded McKinsey’s highest prize for knowledge innovation: the Gluck Award. Sort of our Nobel for Knowledge. \n\nMartin, thank you for all that you’ve done for me, for our Taipei office, for our Greater China practice, for the firm. \n\nBest wishes on the next chapter in your career! \n\n#mentorship #mckinsey #sponsorship",

Percent.\n\nThe rest of the universe consists of dark matter (around 25%) and dark energy (around 70%). Both of these are invisible, and astrophysicists to this day can't seem to agree on what they are exactly. \n\nSo how is this relevant to creating and sharing content on LinkedIn?\n\nWhen I write an article or post on LinkedIn, I often get a number of reactions and comments from members.\n\nLike any other creator, I enjoy seeing my content resonate with people. It makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I invested my time well.\n\nI usually get a handful of thoughtful, insightful comments that I learn from and that challenge my thinking.\n\nThese reactions and comments attract even more people to my content, many of whom share it with their networks, further expanding my reach and impact.\n\nWhat I've discovered after 9 years (!) of creating content on LinkedIn is this: there's a huge, huge, HUGE swathe of people out there who are reading my articles and posts, but who *never* share a reaction or comment.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nI've met several people in person who have told me they've been following my content for years and like it--even though they have never reacted or commented on it, nor reached out about it via private message or email.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nKnow that when you create and then share content--when you share a piece of yourself--on LinkedIn (or any other platform)--many more people are reading and watching and paying attention to you than you'll ever know.\n\nEven if they never react publicly and visibly through a \"like\" or a comment, know that you ARE having an impact on them.\n\nAnd that in itself is another valuable benefit, another reward, for the time and effort you put into creating and sharing content on LinkedIn.\n\nThat makes it even more worth it.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you agree? What's your experience with the \"silent readers\" out there?

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "I was honored to deliver a guest lecture at National Taiwan University recently.🎓🏫\n\nIt was highly energizing to be on a college campus and in a lecture hall again. It felt surreal to be at the podium being the one to share my knowledge. For a kid from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it’s been quite a journey. \n\nI was highly impressed by the smart questions the students threw at me after my talk, and even more impressed by the student who published a LinkedIn blog post (in English, even though it’s his second or third language) the next day summarizing some of my key messages. \n\nI enjoyed my college and grad school experience and would do it all over again if given the chance. \n\nWhich prompts me to share some quick advice for current and future college students: \n\n\n📚Discover and pursue the subjects that drive your curiosity and fuel your motivation \n\nWhile the temptation to major in subjects that will put you on a path toward a job is understandable given the enormous cost of college and the need to get off to a good start in the working world, don’t let those dominate your course choices. \n\nBalance the practical, career-oriented subjects with ones that you’re genuinely interested in. You’ll derive more enjoyment from the learning process, will be more likely to retain what you study for a longer time, and will probably get better grades. \n\n\n🙋‍♀️ Be present and participate \n\nI skipped or slept through or doodled my way through my share of classes—especially economics and biology. I was not fond of those classes. Late nights studying or socializing can make it tough to sit through long lectures or seminars at 8:30 am. But do your best nonetheless to show up on time, avoid skipping class, and offer your opinion or ask a question during class. You’ll get a lot more out of your experience. Your parents will never know of course how much you showed up or participated, but this is about you and your future, not them. \n\n\n🐟🐠🐡Cast a wide net when socializing and networking \n\nI met so many interesting people in college and grad school and had some amazing times. I even met my future wife. But I still can’t help but harbor some regret over not meeting even more people. Time is limited and there’s only so much you can do in your waking hours, but I would still suggest broadening your social circles and participating in clubs and events that connect you with people you wouldn’t otherwise meet in class or your dormitory. \n\n\n☎️ Don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it\n\nThe invisible yet tangible pressure coming from society, from parents, from peers, and from the institution you’re attending can be overwhelming. High school pretends to prepare you for this experience but they don’t really. If you’re struggling, if you’re not feeling well, reach out for help. Whether it’s a friend, family member, or professional who you can talk to. Prioritize your mental health. \n\n#collegelife #universitylife #mentalhealth",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 2yr ago": "I’m not a champagne drinker, but this is a special bottle that I’ll remember receiving for many years to come.🍾🥂\n\nThe managing partner of our office in Taipei gave this to me to celebrate my promotion at McKinsey. \n\nI’ve often been asked, and I’ve often pondered, why I’ve been here for so long. What keeps me motivated? Where do I get my energy? Am I still learning anything new? Am I still growing professionally? \n\nThese are questions I’ve pondered mostly privately of course, but also at times very publicly through my writing here on LinkedIn over the years. \n\nI write about my experiences and lessons learned along the way both to share what I’ve gone through with the hope of helping others—but also as my way of processing my experiences, of gleaning lessons from them.\n\nI am generally reluctant to toot the horn of my employer in my writing here because I fear it will sound promotional. Ironic for someone whose job it is to actually market the services of the firm that I work for. \n\nAnyway, here are a few things that come to mind from my 25 1/2-year journey at McKinsey & Company:\n\n\n✔️Extraordinary people\n\nI’ve worked with some of the smartest people I’ve ever known. I feel privileged to learn from them. I also feel privileged to have the chance to share my own skills and knowledge with them. To contribute to their success. But what really amazes me is the kindness, the graciousness, the care and concern for others, that characterizes the people I get to work with. \n\n\n✔️Opportunities to learn and grow\n\nI don’t care how senior or experienced I get, I can’t imagine not wanting to learn something new or try something different. I can’t imagine, in other words, not wanting to grow or change as a professional or as a person. \n\nMcKinsey has given me an abundance of resources and opportunities to learn new things, experiment with new approaches and formats (like being one of the first in our firm to launch a podcast back in 2011 when few people here listened or even knew what a podcast was) and just try things out without continuously obsessing with performance metrics like page views or video plays or podcast downloads or media hits or whatever. \n\n\n✔️Feedback-rich environment \n\nWe are an intense, impact-focused firm. What fuels this remarkable engine is many things, one of which is a constant flow of feedback. It’s this feedback that tells me what I’m doing is having a positive impact and therefore I should keep doing it or figure out a way to do more of it. It’s this feedback that also tells me when I’ve done something that hasn’t landed well. \n\n\n✔️Room to recharge\n\nThe past three years since the pandemic flipped the world upside down have been particularly challenging for me on the health front. I’m grateful for the time I’ve had to recover and recharge after these situations.\n\n\nThank you to the many people who have supported me throughout my journey. Above all, thank you to my wife and family. \n\n\n#gratitude #professionaldevelopment #personalgrowth",

By 2025, another 71 million households could enter this high-income bracket.\n\nTrend #2: Premiumization maintains momentum\n\nDespite rising anxiety over the economy and their personal incomes, when they do spend, consumers still trade up to more premium brands when they’re looking to reward themselves. \n\nThe strong growth of upper-middle and high-income households and the spending power they bring to bear has proved to be a boon for high-quality and premium brands: 26 percent of these wealthier respondents said they spent more in 2022 compared with the previous year. Only 14 percent of these consumers said they had cut their spending in 2022.\n\nTrend #3: Smarter choices, but not trading down\n\nChinese consumers are tightening their belts: In 2022, the proportion of respondents who said they or their family increased spending by 5 percent or more versus the previous year fell by half from 32 percent in 2019 to 16 percent, while 22 percent said they had decreased their spending.\n\nAs a result, consumers are not trading down, but they are getting much smarter about what they buy and where.\n\nTrend #4: It’s all about the product\n\nIn 2022, functionality extended its lead as the most important factor influencing Chinese consumers of fast-moving consumer goods. Chinese consumers are deeply knowledgeable about the features and specifications of the products they buy, from the ingredients that go into their facial cream, to the type and quality of down feathers that make up their favorite jacket.\n\nTrend #5: Local companies are winning\n\nThe preference for local brands has accelerated in the past few years. And, contrary to what many think, national pride is not the only driving factor. Chinese brands today offer excellent products that are competitive or sometimes even superior to their foreign peers.\n\nClick here to download a free PDF of the full report:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gA4_iQMf\n\n#China #consumers #economy",

We are all trying to leap over our own hurdles, the ones that confront us each day at work and in life. \n\nWe are all trying to identify and solve a series of never-ending problems, some of which are small and easily resolvable, some that are very large and extraordinarily complicated. Some of our problems — our hurdles in life — seem to never be surmountable.\n\nAnd, just as we celebrate the resolution of one problem, another three crop up that we have to tackle. Yet we muster whatever energy we have to keep moving forward toward our goals.\n\nSo for my son, and for all other graduates like him this year who are marking this major milestone in your lives: \n\nTap deeply into those sources of energy that power you through the tough times; try to stay laser-focused on what lies ahead, without dwelling on the mistakes and regrets of the past; and keep looking out for — and jumping over — that seemingly endless series of hurdles that life inevitably throws at you.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2022!\n\n#inspiration #lifeandleadership #leadership #personaldevelopment \n#classof2022",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3yr ago": "What’s your source of energy?\n\nEarth is, on average, 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun. \n\nAll of life is dependent upon the energy we receive from the sun. \n\nSo far away, and yet so very near to all of us, and absolutely essential. \n\nWhat’s most mind boggling to me is that this energy travels through freezing cold space (minus 455 degrees fahrenheit, to be precise) at 186,000 miles per second (the speed of light), reaching us about 8 minutes and 20 seconds after departing the sun. \n\nThis invisible energy is then transformed into the energy that powers all of life here on earth. \n\nSolar energy powers the water cycle, and it drives wind formation. Solar energy powers photosynthesis in plants. Even the fossil fuels that power our homes and cars originally received their energy from the sun, albeit hundreds of millions or even billions of years ago.\n\nAmazingly, only a small portion of the energy radiated by the sun into space strikes the Earth, just one part in two billion. \n\nAn infinitesimally small amount relative to the sun’s total energy output, yet an absolutely enormous quantity of energy for those of us here on planet earth. The sun provides more energy in an hour than the United States can use in a year.\n\nI was contemplating these things as I looked out the window of my office in Taipei yesterday. I was mesmerized by the orange-red brilliance of the sun as it slowly dipped beneath the horizon, marking the transition from day to night.\n\nWatching the sun go down made me think about where I derive my own energy to do the things that I do, whether it’s at work, at home, or at the non-profit where I’ve been devoting my spare time.\n\nAt work, my energy has ebbed and flowed over the years, but I’ve learned to discover and sometimes rediscover the sources of energy that power my interest in what I do for a living. \n\nAt home, clearly the primary sources of energy are my family — my wife, my son, my daughter. I know they rely on me for their energy as well, but it’s absolutely a two-way exchange. We sustain each other.\n\nAnd in the non-profit realm, I draw energy from the knowledge that I’m devoting my time and skills to a cause that many people find deeply meaningful, including myself.\n\nWhere do you derive your energy? Please share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#inspiration #personaldevelopment  #energy",

(He's a senior at college getting ready to graduate).\n\nSince I couldn't be there to watch him, I of course asked him how he did, expecting he would tell me how he scored relative to his competitors: 1st? 2nd? 5th?\n\nInstead, he told me he got a \"personal best\" in the 200 meter dash. He beat his own record. \n\nHe also told me he ran a great first leg in the 4x400 meter relay.\n\n\"So many people cheering me on was nice.\"\n\nHe didn't tell me how he lined up against his competitors in any of his races, but it didn't seem to matter to him, nor to me. \n\nWhat mattered was that he ran as fast and as hard as he could, and he beat his own time.\n\nAt school, there are the metrics everyone obsesses over: GPA, class rank, what colleges you got accepted to. Students are constantly comparing themselves to each other.\n\nAt work, people are checking each other's title, scope of responsibility, number of direct reports, salary, and wondering where they are positioned in this race, and why they aren't where they believe they deserve to be.  \n\nComparison with others is inevitable. But isn't it more important to look at yourself, and compare your performance to your own? Isn't it more valuable to your own professional and personal growth to measure yourself against your own metrics?\n\nWhat are you doing to expand your knowledge and learn new skills? \n\nWhat are you doing today that will help you make that 1% improvement, that will help you step up from where you were last month or last year?\n\nHow do you maintain your focus on your own performance (while obsessing less about what the \"competition\" is doing)?\n\nPlease share your thoughts in the comments.\n\n#personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #inspiration \n\n(That's my son in the middle, #7)",

Grace, Founder and CEO of Publish Your Purpose, addressed in a recent Writing Masterclass for Write With Impact Academy.\n\nHere are a few clips from that conversation.\n\n#inspirationalmessage #writing #storytelling",

    "Glenn Leibowitz's post 3yr ago": "Most of the time, when we sit down to write, we write with the intention of using the words that we produce. Whether we’re writing an email, a school essay, a business proposal, or a blog post, we’ve got a very specific goal in mind: inform a colleague, impress a teacher, persuade a client, educate a reader.\n\nBut what if you wrote without any intention of ever showing your words to the world? What if you wrote simply as a meditative exercise that can help you clear your mind, process your emotions, and tap into your creative potential?\n\nThat’s precisely what Julia Cameron recommends. Cameron is a poet, screenwriter, creativity coach, and author of 40 books, including \"The Miracle of Morning Pages: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Most Important Artist's Way Tool.\"\n\nIn her book, she introduces what she calls “morning pages”, a daily free-writing ritual that can help you sort through tough issues you might be tackling in your personal or professional life. “The morning pages are three pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness.”\n\nUnlike talk therapy, which can also be highly effective at address mental health issues, but which comes with a cost that may not always be completely covered by your insurance provider, morning pages is a simple and completely free exercise that requires no technology beyond a few sheets of paper and a pen or pencil. In fact, Cameron strongly advises against using a computer to write morning pages.\n\nIn addition to writing by hand, she also suggests:\n\nWrite as soon as you wake.\n\nCameron recommends writing morning pages as early as possible, soon after you wake-up, and after you’ve had your morning brew. “As a coffee lover myself, I wouldn’t want to get in the way of your favorite pick-me-up.”\n\nJust keep writing.\n\nWrite whatever comes to mind, however trivial it might seem. Just keep writing until you’ve filled three 8 1/2 x 11 inch pages, she advises. I try to fill three pages in a blue Moleskin notebook — not exactly the size of paper that Julia recommends. Use whatever size, thickness, or color of paper that feels right for you.\n\nDon’t write to publish.\n\nDon’t write with the expectation that you’ll use the material in a piece that you plan to publish. Write for yourself, and write without the inhibiting editorial voice in your head — the “Censor”, Cameron calls it — that tells you to cut this or that out of your writing.\n\nDon’t show your morning pages to anyone.\n\nCameron strongly advises to keep your morning pages entirely to yourself: “Nobody is allowed to read your morning pages except you. And you shouldn’t even read them yourself for the first eight weeks or so. Just write three pages…and write three more pages the next day.”\n\nHave you written morning pages, or practiced another similar journaling exercise?

After I got past the first draft, it was much better. The first draft took me two years, and I had a therapist during that time specifically for this purpose. \n\nEvery day I worked on the book it was painful, and I usually worked on it six days a week. It’s just like this wound that just starts to heal and you’re going to rip off the scab again. It was a very difficult time, it really was. And once I got the first draft done, I didn’t look at it for months, because I needed a breather from it. It was really really difficult. \n\nI work in my sister’s point of view. All of that writing, including going back and reading things that she had written in her journal—I didn’t read her journal until after she died—just that exercise in itself, spending a whole day reading her journal, was very emotional for me. She was a great writer.\"\n\nIf you have a bit of extra time this weekend, you might want to listen to the full podcast on Apple Podcasts, or watch the full video (just look for Write With Impact on YouTube).\n\n#writinglife #memoirs #cancerfighter",

Her bestselling book \"Better Off Bald: A Life in 147 Days\" is a medical memoir about raising her younger sister Adrienne from the age of eight until she died from liver cancer at the age of 15. \n\nAndrea led a Writing Masterclass which I'll be sharing on Write With Impact Academy soon. In her class she shares several strategies she used to write her memoir. One of these is \"Show, don't tell\" -->\n\n\"I think it’s really important that you show and don’t tell. So, don’t tell me that you’re angry, show me what does anger look like. How does it feel? \n\nAnd that’s how you really hook people in, if they’re going through the experience with you.\n\nSometimes writers try too hard to tell readers what to feel, much like movies when they put too much music in and they’re telling us with the music exactly what to feel at exactly the right time. \n\nYou have to trust your readers a bit more, and show them and trust them to infer whatever meaning that you’re trying to convey. And maybe they’ll get a different meaning out of it and that’s okay.\n\nThere’s a joke in my book that my sister made, and most people thought it was funny, a lot of people thought it was horrible. That’s okay.\n\nI showed, and didn’t tell. With memoir, you have to be honest.\"\n\n#writingtips #memoirs #cancerfighter",

(Link to the episode in the comments below 👇)\n\nAndrea was a journalist with CNN for 12 years, here in Greater China, where I'm based (she speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and spent her junior year studying Chinese intensively while living with a family in Taipei), and in other exciting places. She reported on some of the biggest stories of the day. \n\nHer father is Ted Koppel, the former long-time anchor of ABC News, an icon in the broadcast news world, and someone I admire immensely, having grown up watching his program nearly every night.\n\nAndrea did an impressive amount of research before we spoke. She asked me about some of the very personal things I wrote about myself in some of my recent LinkedIn articles. She dug deeper and teased out of me some of the pivotal decisions and moments in my career.\n\nThis was the first time I've ever articulated my career experience on a podcast, even though I've written about bits and pieces of what I've done, and what I do, in my articles here on LinkedIn.\n\nShe is, in a nutshell, an *awesome* interviewer and has fast become a friend here. She even called me a \"mensch\", which if you're familiar at all with Yiddish, is considered a high honor.\n\nI strongly encourage you to subscribe to her podcast not to listen to me, but to listen to the truly amazing guests she invites on her show. And definitely do follow Andrea here on LinkedIn where she posts her heartfelt and very honest insights into her own life and career experiences, and of course, that of her guests. \n\nHERE ARE SOME OF THE TOPICS I COVERED WITH ANDREA ON HER TIME4COFFEE PODCAST:\n\nHow speaking Mandarin Chinese fluently helped my early career (5:20)\n\nWhat my first “real” job was like at a multinational advertising agency in Taiwan (7:34)\n\nWhat I do at McKinsey day-to-day (9:54)\n\nHow one story that I wrote for an internal publication changed the trajectory of my career at McKinsey (14:15)\n\nWhat I mean when I talk about developing your “superpower” and how to discover yours (18:05)\n\nHow cultivating strong transferable skills helped my career (33:20)\n\nWhat are some of the benefits of working for a large, global firm (35:24)\n\nHow my failures positively affected my post-failure performance (46:13)\n\nAnd bonus \"TMI\" (Too Much Information): Why I wished that I had partied more in college (50:07) \n\n(Link to the episode on Time4Coffee in the comments below 👇)\n\n#podcast #careerchoices #careerdevelopment #careeradvice",

And that primed my brain to be open to ideas or ways of thinking about it, or analogies I could use, or stories I could tell.\n\nSo, by the time I actually sat down to write I had some ideas. In some cases I would jot them down on a note on my phone. And then when I would sit down I would flesh out what I was already thinking. That was a huge help, just doing that pre-thinking before I sat down to write.\"\n\n#writing #storytelling #books",

The beautiful thing about blogging and social media, when you write really rich content on social media, is by just doing it repetitively, the more you do it, the more comfortable you get with it. \n\nIt’s like learning to speak a language.  You just keep speaking it until you feel fluent. That’s how writing has become for me. I’m a very confident writer now but I was not 10 years ago.\n\nBeyond that I think the most important thing that you can do is just commit to writing. And sometimes it is easier to start on one of those platforms. \n\nIt’s like a stream, where you write something and it moves down and it moves on, because it feels like a little bit less of a commitment.\n\nBut the other thing you can do is if you decide, for example, to start a blog, or you decide to do vlogging, and let’s say you’re posting a video every week, you can just make a commitment to once a week posting a piece of content. \n\nAnd just know that 80% of it will be kind of mediocre, and 20% will be amazing and make your name on the internet.\n\nAnd that’s okay: the only way to get to that 20% that makes your name on the internet is to do the other 80% also, because it’s practice, your honing your voice, your honing your process, you’re getting better at the language that you’re learning to speak.\n\nAnd that’s the purpose of it. So, all of those people you know who want to write, they just need to start. Jeff Goins says that, 'You’re a writer, start writing.' \n\nThat’s how you become one, you just start doing it.\"\n\n#writing #content #publishing #contentmarketing",

I like making the bed. I like cooking. I like shopping for food. I enjoy tending to my plants. \n\nFor me, this is my meditation, this is what gives me a little meaning, a little sense of progress, cooking is foreplay for eating, taking stuff to the recycling is a little moment of accomplishment. Maybe I'm really sad. I equate moderate amounts of effort with pride, not inefficiency. \n\nThere are plenty of households where people work 4 jobs, where kids run riotously around, where cooking is survival and pressurized, where a 90 min commute via bus to a job is crippling. Where errands aren't fun, they are a burden.  But these robots are too expensive to be helping these households soon.\n\nThese robots will embellish the households where Instacart folk do the work, where errands are to be designed out of life. Where time and energy is to be saved, in the search for efficiency, but to do what with?\n\nMy big fear of all this new technology is we're losing sight of what it is to lead a good life. It doesn't mean saying no to technology but it means using it to be happier, fuller, richer, calmer.\n\nBut it's not really worked out this way. We actually work fewer hours than any other time in history and we spend these precious new hours gained on doing stuff to ensure we're not able to be alone with our thoughts. We find screens to block out life. The rush of notifications to block out loneliness.  Quasi connections to feel part of something, while many lives lack meaning or are overwhelmed with a slight sense of being a bit lost . \n\nMaybe it won't be like this, maybe each hour gained from vacuuming will be spent in the soup kitchen, each moment returned to us, will be a gift to learn a new language or a skill. \n\nLets hope like it always does, tech allows us to move up to be more human, more valuable and to be less in danger of large things smashing our limbs. \n\nUnless, somehow, this time it's different.",

That weighed on me\" \n\n3) Measurement bias kills magic\n\n\"We talk about what we can measure, and then assume that's all that matters. That's a lie.\"\n\n4) Products are not just tools; they are reflections of culture, belief, passions and our collective soul.\n\n\"What we make stands testament to who we are. And what we make describes our values, our preoccupations\"\n\n5) “What kills an idea is people’s urge to express their opinion.\n\n\nI'm not one to parrot quotes from someone, I'm not even the biggest fan of Jony's designs ( I prefer Benjamin Hubert from Layer ) , but I absolutely love these ideas.\n\nAnd I'm terrified in the world of the arithmatocracy, measurement and the move towards soulessly stripping out what makes the world feel magical,  these points are essential to ponder.\n\nIn short, everything matters.

    "Tom Goodwin's post 6d ago": "Best Practice is the scourge of business success and it kills me.\n\nTake for example, something I actually know a lot about, Car Dealer Websites.\n\nTo any normal human being, this site is, by pretty much any measure, in almost every way, absolutely awful.\n\n👎 It's incredibly ugly, it's hard to use, it's slow, messy, not up to date, not helpful. \n👎 It does nothing to create confidence, to make the brand appear premium, it does nothing to create momentum into the purchase process. \n👎 To anyone outside the US, this site would seem dramatically awful, to anyone in the US, this is site is just how every car dealer website is.\n\nThese sites are all so bad, not because the car dealer doesn't care, but because they care too much. They get sold to by companies offering terrible best practice at a cost.  So Millions of dollars are spent between advertising, hosting fees, data plug ins, AI retargeting, etc.\n\nThey've spend years and years honing the site to be this bad, because they follow advice, they don't think. \n\nLet's take a few examples.\n\nCar imagery.\nTime and time again, research shows people want to see the \"real picture\" of a new car before they buy it. \nSo across the US, about a billion dollars a year is spent on taking pictures of cars. The only problem is that almost ALL new cars look terrible this way and it makes them all look like used ones.\n\nThere is a reason Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Polestar all use super glamorous AI generated images, it's because the cars look much better this way.  \n\nHow can a billion dollars be spent wasting time and energy taking pictures? \n\nit's because nobody wants to think or be different. .\n\nChatbots.\nEvery car site these days has a chatbot. \n\nAbout $1000 per month will be spent by each car dealer, pissing off the customer. \nMost people who ever visits the site hates them. \n\nThey typically turned off within seconds, only to reappear\n\nThe only issue is that the data that shows people who do engage with the bot are \"more likely to buy a car\". So car dealers get sold on the causal benefit\n\n-So does anyone measure how many people are pissed off?\n-Does anyone measure the impact on emails or phone calls?\n\nPeople selling technology present amazing cases by leaving out the fact that chatbots are a great way to ensure only the most dedicated keen customers use them, and use this data to lie about causal impact. \n\nI can go on and on and on\nI could also design a better car dealer website, and I have, in about 39 mins. I can do the same with CRM, with dealer management software, and then there are the billions spend on TERRIBLE ads, but let's blow that up another day.\n\nOne that would seduce, inform, move people further into the funnel, with passion and excitement\n\nBut nobody wants to do something thats different.\nThey want to be average.\nThey want to be the same, not different.\nThey want to not get fired, rather than make a difference.\n\nWhy not aim for more? Why not make a better site because it's not that hard to see what's better",

The idea that our roles were serious, that we needed to hang on to jobs, and health insurance.\n\nMaybe it was the technology, making us less connected, more distracted, paralyzed by stories of uncertainty and threats.  Oddly making our jobs more robotic, more removed from what mattered.\n\nMaybe it was the shortermism, the idea things needed to pay back immediately, that investing ( time and money ) in people was a bit of a gamble.

We don't want to seduce people into caring, we want to insert ourselves in places we can take credit. \n\nIt will engage you in conversational Cantonese to stoke your passions for luxury handbags and industrial rivets.\n\nTake a few seconds to unblock those ads, and then take a look and see what you get. Did a human see this? Did anyone care? Did anyone expect me, a human, to click? How can it think I'm female? A senior citizen? about to repaint my plane?\n\nI don’t think we realize how deeply nasty it all is; between the lies, the fraud, the scams, the bots, the targeting, the following, the harassment, the automated ways to spank budgets on fake clicks, faster than ever. It all makes pig butchering or 419 scams look rather sophisticated and above board.\n\nIn the last 25 years, almost every industry on the planet has seen leaps and bounds. Why hasn’t our industry progressed? \n\nIn 2000, when buying a car, you had to navigate a crap new car. Now, that has broken down; now it seems like ALL cars are spectacularly good. \n\nIn the last 25 years, we’ve seen TV shows become amazing, TV sets from our dreams become attainable, smartphones, rockets, space, the insurance claims process, solar panels, and even British Airways now has a semi-functional app on a couple of good days.\n\nThis is the first 1/3rd of my new piece for the drum, free to read,  click in the first comment below.\n\n.......\n\nAnd can someone explain to me how so many smart people are happy to sit by and watch us do the dumbest things out of any industry.

That seems about right.  But it's a lot of work and risk and rather dull.\n----\nSo let's say I'll scale up, I'll spend 30 mins finding decent leads at decent VC's and 15 mins per individual email. Making each attempt feel pretty personal and appropriate. I can get 260 emails out. It's the recipients who can decide if they are interested, not me.\n\nNow there was a time when this was probably the best idea. People would read a semi personalized email, find it polite, see the effort, appreciate the relevance and they'd not bother to read anything without manners & specificity. \n----\n\nBut now, with AI and whatnot, why would I bother to decide who is right.\nI can take the 50,000 or so people who evaluate companies around the world, I can select the 5,000 that do seed rounds,  are in the USA, who invest in AI or B2B or Auto or Adtech ,and just write \"plausible\" but generic emails, and let them establish if their interested.\n\nIs that the best approach?\nIs the effort to curate,be genuine, be specific, no longer signaling?\nIf my proposition is compelling, who am I to decide what they are interested in?\n\nBut where does this get us in the long term?\n\nThis has implications for all Sales, all recruitment, all outbound, the onus shifts from sender to reader, and where does that lead?",

    "Tom Goodwin's post 1w ago": "When did IT stop being the corporate plumber and become the architect of the future?”\n\nThe IT department has done a full 360. And we’re still dizzy.\n\nIn the ‘80s and ‘90s, IT was the corporate janitor; keeping the lights on, fixing printers, a cost center buried in the basement. It was about support, not strategy. A necessary evil, not a secret weapon.\n\nBy the 2000s, things shifted. \nIntranets, mobile phones, ERP systems, cloud experiments, cybersecurity, data strategies, these weren’t just nice-to-haves. \n\nThey gave you an edge. \nBetter tech meant smoother operations, happier employees, maybe a slight customer experience bump. \n\nBut IT still wasn’t the star of the show. It was the stage crew, not the lead actor.\n\n\nFast forward to the 2020s, and IT’s stolen the spotlight, or at least it should have.\n\nYour tech backbone isn’t just support, it’s your entire competitive advantage.  \n\nYour companies policies to AI adoption, your strategy for data, your approach to security, your views on new behaviors, new ways or working, these are front and center, not boring background.\n\nA seamless employee or customer experience can define your brand. \n\nTech isn’t a cost to minimize; it’s an investment to scale. \n\nThe CTO isn’t a backroom techie; they belong on the board, shaping the future.\n\nYour approach to tech now drives your business strategy. \n\nStanding still isn’t cheap, it’s catastrophic. \n\nThe opportunity cost of “we’ll upgrade next year” is a death spiral. \n\nA great day for IT isn’t 99.999% uptime; it’s a bold idea that rewrites your company’s future.\n\nFor years, we preached people > process > tools. \n\nHire brilliant minds, build slick processes, then pick tools to enable them. \n\nBut today? Tools should come first. \n\nPlatforms like AI, cloud, or low-code dictate the process, and we fit amazing people around them. \n\nIt’s not ideal, I want to be people first, but it’s reality.\n\nThe future is old vs. new, agile vs. massive. \n\nBut the real pivot is how you see IT: an enabler that keeps things running or a driver that changes the game. \n\nChoose wisely. Your growth depends on it.",

We need to reimagine how we approach AI.\n\nI think the problem comes from the fact that only 20% of Marketers feel fully confident using AI tools and it becomes a circle that reinforces itself. \n\nI personally use Gen AI in many ways, my favorite is when I’ve got a big idea I can’t express. \n\nThere is a funny expression that the best way to get the right answer on the internet, is to post a wrong one and wait for an expert to correct it. \n\nWell, ask AI for a first draft and it creates a decent first draft but one that inspires me to go over and do it properly.\n\nA lot of people need guidance, a lot of people need to play around more, and to experiment!

You get the idea\n\nThe thing is,  quite a lot of advertising works by shared connections, I need to know that other people think a Loewe bag is expensive\n\nThe thing is, quite a lot of advertising works appearing to be big/wasteful, if you've taken out an ad in Heathrow airport, you're Consulting service can't suck.  If it looks like maybe they only tried to reach me, why ?\n\nEssentially there is no data to suggest people want personalized ads.\n\nEssentially there is no broad data to suggest people like or demand or prefer unique ads, there are of course \"experiments\" run to show they work. \n\n\nThere is a lot of data that shows people like RELEVANT ads.\nThey also hate irrelevant ads.\nIn fact they only thing they dislike more that targeted ads, or privacy infringements, is \"irrelevant or annoying ads\" \n\nSo riddle me this, why doesn't the entire $1,000BN ad industry get obsessed over sightly better, slightly more relevant ads?\n\nAds saying \"5 new non-stop routes coming to Miami from May\"\nnot \"Tom, thanks for being loyal, how about this one specific Hotel ?\"\n\nAds for Golf equipment shown on the Golf Channel?, not for class action lawsuits for retired NFL players ( this happened) \n\nAds for snazzy tires when you're reading about F1, not private jet livery painting ( this happened) \n\nAds for Firestone tires when you're reading about the Grand Prix, not private jet livery painting ( this happened) \n\nAds for new cars, after spending 6 months researching them, not an ad for industrial rivets .\n\nBecause the thing about personalized ads nobody seems to want to say is that it's all absolutely and totally and precisely wrong, and not even generally fairly right. \n\nAim for generally right!",

The idea that somehow a full and balanced and close life can be derived from artificial beings seems so bereft from any understanding of what it is to be a person. \n\nNow I am sure for significant tranches of society it's a nice idea to use AI as a therapist and get advice, or to use as a coach to improve social skills, I'm sure for some people AI friends can be far better than no friends or toxic friends, but this shouldn't be the default swim lane to life.\n\nI've never felt more optimistic about what technology can to do make life, living ,  the world,  society better, IN THEORY.\n\nI've never been more terrified by the outlook and incentives and metrics being used by the most powerful people we've ever known to shape the future.  Friendship, closeness, intimacy, vulnerability, togetherness, meaning, is something way to precious to give to someone who makes money from attention and who made their money making an app to rate how hot people were.\n\nI do wonder what we can do to allow well balanced, well intentioned people drive technology roadmaps.

Sometimes yes, but often?  The modal purchases in the world are things we don't care about much, we satisfice, not optimize.\n\n -Normal flows\n\nAI may indeed tell me that Hitachi makes the best TV, but I'm going to pick Samsung or LG. \nAI may suggest the Volkswagen Jetta is the best sensible car for me but really, that's just not going to happen. \n\nWhen AI suggested Pet insurance I selected one of the options based on my familiarity of the brand.\n\nThe reality is that AI will help narrow the options but it won't normally choose for us. We buy things for many emotional reasons that AI won't for some time be able to understand, we like in many cases thinking about this stuff.\n\n -Normality\n\nWhen push comes to shove, when you digest all of the AI changes in the world and there will be many, and they impact how we shop, they don't lead us to a different place.\n\nIn order to rank highly on AI search you need people to talk about you on Reddit,in Forbes, on YouTube, in books, in mainstream media, on forums.  \n\nTo do this you need to do everything you've always done before, and seemingly nothing else. Good products, good service, a good Social and PR strategy and good SEO game\n\nIn order to pass the legitimacy test, to appear trusted or snazzy, to be selected from options, you need what you always needed, Good products, & good brand awareness.",

What can our approach to certain jobs be?\n\nAnd lastly, at the atomic level\nWe can take a job approach, what does AI mean for the way we do set tasks, like our expenses, or writing emails or filing in timesheets. What can our approach to set tasks be? \n\n---\nThere are other ways\n- you can find a single geographical office and let them test and learn\n- you can find a new solution from AI, and figure out where to put it.\nThere are more, but thats for another day.\n---\n\nIn the rush to embrace AI, companies generally have failed to make an company wide AI strategy, they re applying it where it's easiest, fastest and requires least integration or imagination, which is from the bottom up.\n\nThey start with tactics, initiatives, prototypes, and hope for the best.\n\nThey will see massive security issues.\nThey will see legal and IP issues.\nThey see progress thats disconnected with any corporate vision or plans. \nThey will see quality control problems, failure and poor returns.\nThey will see data governance issues, data quality issues and a lot more.\n\n---\nIn an ideal world companies could be start at the top, with a vision for an AI reoriented company, but thats probably too bold.\n\nProbably the best place to start is at departmental level, based on the company roadmap, in what ways can I use AI to rethink the process, people, tools and workflows of this entire unit.\n\nFor example what does Marketing become in the era of AI and how do we make it?\n\nThats what I'm focussed on,\n\nMore on this to come.",

You're competition seems irrelevant or the economy.\n\nYou grow your newsletter, you send more frequently, you measure everything good that happens, each incremental conversion.\n\nYou use the funds to reach more people, try more ads, you're scaling. \n\nYou're still growing the base, your existing customers are buying again. \n\nYou're spending a lot on ads, mostly meta, some snap, some google,  but it's all an investment, your ROAS is 4.34, every dollar you spend comes back.\n\nAnd now you need to reach more people, so you're buying new audiences, broader audiences, but the conversion is down from before. You try influencer marketing but you can't really track it, or what you track seems low, you're temped by TV, CTV, but again the ROAS seems WAY lower. \n\nYou're now in the digital ad trap.\n- You forgot to build a brand, it seemed too expensive. \n\n- You forgot that once you experience ROAS above 3, you can't ever do something that you either can't track, or tracks lower. Your business isn't able to handle all routes ahead.\n\n- You got addicted to short term, attributable impact.\n\n- You spent your whole time fishing in a tiny pond, thrilled that you kept getting bites, you didn't know how limited the appeal of your product was. You ignored the Ocean. \n\n- You got incredibly good at finding interest, channeling interest, and you never learned how to CREATE interest, to seduce new people. \n\n\n\n\nThat's the thing about brand vs growth marketing only one GROWS the business, and it's the one without growth in the title. Most growth Marketing should be called conversion marketing. \n\nThe secret isn't to abandon the performance marketing playbook, it's to do it with other things and to recognize that most things that create long term success, seem like errors. Wastage is good. Slow is good. Non attributable is good, non trackable is good. Ads that people don't click on are good. \n\nIt's vital to understand both and respect each other",

Or which note in a song was most loved. Or what seam is best on a dress.\n\nAds are things working together \n\n2) Ads work in a context.\nThe place, time, audience, weather, news, location,  competitor activity,  screen used, are all as important as the ad itself, advertising is the art of balancing the two.\n\nWhich brings me to my main point. \n\nBroadly speaking there are two schools of marketing.\n\nONE - Those who think with enough data, everything can be learned.\nAnd once this playbook exists, it can be turned into reverse to make media plans, scripts, visuals, offers.\n\nThey seek to measure everything, control for everything, optimize everything\n\nTWO - Those who think there are far too many variables, that advertising is a form of art, magic, psychology, wonder, imagination. \n\nThat most things that matter can't be known. That we don't really know how advertising works, that impacts are mostly long term.\n\n\nGenerally speaking I'm more towards the latter.\nMost things we do we can't explain.\n\nWhat made me pick the Samsung monitor in front of me, why do I have Warby Parker glasses, what made me choose this Bic pen, the San Pellegrino water. \n\nIn general, what we don't know about advertising is far greater than what we do know.\n\nMost of the time we only measure the positive things.\n\nOften what we do know, may not be right.\n\nThere are things we can learn, experiments we can run, hypothesis to test, you can belief it's art, magic and mystery but also want to understand it more.\n\nHow these two tribes reconcile and learn from each other over the next few years will be key. \n\nMaybe we will learn more how ads work, or maybe we will see with greater clarity, what can't ever really be understood, because maybe people are more complex than code.",

One person's AI project is another persons macro, or computer modeling, or reasonably competent use of 1970's databases. \n-\nBy and large, if a company is using AI to elicit a specific miraculous benefit, they won't be telling you.

    "Tom Goodwin's post 1mo ago": "I'm weird, but this the sort of journey I go on after someone suggested I should get a dashcam for my car. And I end up getting confused about the world. \n\nFirst, I don't have time or inclination to know anything about Dashcam's, so I search for Brands I trust to see what models they make.  \n\nA Sony or Samsung or LG  should provide all the reassurance I need that I'm not buying something crap. But none of those brands make them....nor do optics brands like Canon or Panasonic, or accessory brands like Anker or Belkin, or innovative brands like Huawei or DJI, for some reason Dashcams are a $5bn business nobody bothers with.\n--\nSecond, I don't trust ANY of those \"Dashcam world \" blogs,  or Wired reviews or any videos, or any such because clearly they are compromised, so I research and it hits me I've never seen and ad in my life for a Dashcam, and thus have no idea what these brands are, Viofo, Vantrue, REDTIGER, DDPAI, so THREE ....how come the biggest brands in Dashcams are so, awfully named\n--\nFour, I look into features and they are all the same, I realize that the only thing I really care about is that it's incredibly easy to wire up, because it's gonna be very annoying having a lead across my dashboard or a trip to some installer to damage my car..... So we've somehow got 1500 types of dashcam, all basically the same. None are white, none are funky, none have a simple naming protocol,they are the same.\n--\nFive, it turns out nobody has bothered to invent a dashcam that's rechargeable. It seems to me that you'd easily be able to make one that works for 1 hour a day and you recharge once per week. \n--\nSix, then I dawns on me, you could actually make a really good baby / dog monitor and dashcam combo, you could plug it in and use it as one, charge it up, and use it as the other. Why has nobody made this?\n-\nBy this point, 34 mins in I'm getting bored of dash cams, so SEVEN I'm wondering how much money I will save on my insurance by getting one.\n\nAnd it turns out, absolutely none, it turns out no insurance policy in the entire world gives a crap!!.  There are no insurance companies that offer discounts to have one, there are no insurance policies who subsidize them, in a world of identical policies, and billions spent on advertising, why doesn't one auto insurer get a bit stuck in and decide to be the \"modern one\" and offer free dashcams???\n--\nAnd then I get even more grumpy, here I am with a Lucid, about to ruin the sleek lines of a car that already has 14 cameras in it. How did they manage to put 14 cameras in it, and not think to have a record function???\n\nIn fact, why is it that almost no cars on the road today, offer a in built dashcam, why is it not like a big thing?  ( outside of Teslas) , \n\nWhat is going on with the world?\n\nWe spend all day long spanking billions up the wall on parity products, why don't we just make something a bit better?\n\nI'm not grumpy, I'm just imaginative.\n\nWhy can't we make better things? Different things? New things?",

But strung together, they invite failure.\n\nThere’s an expression in computer science, AI attributes it to David C. L. Fogel (but that seems to be a total lie / sorry, hallucination) \n\n\"A computer should never ask a question it could reasonably deduce the answer to.\"\n\nThe promise of AI is that many things should be known.  Computers should figure things out, predict things, automate and help us, they should always be looking out and proactively helping.\n\nBut it's not that simple. \n\nThe strange thing about software to those not in it, is getting an intuitive sense of whats easy and what's impossible.\n\nThe sttrange thing about AI, even to those in it, is that it’s hard to know what’s going to be easy OR. what’s going to be perfect, OR what’s going to be error-prone OR borderline impossible. \n\nEven the people who know most about it, still don't get how it works\n\nAs a rough rule of thumb, it seems that anything requiring depth or specific, bounded brilliance is relatively easy.\n\nGenerate 1,000 cats a second? No problem.\nWin at Go? Done.\n\nBut anything requiring breadth, crossing systems, adapting to variety, is bizarrely difficult.\n\nTry asking AI to move a meeting, rebook your Uber, and change your flight. \n\nEach task in isolation is simple. But stitched together, they’re messy. \n\nSystems don’t talk to each other. Assumptions break. Ambiguity creeps in. \n\nAnd errors compound.\n\n\nAgentic AI is supposed to be the fix. I’ve seen demo videos. Heard the confident pitches. But I haven’t seen much real proof.

    "Tom Goodwin's post 2mo ago": "The big change in AI over the last 3 years wasn't that it got so very much better, it's that it got so very much easier to use. \n\nA lot of leapfrogs in technology happen when it gets better, or cheaper, but most happen when it gets easier. \n\nIn some ways AI is a bit like the Graphical User interface, it means lots of people can do a lot more, because the barriers to entry are lower, not because it wasn't possible to do the same stuff before. \n\n\nAnd now rather than a top down AI strategy, with considerations around security, governance, risk, IP, data ownership, process, benefits and threats. \n\nAlmost every real AI strategy and use case is driven bottom up, by 10,000 people in your company playing around with it.  This is pretty much unlike any tech movement ever.  It's out of control. Enthusiasm is everywhere but unchecked, unfocused. \n\nIt means tech fills the gaps, not reimagines the container.\n\nThe problem is that we don't need people to apply AI to how they work, we need companies to ponder what AI means for their company, and build processes and structures from this down. \n\nThere are so many better questions than how can we use AI. Things like how do AI change what you make, how you make it, how you sell it, distribute it, how does it change your competition or even the nature of your market or what it is to be a company in that sector today.",

They can buy innovation once done and stick sales, equity and assets on the bottom line directly, the financial risk is tiny.\n\nBut if Pepsi spent $10m each on 20 internal startups each year, given their resources, wouldn’t they not be almost guaranteed 1 win per year?\n \n Would it not be a huge driver for talent.\nA huge R&D lab for people to learn how to thrive with limited budgets. \nWould it not end up creating far more success because it’s in the best place ever to win from?\n\nIt’s always seem to me that there are big companies that are great at being big, small companies are great at being small and growing, and if you want to get a large company to become agile, entrepreneurial, to take risk, to thrive in a changed environment, the best way to do this is for them to spin off continuously small thrusting start ups",

It allows you to efficiently reach, re target, persuade, those who already have some interest. \n\nWay too many people think growth comes from conversion or that it’s more efficient when “all is does” is place itself ever ever ever closer to the point of purchase, to claim success , to place a pixel in an interested parties interest, to “prove” that it worked. One looks smart immediately , one pays back over a generation  \n\nBoth are vital. Both are amazing. Both go together like food and water.  And please no more silliness about 30% vs 70% or whatnot.

Security threat on max. \n\nRemember when employees needed corporate approval just to access work email on their phones? Or when installing software on a laptop required IT clearance? \n\n\nThose controls don’t exist with generative AI, making adoption near impossible to regulate and introducing major security risks.\n\nSo, should AI leadership be centralized? Should it be department-driven? \n\nOr should it be a localized experiment?\n\nDepartmental: How does Marketing or Legal integrate AI?\n\nRegional: Let the New Zealand office trial it and see what happens.\n\nCenters of Excellence: Establish internal AI hubs—but good luck enforcing usage policies.\n\nPersonally, I believe in a senior AI leader who:\n✅ Champions AI at the highest level\n✅ Crafts a company-wide AI strategy\n✅ Puts in place boring things like security protocols and starts to think about Data strategy and governance \n✅ Establishes design sprints, testing frameworks, and structured innovation\n\nAI will reshape businesses in ways we’ve barely begun to understand.

Her joy and deep sense of altruism are truly remarkable.\n\nThe film is called An Open Door—a fitting title, as her legacy is all about opening doors for others. Case in point: She uses proceeds from her books and speaking engagements to fully fund graduate school for over 20 students—debt-free!\n\nShe’s widely recognized, often stopped in airports by people touched by her work. And after our screening, she stayed to take photos and chat with hundreds of attendees.\n\nI think, like me, they admire what she stands for: that there is beauty and value in our differences, that diverse ways of thinking drive innovation, and that neurodiversity is vital to society.\n\nAs she says: “The world needs all kinds of minds.”\n\nI was honored to represent the National Women's Hall of Fame, which exists to share the stories of extraordinary women like Dr. Grandin.\n\nHuge gratitude to John Festervand (Colorado State University) for helping preserve her legacy, John Barnhardt (Johnny B!!) for his dedication to women’s stories, and Jacob Faulkner  & Tyler Naretto for their artistry.\n\n✨ An Open Door will be released later this year. \nLearn more: https://lnkd.in/eKtjiZ5W\n\nSpecial thanks to Children's Health Council + Devyn Maugel, Stanford Neurodiversity Project + Emily Hsiao, Dr. Lawrence Fung , and my colleagues at the Hall— Beckie Robertson, Jean Kilbourne, Roger Schwartz and Anjana Samant.\n\nTruly, the best birthday ever. 🎉",

I'll point to his full post below.\n\nThis gap between the CFO and #CMO is feeling a bit like a bad dream and the wrong kind of deja vu. \n\n8-10 years ago, we saw a wave of #martech emerge to help tackle the problems marketers had tracking our budgets and proving ROI. \n\nBut, these tools have all been acquired by larger platforms, and yet the gap has remained.\n\nI believe this conundrum has always been about two components: marketers being stewards over the dollars entrusted to them, and the painstaking work of keeping everyone on the same page - ensuring everyone knows what is expected of the department. \n\nOnly 38% of CFOs believe their CMO consistently collaborates effectively with other executives? \n\nOnly 34% see eye-to-eye with their CMOs as to how marketing can support enterprise growth? \n\nYikes.

If your brand isn’t cited, it’s invisible.\n\n2) Story discovery\n\nBefore: SEO and keywords.\nAfter: Camera-as-query. Visual search demands assets that speak for themselves.\n\n3) Media interviews\n \nBefore: Zoom fatigue.\nAfter: “Beam” 3D calls. Spokespeople need presence that feels in-room, not on-screen.\n\n4) Email outreach\n \nBefore: Clever pitches stood out.\nAfter: AI-crafted replies mimic tone. Relationships now matter more than formatting.\n\n5) Global briefings\n\nBefore: Time zones and translators.\nAfter: Real-time voice translation in your own voice. Multilingual comms is the new default.\n\n6) Thought leadership\n\nBefore: Ghostwritten op-eds.\nAfter: Gemini Advanced ($250/mo) makes smart writing scalable. Real insight becomes the differentiator.\n\n7) Visual assets\n\nBefore: You controlled the narrative with B-roll.\nAfter: Imagen & Veo let newsrooms create their own. No assets = no control.\n\n8)Product PR\nBefore: Sizzle reels and demos.\nAfter: XR glasses mean launches are now immersive, not just informative.\n\nLet’s get real: If you’re not rewriting your PR strategy post-I/O, you’re already behind.\n\n#pr #googleio #earnedmedia #generativesearch #aiincomms\n Google Gemini Alphabet Inc.",

    "Shama Hyder's post 1mo ago": "“insightful” and “curious” reactions now matter more than likes on LinkedIn. \n\nThat’s straight from their own spring algorithm update.\n\nComments, thoughtful replies, and meaningful interactions now drive reach—while passive metrics like likes or impressions are being quietly deprioritized.\n\nBut that’s only half the story.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn’s Head of News, the platform is also heavily favoring timely, news-driven content.\n\nThink: hot takes, fast POVs, story-driven posts tied to current headlines.\nIn short, LinkedIn is trying to become the new home for real-time conversation—filling the gap left by Twitter (X).\n\nThose two signals—depth vs. speed—feel contradictory. And yet they’re both true.\n\nHere’s my theory:\n\nLinkedIn isn’t confused. It’s running multiple plays at once—because different teams have different KPIs.\n\nThe News team wants immediacy and trend velocity.\nThe Engagement team wants time-on-platform and quality conversation.\nThe Trust team wants credible, topic-aligned expertise.\nThe Design team wants minimalist, professional posts (no emojis, no hashtags, no clickbait aesthetics).\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like LinkedIn’s “best practices” contradict each other—this is why.\n\nAnd it’s exactly why you and your brand need to adapt across multiple fronts:\n\nWhat’s Working Right Now:\n\n1) Timely POVs.\n\nPosts that react to real-world news and industry trends get fast distribution—especially in verticals where trust is key and conversation is happening in the moment.\n\n2) Topic Authority.\n\nLinkedIn’s system now elevates content from users it associates with specific expertise. Consistency in what you talk about matters more than ever.\n\n3) Meaningful Interactions.\n\n“Insightful” and “Curious” reactions carry significantly more algorithmic weight than a like. Thoughtful comment threads are the new currency of reach.\n\n4) Longer Shelf Life for High-Quality Posts.\n\nGood content doesn’t just peak and die anymore. If it performs well, it can resurface weeks or even months later through the “Suggested for You” feature.\n\n5) Native > External.\n\nPosts that simply link out or repost without commentary are downranked. Originality, context, and adding your take are table stakes now.\n\n6) Video + Substance.\n\nShort, vertical, subtitled videos (30–90 seconds) perform best when paired with a full multi-paragraph text post. The format is evolving, not replacing.\n\nSo what do you do with all this?\n\nStop trying to reverse-engineer one tidy strategy.\n\nYou’re not optimizing for a single algorithm—you’re navigating a platform with layered incentives and competing internal agendas.\n\nInstead, play multi-dimensional content chess:\n\nMix formats: short, long, video, reposts\nBalance immediacy with depth\nBuild topic authority over time\nEngineer conversations, not just visibility\n\nRelevance isn’t static.\n\nAnd on LinkedIn in 2025, movement is the strategy.\n\nCurious—have you seen a shift in your own content performance lately?",

ChatGPT didn’t exist yet, but I could already feel the shift toward intelligent aggregation.\n\n\t3.\tThat video would move beyond TV and live in our pockets—before TikTok, Reels, or vertical video were even part of the conversation.\n\nPeople laughed.\n\nI remember the looks. The polite nods. The subtle dismissal.\n\nBut I wasn’t wrong.\n\nAnd for the people who listened?

It’s a branding failure.\n\nThe $350M Snow White remake opened to just $43M — and the response has been brutal.\n\nSo what went wrong? And what can your brand learn from it?\n\n1. Your spokesperson is your brand. When the film’s lead called the original “weird,” it alienated loyal fans.\n\nYou don’t build trust by mocking the foundation you’re standing on.\n\n2. Know what made you iconic.\n\nThe original Snow White was a groundbreaking leap in animation and storytelling.\n\nDisney didn’t just update the story — they erased its essence.\n\nTrying to retrofit every character into the same empowerment arc dilutes what made them distinct.\n\n3. Innovation beats repetition.\n\nWalt Disney built an empire by pioneering, not recycling.\n\n When your strategy becomes “just remake what worked,” you're not innovating — you’re coasting.\n\nThis isn’t just about movies.\n\nBrands like Blockbuster, Nokia, and Toys \"R\" Us all had equity — until they forgot their core and stopped evolving.\n\nBrand equity is a goodwill account.\n\nWithdraw from it too many times without reinvesting, and eventually, it runs dry.\n\nThe brands that will thrive in 2025 won’t be the ones with the most IP or the loudest campaigns.\n\nThey’ll be the ones that listen to their audience, honor their origins, and innovate with clarity.\n\nI hope Disney listens.\n\nMake sure your brand does.\n\n#BrandStrategy #MarketingLeadership #Innovation #Storytelling #ConsumerTrust #AudienceConnection #BusinessLessons #Disney",

I will be all over brand plans, demand generation & in-market execution. That is where I will spend 95% of my time.”\n\n↳ translation? growth happens when leadership is obsessed with demand creation.\n\n↳ he is, in essence, saying the CEO should own marketing.\n\nthis is rare. while most executives delegate consumer connections, fernandez is making it clear: staying essential starts at the top.\n\n2. the marketing revolution\n\nfernandez is ripping up unilever’s marketing playbook. his focus? shifting from top-down branding to desirability at scale.\n\nhis plan:\n\n↳ increase marketing spend from 13% to 16%+\n\n↳ shift social media spend from 30% to 50%\n\n↳ work with 20x more influencers\n\nthis is empathy in action. big brands no longer control the conversation—people do.\n\nwinning companies won’t just push their message. they’ll build systems of advocacy where real people, in real time, amplify relevance.\n\n3. the premium imperative\n\nunilever is shifting from 35% premium to 50% premium. why?\n\nbecause each incremental unit delivers a 60%+ gross margin.\n\nfernandez’s mantra? “desire at scale.” not just marketing hype—injecting desirability into everyday products through superior functionality, aesthetics, and sensory experiences.\n\n↳ the commodity trap is a mindset, not a market reality.\n\n↳ when you elevate the experience, you elevate the margin.\n\nbottom line:\n\nwhether you’re running a startup or leading a Fortune 500 division:\n\n- be a frontline leader—growth happens at the customer level, not in strategy meetings\n\n- stop relying on corporate messaging—build systems where authentic voices advocate for you at scale\n\n- find your premium angle—even a commodity business can create “desire at scale”\n\nremember: the companies that stay essential won’t wait for change. they’ll create it.\n\n#leadership #marketing #growth #transformation #strategy #relevance \n#ceoinsights #cmoinsights",

Her playbook for leaders and entrepreneurs:\n\n1️⃣ Play the long game – She turned down Elvis wanting to record \"I Will Always Love You\" to keep her publishing rights. That decision later earned her millions when Whitney Houston recorded it.\n\n2️⃣ Own your brand – \"Find out who you are, and do it on purpose.\" When you're unmistakably YOU, you become unforgettable.\n\n3️⃣ Expand your brand – From music to Dollywood to films to books—she built multiple revenue streams while staying true to her vision.\n\n4️⃣ Generosity is a super power – Her Imagination Library has given over 200 million books to children. Her legacy isn't just wealth, it's impact.\n\n5️⃣ Stay relevant – At 79, she's collaborating with new artists and reaching new audiences. Reinvention isn't optional—it's essential.\n\n💡 This is part of my new series: Business Lessons from People Who Did It Their Way. Who should I feature next?

    "Shama Hyder's post 4mo ago": "Why do most transformation initiatives fail?\n\nThey lack the strategic focus on attention, relevance, and loyalty—the principles that history’s greatest change agents understood so well.\n\nHere’s the difference:\n\nMost leaders try to push change through authority or power. But transformational leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. knew how to capture attention, stay relevant, and build movements grounded in loyalty.\n\n1. Movements beat moments.\n\nWhen Gandhi led the Salt March in 1930, it wasn’t just about salt—it was about laying the foundation for a broader independence movement. The symbolic act rallied millions and created sustained momentum. Transformation isn’t about quick wins; it’s about creating relevance that endures.\n\n2. Pressure points matter more than power.\n\nKing didn’t try to tackle segregation everywhere at once. Instead, he focused on one strategic lever: the Montgomery bus system. By disrupting it, he sparked systemic change. Transformation succeeds when you focus attention on critical levers that create ripple effects.\n\n3. Shared values trump force.\n\nGandhi united a diverse India by emphasizing shared values like freedom and dignity, while King’s “I Have a Dream” speech inspired millions by anchoring his vision in universal ideals. Building on what connects us fosters loyalty and dissolves resistance.\n\nHere’s the key takeaway:\n\nThese aren’t just lessons from the past; they’re essential for today. In a world of constant disruption, attention, relevance, and loyalty are the bedrock of lasting transformation.\n\nThe bottom line: Lasting change isn’t forced—it’s earned through strategic patience, precise focus, and a shared vision.\n\nRemember: The fastest path to change isn’t always direct. Sometimes, the longest way around is the shortest way home.\n\n#leadership #relevance #attention #loyalty #transformation",

The future of media—and it's not what you think.\n\nTechCrunch just announced another round of layoffs, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEarlier this month, The Washington Post made a move that signals an even bigger shift: they dissolved their traditional PR team in favor of a new \"Star Talent Unit.\" \n\nWhy? Because they recognize that the future of media influence isn't just about institutional authority – it's about individual voices and direct audience connections.\n\nImagine Kim Kardashian as a legal contributor for the Washington Post. One Instagram post from her about a WP story could generate millions of views and engagements – more reach than any of their stories.\n\nSound far-fetched? It's already happening:\n\n↳50% of journalists globally are now freelancers\n↳Creator-journalists are building massive direct audiences\n↳Legacy media is betting on personality-driven content\n↳The lines between journalism, influence, and audience engagement are disappearing\n\nI've been beating this drum long before 2019. The future isn't just about earned media or paid placements – it's about understanding how these boundaries are dissolving. \n\nWhen a journalist-turned-creator posts sponsored content that goes viral and gets picked up by traditional media, is that earned, paid, or owned? \n\nThe truth is, it's all of the above.\n\nThis isn't disruption. It's evolution. The traditional silos of paid, earned, and owned media are merging into one integrated ecosystem where influence flows freely between channels.\n\nCreator partnerships blur into journalism, social posts transform into news coverage, and branded content drives organic conversation.\n\nThe Washington Post's move isn't just a restructuring – it's validation of what I've known all along: success in today's media landscape requires understanding this convergence. It's about building a multi-channel strategy.\n\nCreativity. \nFlexibility. \nResponsiveness. \n\nThis is the road to relevance. \n\nQuestion is: is your strategy still stuck in silos?\n\n#futureofwork #mediastrategy #pr #innovation #techcrunch",

AI use is required for all prototyping/planning discussions \n3. AI usage will be part of performance review \n4. AI learning is self-directed, but people are expected to share what they learn\n5.

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 1mo ago": "Will Voice Agents Crush the Consulting Business?\n\nVoice agents are a white-hot AI category for good reason. There are a slew of use cases where voice agents just completely decimate their non-agentic competition. \n\nAt Superintelligent  we built a voice agent to interview employees and leaders at companies as part of our Agent Readiness Audits. We can do dozens, hundreds, even thousands of interviews. In a day. In an hour. At a time.  In fact the only constraint is when it’s convenient for the interviewee. \n\nThis has gotten me thinking about the **immense risk today’s management consultants face.** \n\nWhat do consultants really charge for? \n\n1. Specialized expertise\n2. The time is takes to do information gathering and discovery \n3. Proprietary knowledge \n\nAI negates two of the three. \n\nIn a world of LLMs trained on the entire corpus of human knowledge, expertise moves from scarce and expensive to abundant and cheap. \n\nIn a world of on-demand voice agents, information gathering is only constrained by people’s willingness and availability to talk. \n\nProprietary knowledge remains differentiating. In the case of Super and our agent readiness audit, we spend a lot of time (well, at least the AI systems we’ve built do) maintaining an extremely up-to-date knowledge base of current agent capabilities. This isn’t data that’s organized elsewhere or easily found on the web. Other firms will have other specialized data sets and knowledge as well.\n\nSo how does the space evolve? It’s some combination of:\n\n- Value proposition in general reorients around unique/proprietary knowledge\n- Specialist niche firms with extremely specific focus start to outcompete\n- Legacy firms disrupt themselves or get disrupted\n- In general, cost for consulting comes down\n\nThe most exciting part (at least it should be) is that last bullet. \n\nThe cost of consulting (and professional services more broadly) coming down means that a greater variety of companies can deploy profservices across a broader array of opportunities. \n\nThe net result of all of this is, in fact, MORE consulting/profservices work. The big question is whether the legacy firms can adapt fast enough to command the same market share they do now. \n\nMy strong guess is: nope.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 6mo ago": "There’s growing chatter that frontier labs are hitting a wall in terms of AI capabilities. Does this mean your enterprise can slow down the urgency of AI adoption?\n\n𝗡𝗼𝗽𝗲, 𝘀𝗼𝗿𝗿𝘆.\n\nFirst, let’s explain what’s actually going on. This is all based on a report from The Information, whose sources at OpenAI said that the company has found the performance improvements of their latest model Orion to be not as significant as previous jumps in the state of the art. There’s some reporting that Google’s dealing with the same thing with the latest version of Gemini.\n\nThe nuance is that the challenge seems to be about the limitations of the previous method for scaling LLMs, which was throwing more data and compute at them during the pre-training process.\n\nTurns out, that’s not the only way to increase capabilities.\n\nWe’ve already gotten a preview of this with OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. That model uses a strategy called “test-time compute” which is a different approach during the inference phase, which happens after the model has been prompted.\n\nHere’s OpenAI researcher Noam Brown describing the results: “𝘐𝘵 𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢 𝘣𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 20 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘢 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘱𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘨𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘶𝘱 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘥𝘦𝘭 𝘣𝘺 100,000𝘹 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 100,000 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘴 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘳.”\n\nThe point is: just because one approach to scaling is showing limitations doesn’t mean that model advances are going to stop.\n\nWhat’s more, when it comes to the question of enterprise AI transformation, it’s not really about the state of the art.\n\nInstead, AI transformation is about analyzing existing workflows and processes and asking whether there is an AI powered alternative - be it an AI-assisted human process or an Agent automated process, that would be more effective - in a never-ending loop.\n\nWe’re so barely scratching the surface of what today’s models can do to improve efficiency and create new opportunities that a change in how the big labs are thinking about scaling really just doesn’t change anything about the lived reality of AI for companies.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 7mo ago": "GenAI transformation is the defining challenge and opportunity for enterprises right now. Here are 5 big blockers to enterprise AI adoption.\n\n1. Unclear mandates\nAI transformation has to start from the top. Not only do executives need to be talking about GenAI, they need to be using GenAI, and they need to be painting a vision for the company’s future empowered by GenAI. Employees need to know that 1) GenAI adoption is a priority; and that 2) it’s a priority not because leadership wants to fire half the company and do the same with less, but because they want to realize the AI opportunity to do more and better things than we’re ever possible before.\n\n2. Invisible Usage\nOne of the reasons that clear mandates from the top are so important is that right now much of AI usage in the enterprise is invisible - either because there aren’t systems for sharing (see below) or because employees are purposefully keeping their AI use secret. Many employees using AI are worried they’re breaking rules, worried their work will not be treated as legitimate, or worried that using AI will make them seem replaceable. Microsoft/LinkedIn found that of the 75% of knowledge workers using AI, 78% weren’t telling anyone about it.\n\n3. Use Case Confusion\nGenAI is self evidently powerful. Exactly what to use GenAI for to get value, however, is less clear. Most companies are still at the stage where every employee has to act like a use case explorer, tinkering, experimenting, and hopefully finding something that works. This is radically inefficient, and leads to anemic adoption and lots of repeated mistakes. By the way, invisible usage exacerbates this problem. Invisible usage means that people don’t get to learn from each other’s experience.\n\n4. No Systems for Sharing Best Practices\nSometimes usage is invisible because employees are worried about the reaction to them using AI. But a lot of times it’s invisible because there simply aren’t currently structures and systems for them to share what they’re learning. Companies need robust, ideally software driven systems for capturing information about AI usage and distributing best practices across the organization. ahem superintelligent ahem\n\n5. Inertia and a Need for Evangelism\nThe constraining factor on AI won’t be technological, it will be based on human and organizational inertia. Increasingly, we’re seeing enterprises recognize that even as they create mandates, and work to build systems for sharing, they need to be loud about that work. We’re even seeing (and helping!) some companies start entire internal facing marketing campaigns evangelizing AI use.\n\nWhat are the barriers you’re seeing?",

Anthropic announced “Computer Use.” It is exactly what it sounds like: Claude is now able to use the computer as a human would, pointing, clicking etc.\n\nThis is currently only available as an experiment, and it is only available through the API, meaning it requires a developer to put it into practice. What’s more, at this stage it’s functionally very expensive, and priced more for experiments than for being built into actual products or services.\n\nAnd yet, it very clear points in the direction of a very, very different future. Rather than having to adapt our workflows to LLMs, this shows how LLMs are increasingly just going to be able to imitate us.\n\nAnthropic found that when they empowered Claude with these new capabilities, it unlocked new functionality that the model hadn’t been trained on:\n\n\"We were surprised by how rapidly Claude generalized from the computer-use training we gave it on just a few pieces of simple software, such as a calculator and a text editor…In combination with Claude’s other skills, this training granted it the remarkable ability to turn a user’s written prompt into a sequence of logical steps and then take actions on the computer. We observed that the model would even self-correct and retry tasks when it encountered obstacles.\"\n\nIn the very short time Claude computer use has been available, developers have experimented with things like:\n🤼 Automated moderation of a Facebook group including accepting and rejecting new members\n💻 Automated feedback and debugging of code\n🍕 Ordering pizza for the Anthropic team as they were working on it\n\nLike OpenAI’s release of their reasoning o1 model, this is a very small baby step towards the agentic future. But baby or not, it is a step. I believe that when we look back, we’ll see both o1 and Computer Use as branches off on the AI evolutionary tree, away from previous LLMs and towards something new.",

Here are 3 ideas for how to use it for business. \n\nA couple months ago, NotebookLM from Google launched a feature called \"Audio Overview\" which basically could autogenerate a podcast about any document or set of documents. \n\nThe output is unbelievable impressive, but hasn't been guidable until now. With NotebookLM's latest features, you can click \"Customize\" in Audio Overviews to give more specific instructions, such as telling it to focus on a particular topic; emphasizing one source over the others, or changing the audience it's for. \n\nThis instantly makes NotebookLM Audio Overviews 1000% more useful for content creators and businesses. Which is good news, because Google claims 80,000 orgs are already using it for business. \n\nHere are 3 ideas for how to use NotebookLM Audio Overviews for business:\n\n1. Customer Service Insights -- feed it the transcripts of the day's (or week's) customer service calls and have it create a podcast about the most important insights that anyone in the company can learn from in just 5 or 10 minutes. \n\n2. Conversational Sales Pitch -- most companies have lots of written materials about their offerings, but that's different than pitching services in person. Share those materials with NotebookLM and see how it emphasizes the benefits and opportunities of the product or service in a conversational way. \n\n3. Weekly Project Reporting -- there are lots of meeting transcription and summary services, but NotebookLM could take internal alignment a step further. Imagine giving it the transcripts of all of a week's meetings from Fireflies or Otter and letting it create a summary podcast for execs that gives a birds eye view of where a project is and how it's proceeding. \n\nWhat use cases are you finding for NotebookLM?",

Over the last decade and a half, SaaS companies became integrated with just about every business workflow that exists. Enterprises could simply subscribe to the software, turning it off and on and expanding and contracting the size of their engagement at will. In general, SaaS worked on a cost-per-seat business model.\n\nMoving forward, generative AI will remake pretty much every business workflow once again. Broadly speaking; remaking will take two forms:\n1. Improved workflows undertaken AI-assisted humans\n2. Improved workflows undertaken by AI agents, managed by humans and/or other AI’s\n\nService-as-a-Software is the natural result of AI agent implemented workflows. In this model, the companies provisioning agents aren’t selling software that improve’s human work, but actually selling a version of the labor itself.\n\nOne of the most consequential changes emerging is around business model. When you’re selling the work itself, rather than an assistant to work, the per-seat model ceases to make sense. The new exploration is in pricing the actual outcomes and output.\n\nWe’re at the very early innings of this transition. How agents get integrated into existing processes is still a wide-open question. It’s also still too early to know how the business model norms will resolve.\n\nStill, it’s a big, consequential change, and one that you’re going to hear a lot more about in the months to come.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 7mo ago": "Here's something most companies will get wrong about AI at first:\n\nAI is a \"more with the same\" tech, not a \"the same with less\" tech. \n\nAaron Levie framed this on X this morning [see attached image] around Jevon's Paradox -- that increasing the efficiency of a resource actually tends to increase demand for the resource. \n\nAn unacknowledged assumption in a lot of the fears around AI is that the current demand we have for [everything] is the natural or max demand society has for that thing. So if that thing can be provisioned with far fewer resources, that means less work for the people doing the provisioning. \n\nFor example: if code is 1/10th as hard to create, then we'll only need 1/10th the coders. \n\nThe history of human experience shows us, however, that our ability to expand demand and consume more is pretty much endless. If code is 1/10th as hard to create, we wont have 1/10th the coders; we'll just produce 10x as much code. \n\nIn fact, even that is probably wrong. If code becomes 1/10th as hard to create, not only will today's coders produce 10x, but a whole new wave of people who wouldn't have been creating code before will get involved, so the net impact will be even more than 10x the code. \n\nBringing this back to companies, MANY are going to fall into the trap of thinking that AI is a \"doing the same with less\" technology, where they can get the same output with lower input costs. Initially, these companies may even be rewarded by markets focused entirely on the short-term who love cost cutting. \n\nIt won't take long, however, before they start to be wildly outcompeted by companies who realize that the real opportunity isn't \"the same with less,\" but \"more with the same,\" (and eventually even \"much, much, much more output with just a little more input\"). \n\nThe faster we can get bigco's thinking in \"more with the same\" terms, rather than \"the same with less\" terms, the better for everyone.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 7mo ago": "5 Reasons Workers Are Keeping AI Use Secret\n\nWhat’s true: workers are using AI. A Microsoft/LinkedIn study from earlier this year found 75% of knowledge workers using AI. A McKinsey survey from August put it at 91%.\n\nWhat’s also true: they’re keeping their usage quiet, if not outright secret. That first survey also found that, of those using AI, 78% weren’t telling any one.\n\nEthan Mollick called these users “Secret Cyborgs” and discussed why they’re keeping their AI use secret in a recent essay [linked in comments]. Riffing off that and adding my own experience, here are 5 reasons workers are keeping their AI use secret:\n\n1. They’re not sure what their company thinks about AI use. Most companies haven’t done a great job yet being clear about what is and isn’t okay. In many cases, that’s because they haven’t decided what is and isn’t okay. But given that workers are trying to do work better, not break rules, until there is more clarity, they’re keeping quiet.\n\n2. They don’t want their work to be seen as illegitimate. Work culture often focuses on measures of inputs like how long someone worked on something as a proxy for quality. This can easily lead to a fear of AI-enabled work being perceived as somehow “cheating.”\n\n3. They don’t want more work. Who owns the productivity gain of AI usage? Is it the employee who does things 25% faster and now has more time for other things, or is it the company who can now assign 25% more work. Some AI smuggling behavior is a byproduct of a fear that employers will just fill in newly available time with more tasks.\n\n4. There’s no good way to share what they’re doing. Even if a person wanted to tell all of their colleagues about the valuable use cases and new AI workflows they’ve uncovered, what’s the mechanism to do so? Enterprises new scalable systems to make AI usage visible. This is the central problem Superintelligent is solving.\n\n5. Simply put: they’re terrified someone is going to tell them they’re not allowed to use AI anymore. Once you go from a non-AI workflow to an AI-enabled workflow, most people truly can’t imagine going backwards. If there is ANY chance that revealing AI usage could lead to being told you’re not allowed to do that thing which makes your worklife so much better, people are going to stay silent.\n\nWhich of these are you seeing?",

Andrej Karpathy's not wrong -- the audio generation aspect really has some of the most magic since ChatGPT \n\n2. NotebookLM being successful won't mean fewer human-produced podcasts. It will mean a total renaissance in audio content consumption, where anything can be reviewed, learned, understood via Socratic audio. Likely to increase the podcast audience size, not reduce it. \n\n3. ElevenLabs is actively contributing to this as well. They just launched the ability this week for indie authors to create audiobooks effortlessly. Feels to me like Perplexity is going to have a stake here as well as they push the frontier of how you present collections of knowledge on the AI-enabled internet. \n\n4. Back to Notebook, I so desperately want more fine grain control. Right now the excitement is the wonder of this incredibly impressive automated artifact, but I want the ability to actually guide the audio generation. That's where it will really take off and become next level. \n\n5. As a creator-consumer-builder, very exciting to see Google firmly remind it's got AI platform game. \n\nGreat work to all who worked on this! \n\nPS -- first NotebookLM component of an @AIDailyBrief coming this weekend!",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 1yr ago": "So who won: OpenAI or Google?\n\nIt's clear now why OpenAI felt they needed to get their Spring Update ahead of Google I/O. Google went for a \"shock and awe\" strategy announcing a huge number of AI products and updates.\n\nThe watchword for the whole presentation was \"integration.\" More than ever, Google's AI is in every single Google product. Google isn't just grafting AI on to their existing products (which was what we saw last year from Google), they're updating their products with generative AI as the center of the product experience. This was particularly apparent in the integrations with Gmail, Search and AI Teammate for Google Workspace.\n\nOne thing that was shared between OpenAI's presentation and Google's presentation was the nudging towards an AI agent powered future. In many ways, the new features and products like GPT-4o and Project Astra are all retraining users on the types of human-computer interactions that will get them prepared for true agent experiences\n\nBy and large, the AI twittersphere was impressed with the announcements at Google. If there was a caveat with regard to Google's AI assistant tools like Project Astra, it's that there weren't live demos — Google presented pre-recorded videos. After they oversold Gemini Ultra last December, skepticism is higher.\n\nIndeed for the technically-minded Twitter AI community participants, OpenAI still came out ahead of this exchange. A poll from Stanford's Andrew Gao asking \"who wins AI today\" had OpenAI at 55.6% vs Google's 22.5%. Jenny AI from Microsoft asked \"So who won the week\" with OpenAI hitting 85.8% to Google's 14.2%.\n\nStill, the sheer quantity of announcements meant that most people weren't comparing whose AI assistant was the most state of the art. Even more than that, it's clear from I/O that Google isn't going after the AI Twitter community — they're going after the mass market of future potential AI users.",

    "Nathaniel Whittemore's post 1yr ago": "This is the most divisive OpenAI announcement event we've ever seen.\n\nSome feel like they've glimpsed the future; Samantha from Her or Jarvis from Iron Man brought to life. Others are left saying \"that's it?\"\n\nPart of this is about what this wasn't: it wasn't an announcement about GPT4.5 or GPT-5. There is so much attention on the state of the art horserace that for some, anything less than that was going to be a disappointment no matter what.\n\nWhat this was, ultimately, was a product announcement. OpenAI is betting on a totally new mode of interacting with AI. The breakout experience was the chatbot of ChatGPT, but this announcement shows that their bet on the future of human-AI interactions is actually chatting with voice and vision.\n\nProduct announcements are going to inherently be more divisive than technology announcements because it's harder to tell if a product is going to be truly different until you actually interact with it. And especially when it comes to a different mode of human-computer interaction, there is even more room for diverse beliefs about how useful it's going to be.\n\nThat said, the fact that there wasn't a GPT4.5 or GPT5 announced is also distracting people from the technological advancement that this is a natively multimodal model. It's not a text model with a voice or image addition; it is multimodal token in, multimodal token out. This opens up a huge array of use cases that are going to take some time to filter into the consciousness.\n\nLastly, and most practically, it's hugely significant that they've made this model available for free to everyone, as well as making the API 50% cheaper. That is a MASSIVE increase in accessibility.\n\nTop 3 things from the announcement:\n\n3 - Truly natively multimodal model - this will likely transform use cases for ChatGPT as much or more as increasing the intelligence of the underlying model\n\n2 - Free access to their most advance model - huge transformation in accessibility\n\n1 - OpenAI's big bet on a new mode of interaction - OpenAI's like they're making a huge bet that Her-style interactions will replace typing to chatbots as the way we interact with AI",

Hundreds of video tutorials and step-by-step how-to's get you using AI tools in minutes. It’s AI learning that's actually useful.\n\nCheck it out at https://besuper.ai/ \n\nAnd if you want to hear more about how it came about…well here we go…\n\nI don’t think I have to tell most of you that the end of 2022 was VERY weird. Yet in that chaos and wreckage, I found myself having the same experience that so many others were having — trying ChatGPT or Midjourney and:\n\n1. Feeling like a friggin' wizard harnessing the power of all creation\n2. Almost instantly becoming convinced that generative AI really was going to change everything.\n\nThat led me to launching The AI Breakdown podcast, which almost immediately became as popular as the original Breakdown podcast.\n\nThe common experience of all of the listeners I heard from was that they had also become convinced that AI was going to change everything about how they worked and what they worked on, and felt it was imperative that they keep track of what was happening.\n\nMore than news though, what they really wanted was resources to learn. Sure, there were courses out there, but they tended to be very old school, very theoretical, very fragmented and limited in what they covered, and almost immediately out of date as soon as they were published.\n\nSuperintelligent takes a totally different approach. We’re focused on getting people actually using the most important AI tools and learning by doing. We’ve built a content production operation that has produced 300+ video tutorials (plus step-by-step How-To’s that go with them) and is adding 30-50 a week.\n\nThat change is coming is undeniable. A survey of CEOs found that they believed that HALF their employees skills would be irrelevant in just 2 years. The IMF says that AI will impact 60% of American workers.\n\nMy belief is that the single biggest factor in whether the AI revolution actually benefits people the way it could, versus becomes just another disruption they have no agency in, will be education. That’s why we're building Superintelligent.\n\nGo to https://besuper.ai/ // and if it’s interesting to you, use code “nlwlaunch” (not case sensitive) to get $10 off your first month.

Everything from instruction on how to open the mailer without tearing apart the return envelope (seems obvious now but trust me, it was not at the time) to what to do if a DVD had issues.\n\nIt would be all to easy to look at that work now and think of it as wasted effort. But it wasn't at all. Not only did we help with customer retention (an by way of the eye-catching red mailer customer acquisition, see also word of mouth), it was one of the ways I learned, via consumer research, how to approach customer communication both visually and verbally. I gained experience learning about operations (which was impressive!). I got to work on ad integration in the mailer and co-branding with movie studios. And I worked closely with colleagues who helped shape what it meant to work in a high performance culture many who are still friends to this day.\n\nWhile it is a it sad to see the service shut down, it was always going to happen. It had a very good run.\n\nBy the way, the photos in this article are clearly lit to evoke a mood about the service and thus these job coming to an end.

When streaming launched in 2007, the world was surprised that a \"DVD company\" would even dare try something like streaming. But by that point we'd been working on it for years. Then the strategy shifted to one of device ubiquity. And in seemingly short order, Netflix was pre-installed on gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, and smart TVs. The remotes that came with them even had a Netflix button. And even while that was happening, the next strategic shift, to original content, was being worked on. \n\nAs someone who still owns and enjoys their Instant Pot it bums me out that the company (acquired in 2019 by Cornell Capital) is now filing for bankruptcy (and not just because we have to endure all kinds of \"meh\" level cooking metaphors in news reports). It is a solid product that built an amazingly rabid fanbase. Ultimately, though, more sales ≠ strategy.

But for decades, the name HBO has implied high quality original programming (btw, I'd bet that practically no one under the age of 50 thinks of it as \"Home Box Office\" anymore). The brand equity of that name is pretty remarkable built by decades of quality original content. Heck, it was the benchmark Netflix used when it launched it's originals ('the goal is for us to be more like HBO before HBO is more like us'). It would seem that the HBO brand would provide a halo effect for the newer content.\n\nSo, either Warner Bros.

Since then I have not been able to exercise whilst regulating my heart with aggressive medication and still with the prospect of open heart surgery. \n\nAfter being a keen runner / cyclist for many years, not being able to get out there on a regular basis has been messing with my mental health. \n\nAnyway I couldn’t stand it any more, so when I saw that the mental health charity Mind were doing a 300 mile sponsored bike ride in September I signed up to give me something to aim for. \n\nAnd I am so glad that I did. Firstly, it has completely reignited my love of cycling. Secondly, the physical benefits are clear (I feel much fitter and am sleeping better). And finally, my mental health has improved dramatically (as we all know mental and physical health work together in unison). \n\nIn the past week alone I have done 130 training miles and although I think I may need a new perineum and the hills seem a lot steeper than they used to be, I am loving every mile and every minute. \n\nSome people have said to me that I must be mad risking my heart health by taking up the challenge but I have checked with my cardiologist and she has said that as long as I don’t overdo it then I should be absolutely fine. And if I am not? Well I would rather die doing something that I absolutely love (for the record I also wouldn’t mind shuffling off my mortal coil watching football or in the throes of passion… though not necessarily on that order… and indulging in any of these activities is surely a better way out of here than just watching Netflix?!).\n\nBut anyway I digress, the real point of this post is to ask you a simple question. If you had the chance to buy me a coffee and have a quick chat, would you? \n\nWell that may not be totally practicable given the limitations of geography and availability but what if we could have a virtual coffee / chat instead?\n\nSo here is what I propose… if you make a charitable donation to Mind for the price of a coffee (let's say just a few pounds or dollars) on my JustGiving page for the Mind 300 Mile Bike Challenge in September 2022 then in return I promise to have a virtual chat with you on any topic you wish (work related or otherwise). \n\nYou will also be helping a brilliant mental health charity who are committed to helping people who are struggling with anxiety and depression which, in turn, is helping to save lives. \n\nAnd if just 1 in 100 of my Followers participate in the coffee / chat offer we could collectively raise over £60,000 for Mind - a win for everyone. And if not, then why not consider signing up yourself? \n\n#mentalhealth #work #people #cycling #charity #mind #health #love #mindfulness #linkedin #followers",

Plans to present.\n\nBut real product work begins with curiosity.\n\nNot surface-level questioning — real curiosity. The kind that pushes you to understand what customers are experiencing, even when the answers are unclear or inconvenient.\n\nTwo challenges tend to get in the way:\n\n1. The first is about skill. Most teams know that product discovery is essential. But few have built the domain expertise to do it well — to actually integrate discovery into product planning. Even our own team struggled here. That is why we created Aha! Discovery — to help manage interviews, uncover insights, and connect what you learn to what you build.\n\n2. The second challenge is about fear. Even with a mandate to talk to customers, many people hesitate. It can feel uncomfortable to probe — to keep asking questions until you get to the truth. But this is your responsibility as a product builder. You are not interrogating. You are listening with intent. Like a journalist searching for clarity.\n\nI recently shared a few tips that we give to new team members at Aha! for running better customer interviews. You can read them here:",

The answer is not simple.\n\nLately I have been meeting with product teams to talk about Aha! Discovery. The folks span industries and company sizes — from early-stage to complex enterprise organizations.\n\nThe challenges are surprisingly similar. Discovery still gets shortchanged. Conversations with customers are inconsistent. Ideas are scattered. And upstream work is not always connected to product plans.\n\nEveryone agrees it is important to get this right. But it is hard to change how the team works — especially when discovery has not been treated as part of the real work.\n\nThis is why teams that build a strong discovery practice now will be the ones best equipped to make meaningful product decisions in the future.",

But they learned something critical: Feedback — even hard feedback — improves outcomes. I have come to seek it out from trusted colleagues and customers, especially when making difficult decisions.\n\nHere is how I approach feedback now:\n1. Listen without reacting. Imagine you are floating above the scene. Focus on understanding the sharer's perspective rather than preparing your defense.\n2. Ask clarifying questions. What am I missing? How could I make this approach better?\n3. Take time to reflect. Feedback often reveals gaps or opportunities you might not have seen.\n4. Apply what resonates. Not all feedback will be actionable, but the best often challenges you to think differently.\n\nFeedback is not about personal judgment — it is about improving outcomes for everyone involved. When you see it this way, you start to actively seek it rather than avoid it.",

So the focus here is pursuing the minimum overhead needed to effectively deliver what customers will love — and for the team to be happy doing that work. \n\nYou start by removing the friction that typically occurs when there is tension and conflict around objectives and accountability. And you continue by removing every meeting that is not absolutely required. \n\nTo succeed, you need real insights and a true north. And you have to establish some defined ways of working. (Otherwise, you are relying on luck and are sure to experience chaos.) \n\nSo how do you know if you are very far from or very near to your own MTP?",

    "Justin Bariso's post 3d ago": "Ok. I just might lose my \"New Yawker\" card for this one.\n\nBut as much as I love this iteration of the Knicks, I gotta give credit where credit is due.\n\nThe Pacers pulled off an amazing win last night.\n\nIf you follow my work, you know I love analyzing these games for emotional intelligence lessons. So, as I watched emerging Pacers superstar Tyrese Haliburton's post game presser, something fascinating stood out.\n\nHere's his full quote:\n\n“We’re just a group that has spent a lot of time with each other. And I think the front office’s decision to keep the majority of our group together—basically our whole team together, essentially, after last year—I think it was really big. \n\n\"Because we’ve been through everything together. We’ve been on big losing skids, big winning runs, had to win in so many different ways, so many guys had to step up and make big shots. \n\n\"And I think in the NBA you don’t see a ton of continuity from year to year. Many teams are changing from year to year. Our front office did a great job of keeping this group together. I think this just gives us all confidence in each other...\n\n\"We have high expectations for each other, but I think we also hold each other accountable...I’ve seen people joke about us, [say] we’re like a college team. Because of how close we are and you know how we’ve been together and we’re all super young. \n\n\"Man, it’s just special. I love playing with these guys and look forward to keeping this run going.”\n\nI talk a lot about resilience—I call it a \"secret element\" of emotional intelligence. But Hali teaches a major lesson here in how teams actually build resilience. \n\nNamely, that it takes time. \n\nIn a world where everyone wants results yesterday, few have the patience and fortitude to keep pressing forward. To learn from their mistakes. To accept the team they have, and make the most of it.\n\nIn years studying successful leaders, athletes, and teams, over and over I find extraordinary stories of resilience. This is so powerful  because we all face situations or circumstances where things don’t go our way, and the default behavior of most is to give up.\n\nBut what those successful people will tell you is that business, sports—even life—is a war of attrition. Meaning, it may seem like everything and everyone is pitted against you. But success only comes after countless mistakes and failures.\n\nThat’s why resilience is so invaluable—because it enables you to stay in the game.\n\nAnd often, the only thing standing between you and success, is the strength to not give up.\n\n***\n\nPS: New Yorkers are resilient, too! This series is far from over.\n\nPPS: What do you think—how important is resilience?

    "Justin Bariso's post 3w ago": "Why is giving negative feedback so stinking hard?\n\nOne huge reason: You were likely never trained *how* to give effective feedback. Or, if you were, the person who trained you probably used one of these methods:\n\n-The (rotten) sandwich method (Praise, negative feedback, praise)\n-Super direct and without care for how the feedback is received\n-Too subtle or wordy, so the point of the feedback is lost\n\nThe problem is, these methods don’t work. But there’s a much better way: \n\nEmotionally intelligent feedback.\n\nEmotionally intelligent feedback is delivering information that can help a person improve in a way they interpret as helpful.\n\nIt follows a 4-step framework:\n\n1. Praise regularly, not just when addressing a problem. \n\nWhen you give your people consistent, sincere, and specific praise, they see you as someone who appreciates them. Then, they'll be more willing to listen when you point out areas for improvement. \n\n2. Give the other person a chance to speak.\n\nBy asking questions like \"How do you feel,\" or \"What challenges are you facing,\" you get the other person's perspective—and that gives you valuable data you can use to tailor the rest of your feedback.\n\n3. Acknowledge, empathize, ask for permission.\n\nBEFORE giving any tips, share a struggle you’ve had in the past, and how someone else’s feedback helped you improve. Doing this builds empathy and connection, and helps the other person to lower their guard.\n\nOnce you’ve done this, you can ask for permission to share something that may help them, too. You could say something like:\n\nCan I share something that’s helped me in the past?\n\n4. Thank the other person for listening.\n\nA simple “thanks for letting me share this” or “hope you find this helpful” goes a long way. In most cases, the person will thank you back.\n\nWant more tips like this?

Not the delivery.\n\nThat's the lesson LeBron James communicated in his post game press conference, when he was asked about Lakers coach J.J. Redick's outburst in the 3rd quarter of last night's playoff game between the Lakers and Timberwolves.\n\nIt's an important lesson because what many people fail to realize is that while one approach is required to DELIVER emotionally intelligent feedback, when you're on the receiving end, you have to take a completely DIFFERENT approach. \n\nNamely, you don't have the luxury of choosing how well the criticism is delivered. You just have to focus on extracting valuable lessons.\n\nI like to compare retrieving value from criticism to cutting and polishing diamonds:\n\nOn the surface, critical feedback is like an ugly piece of rock—nobody wants it. (That’s especially true when the criticism is delivered poorly.) \n\nBut if you train yourself to cut away the ugly exterior, extract the value inside, and then cut and polish, you can end up with a beautiful diamond—a powerful, useful lesson that benefits you.\n\nWhenever you receive negative feedback, try to answer two questions:\n\n-Putting my personal feelings aside, what can I learn from this alternate perspective?\n\n-How can I use this feedback to help me improve?\n\nNow, you change the way you view criticism. \nYou shift your brain from its default mode and exercise control over your response, and your emotions.\nBest of all, you focus on the message, not the delivery...\n\nAnd transform even poorly delivered criticism from an ugly rock to a beautiful diamond.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Do you see value in taking different approaches to giving and receiving criticism?

Doncic, who had made Dallas his home when the Mavericks drafted him at the age of 18, awaited a tribute video the Mavericks had put together to thank him.\n\nThe video started playing on the large screen above. Doncic watched silently.\n\nThen, he wept.\n\n“So many emotions,” Doncic went on to say after the game. “It brought tears to my eyes.”\n\nAlthough he’s played well for the Lakers, Doncic has repeatedly spoken of his struggles leaving the team, the fans, and the city he loved. Somehow, Doncic was able to manage his emotions and put on a basketball masterclass in which he scored 45 points against his former team. \n\nSo, how did he do it?\n\nIn two interviews following the game, a visibly emotional Doncic shared insight into his thoughts and feelings. Interestingly, he kept repeating the same three-word-phrase:\n\n“Everybody had my back.”\n\n“All my teammates had my back. They really supported me.”\n\n“They all had my back. That’s what we talked about before the game and everybody had my back—from coaches to players.”\n\nDid you catch the phrase?

    "Justin Bariso's post 1mo ago": "Saturday night, Houston pulled off one of the most epic late comebacks in March Madness history.\n\nWith just over two minutes to go, the Cougars trailed the Duke Blue Devils by nine points, a score of 55-64. Over those next two minutes, though, the Cougars would go on a remarkable run, ending the game with a victory over Duke with the score of 70-67.\n\nHow'd they do it? How did the Cougars manage the comeback of the year?\n\nI love this 12-word sound bite from Houston Coach Kelvin Sampson:\n\n“No one ever loses at anything as long as you don’t quit.”\n\nFor the past decade, I’ve studied the most successful athletes, coaches, and business leaders to see how successful people use emotional intelligence to reach their goals. In doing so, I’ve seen these successful people display one quality more than any other:\n\nResilience.\n\nResilience is the capacity to withstand or quickly recover from difficulties. It includes two main elements—the abilities to:\n\n-Fight through challenging situations\n-Bounce back from adversity\n\nReslience is so valuable because we all face negative circumstances. A bad game or season. A setback when working on a project, or multiple setbacks. A failed idea, company, or relationship.\n\nSuccessful people face these situations just like everyone, and just like others they suffer through painful feelings and emotions as they do. \n\nBut what sets the most successful people apart is their ability to NOT. STAY. IN. THOSE. EMOTIONS. TOO. LONG.\n\nLike a spring that’s released under pressure, they’re able to bounce back and recover.\n\nThis is exactly what the Cougars did on Saturday.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway for you?\n\nIf you find yourself fighting through a difficult or challenging situation, remind yourself of Sampson’s words:\n\nNo one ever loses at anything as long as you don’t quit.\n\nUse this positive self-expression as motivation and inspiration–to help you build resilience. \n\nBecause the more resilient you become, the more successful you’ll be.\n\n***\n\nWhat about you: Do you think resilience is a major key to success? Why or why not?

    "Justin Bariso's post 2mo ago": "Humility and confidence.\n\nOn the surface, these two qualities seem to be at odds with each other—and they certainly can be. But a game from this weekend's \"March Madness\" tournament shows what can happen when you find the balance between the two.\n\nIn a time out, and down by one with less than four seconds to go, Maryland Terrapins coach Kevin Willard asked his team:\n\n“Who wants the ball?”\n\nWith Willard’s question hanging in the air, Maryland freshman Derik Queen heeded the call.\n\n“Give me the ball,” Queen said.\n\nQueen delivered on his demand. Getting the ball just outside of the three-point line, the freshman drove strong to his left and put up a short jump shot off the glass as the buzzer sounded.\n\nFinal result: Terrapins 72, Rams 71.\n\nThis was more than a great Sunday evening basketball game. It was also a real-time case study in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions to achieve a goal, namely by balancing both humility and confidence.\n\nFor example, consider two lessons:\n\n1. Willard was humble enough to ask his team for their opinion. \n\nIn doing so, he gave them ownership: A decision made together, by a team, will always be supported better than one handed from the top down without any consultation.\n\n2. Queen pushed aside his doubts, stepped up, and showed he was ready for the big stage. \n\nStepping up in this way takes huge confidence. Queen later admitted in the postgame interview that he was a bit nervous, as he had never hit a game winner before.\n\nBut confidence can also work against you, if it’s not kept in balance. \n\nThat’s why it’s so important to see what Queen did after hitting his game winner: He deflected credit for the win away from himself, and instead spoke of the “fight” put up by all his teammates.\n\n“I couldn’t do it without my team,” Queen said.\n\nThat type of humble confidence will go a long way in winning Queen the continued support of his teammates.\n\nThese are just two lessons from this case study in EQ; check out today's column if you want to read the other two!\n\nAnd make sure to share YOUR thoughts down below: Are confidence and humility opposing qualities?

Not only could he no longer hit the strike zone, he struggled to complete a simple throw to his catcher.\n\nI recently spoke with Gessner to learn how he overcame this mental and physical block, and I found his answer surprising:\n\nGessner started journaling.\n\nWhat followed was a slow but steady turnaround.

And through that process often comes new discoveries, unexpected learnings, and true transformation.\n\nA pact should also be a PACT:\n\nPurposeful: It should feel exciting and provide meaning through the learning journey itself.\n\nActionable: It should be based on actions you can reliably perform, and be doable with your current resources.\n\nContinuous: It should be simply and repeatable, whether it’s every day, every weekend, or every week.\n\nTrackable: Not measurable, but trackable with a simple question: Have you done it or not, yes or no?\n\nSome examples from Le Cunff on pacts you can try, or that can inspire you to create your own:\n\nI will code every day for 100 days.\nI will write every weekday for the next six months.\nI will run every Sunday for the next six weeks.\n\nCheck out my column today in Inc. which explains more about why pacts are so valuable, my personal story of how a pact impacted me, and how you can design your own pact.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Do you like the idea of the pact?

    "Justin Bariso's post 2mo ago": "How would you feel if you got \"fired\" from a job that you loved?\n\nThat's basically what happened to basketball superstar Luka Doncic, who the Dallas Mavericks traded to the L.A. Lakers in exchange for former Lakers big man Anthony Davis, in what many have called the most shocking trade in NBA history. Doncic is a generational talent who loved playing in Dallas—and, at 25, likely has not yet hit his prime.\n\nThere have been tons of stories about why Luka got traded, and who won the trade. (Most say L.A. came out the clear winners; others say the trade was good for both teams.) But what has gotten somewhat lost in everything is this:\n\nLuka is hurt. Not physically, but emotionally.\n\nLuka isn't *just* a basketball savant. He's a young man who, like everyone else, has real feelings and emotions. \n\nAnd, according to him, although excited about playing with his hero LeBron James in L.A., Luka got blindsided by this trade, and struggled with leaving Dallas, which he considered \"home.\" \n\nWell, last night the Lakers played the Mavericks, and Doncic and the Lakers came out on top. After the game, it seemed like reporters were all asking Doncic variations on the same question.\n \n“What were the emotions like going into this game?”\n\nDoncic acknowledged this was far from just another game.\n\nHe described it as “weird,” “different,” and said he couldn’t even explain the emotions he was dealing with as he saw close friends, teammates with whom he’s “been through wars together.”\n\nThen, in a few short words, Doncic shared something especially poignant, insightful, and deep.\n\n“The closure is going to take a while, I think,” Doncic replied. “It’s not ideal…There were a lot of emotions, but we go little by little.”\n\n“And every day is better.”\n\nThere’s a great lesson here in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, namely, this: \n\nLosing something important to you hurts. Moving on is a process, and it’s best handled one step at a time.\n\nTo dig deeper into this lesson, and learn more about how to use emotional intelligence to deal with negative emotions, check out today's column.\n\n***\n\nWhat do you think: Have you ever experienced something similar? What did you learn from the experience?\n\nI look forward to reading your comments.\n\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #lakers #mavericks #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 3mo ago": "\"I take all the blame.\"\n\nThat's what Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes said last night after his team lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. It was one of the worst blowouts in Super Bowl history.\n\nAnd it was a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence. Here's why.\n\nMahomes was responsible for his share of mistakes, including two big ones in the second quarter. He threw two interceptions, both which resulted in touchdowns and left the Chiefs trailing the Eagles: 24-0.\n\nAfter the game, Mahomes could have tried to shift the blame. \n\nHe could have talked about how hard it is to complete passes when you’re getting chased by large men who want to punish you like you stole something from them. (The Chiefs offensive line allowed the Eagles to sack Mahomes six times, the most in his career.) \n\nOr, he could have blamed the refs, as he has famously done in the past.\n\nBut he didn’t.\n\n“Credit to the Eagles, man,” Mahomes said in his post game press conference. “They played better than us from start to finish.”\n\n“Obviously the turnovers hurt,” Mahomes continued. “I take all the blame for that...It’s hard to come back from that in a Super Bowl.\"\n\nOver and over, Mahomes put the blame on himself.\n\n“I can’t turn the ball over early in the game when it’s not going our way,” Mahomes said.\n\n“I’ll have to learn from that and try to be better the next opportunity that I hopefully get,” Mahomes said.\n\n“Hopefully we can learn from this…and try to continue to get even better because it’s going to take better football, especially from me in order to try to make a run at another Super Bowl,” Mahomes said.\n\nWith these words, Mahomes did more than take ownership of the loss. He taught a brilliant lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nWhy are Mahomes' comments so remarkable? And what can you learn from them that will help you in business and life? \n\nCheck out the answers in today's column. (Link in the comments.)\n\n***\n\nWhat do YOU think: When you play the blame game, you're the only one who loses.

    "Justin Bariso's post 3mo ago": "Starbucks is using an amazing new ad—and free coffee—to give a master class in emotional intelligence.\n\nHere's the story:\n\nYesterday, Starbucks revealed its new Super Bowl Ad—and a new promotion that's sure to get people talking.\n\nThe 60-second ad, “Hello Again,” will actually run just before the big game. It'll be followed by another ad post-game, informing Starbucks Rewards members that they can get a free tall iced or hot coffee on the following day (Monday).\n\nThat’s all great news if you’re a Starbucks fan. \n\nBut let’s say you’ve never been a Starbucks fan…or, that you’re one of the many former fans who feel the coffee company lost its way over the years.\n\nWell, there’s a good chance this new ad will speak to you.\n\nThe ad is set to the song “Thunderstruck” by rock group AC/DC.\n\nIt opens with a Starbucks barista opening a store in early morning darkness...\n\nBaristas smile, laugh, and dance as they work. \n\nCustomers smile and dance with their kids as they pick up their orders. \n\nThe message of the ad is short and punchy. The voiceover artist’s delivery is poetic.\n\nThe whole thing is quite…emotional. \n\nStrike that. \n\nIt’s emotionally intelligent.\n\nEmotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Like general intelligence, emotional intelligence is often thought of in terms of solving a problem or achieving a goal.\n\nThat’s what makes this ad so great.\n\nIt’s designed, not so much to inform, but to touch you on an emotional level. \n\nStarbucks wants to remind you of who it once was, why its customers skyrocketed them from another small coffee chain to the biggest coffeehouse on the planet.\n\nIt wants to make you feel good about Starbucks, so that you’re ready to give it a shot. Or, another shot, depending on your experience with the brand. And they’re making it as easy as possible to do by giving away free coffee.\n\nThe goal? If you watch the ad and come in for a coffee, you’ll either create or rekindle a positive relationship with Starbucks.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway for you?\n\nIf you run a company or a marketing team, it’s easy to get lost in the complexity of communicating many things. \n\nInterestingly, though, Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks' Global Chief Brand Officer, says the new Starbucks ad started with a simple directive: \n\n“Celebrate what makes Starbucks, Starbucks.”\n\nSimple is best: Focus on how you make the customer feel. \n\nThen, give them a chance to build on that experience.\n\nDo this right, and you’ll inspire new and former customers alike to give you a shot. \n\nAnd if you deliver on your promise, you’ll be building a brand that customers love.\n\n(Check out today's column in the comments.)\n\n***\n\nAre you a current or former Starbucks fan? Would this ad make you give the brand another shot?\n\nI look forward to reading your comments.\n\n#starbucks #marketing #emotionalintelligence #leadership #management #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

A few minutes earlier I had walked into Starbucks and ordered a Brown Sugar Oat Milk Cortado, my new go-to drink. I thought I had indicated I wanted the drink for here, as I was planning to get some work done over the next few hours and wanted a nice mug to sip from.\n\n But as I got the drink in a “to-go” cup, it became obvious there was a miscommunication.\n\n“Umm, if possible,” I replied.\n\nThe barista let out a silent sigh. I felt bad to make her redo the drink. On the other hand, I had just paid $5 for a coffee. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the interaction left both of us with a bitter taste in our mouths.\n \nWell, it looks like Starbucks is trying to fix that.\n\nHere’s what the company recently announced on its company website:\n\n“Starting January 27, when you order any beverage ‘for here’ it will be served in a coffee mug, glass, or in your clean personal cup brought from home. During your visit to that cafe, you will also be able to enjoy free refills of hot brewed or iced coffee, or hot or iced tea.”\n\nCeramic mugs and free refills? Sign me up.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a small change. But let me assure you, it’s not—and the reasons why are about much more than trying to reduce waste.

    "Justin Bariso's post 4mo ago": "Are you using positive self-talk to will big moments into existence? \n\nIf not, you might want to take a lesson from Philadelphia Eagles Running Back Saquon Barkley.\n\nYesterday, the Eagles punched their ticket to next week’s NFC Championship Game. A big part of the win was the performance of Eagles Running Back Saquon Barkley, who rushed for 205 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAfter the game, a reporter asked Barkley about a key play, a 4th quarter, 78-yard touchdown run through falling snow that put the Eagles up for good.\n\n“Before, I closed my eyes and talked to Jody our therapist, kind of got in my own little mantra,” Barkley replied. “It’s cool when you work on exercises like that. Tell yourself, this is the moment, and it happens.”\n\nWith this statement, Barkley reveals a secret emotionally intelligent technique that high performers use to motivate themselves and increase performance. In psychology, this technique is known as “positive self-talk.”\n\nBy developing short, encouraging phrases to be used in the moment, you can positively influence the way you think, feel, and act. \n\nFor example, in my emotional intelligence practice I teach clients to use the following phrases:\n\n-“Use the difficulty” (to overcome adversity)\n-“Work in progress” (to beat perfectionism)\n-“Run the experiment” (to stop overthinking and move forward)\n-“They don’t know” (to ignore hurtful comments and avoid distraction)\n-“Seek discomfort” (to build mental strength and resilience)\n\nWant to learn more about the benefits of positive self-talk and how to use it?

Besides the fact that it's hilarious,  touching, and extremely realistic, I often use episodes to teach emotional intelligence lessons. (Before last year's season finale, my favorite was \"Bike.\" IYKYK.)\n\nThis news was bittersweet, though. Although Bluey creator Joe Brumm will be heavily involved in the film, he said he's actually stepping away from the series for the time being. \n\nIn other words: No new Bluey episodes anytime soon.\n\nWhy is that? As Brumm explained in an open letter:\n\n“I always said I wouldn’t keep making the show if I thought I couldn’t make any new season as good as the last,” Brumm wrote. “This would have been the case for me with a potential season four, so I’ve decided to take a break from my involvement in the TV series. In the event I can’t wrap my head around doing more seasons myself, 'The Sign' will mark my TV finale for Bluey and I wrote it as such.”\n\n(BTW, If you haven't see \"The Sign,\" I highly recommend you watch. It's a master class in storytelling, and literally a perfect episode.)\n\nBrumm says that walking away from the series at its height “will seem crazy to some.” But he added that he was finding it difficult to continue to write authentically in the “four to six year old world.”\n\nIf you run a creator business, there's a huge lesson here if your tank runs dry, if the ideas aren’t coming as quickly as they used to, or if, like Brumm, your work isn’t reaching the quality you want.\n\nWhen that time comes, consider keeping the fire alive by:\n\n-Taking a break\n-Working on other projects for a while\n-Changing something about your work (the format, the platform, the audience)\n\nDoing so can help breathe new life into your work.\n\nAnd while I'll miss 'Bluey' the show, I can't wait to see what's next.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n💬 Comment and share your thoughts\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more EQ tips & tools\n\n#emotionalintelligence #productivity #creativity #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Once it’s gone, it’s gone.\n\nResearch shows that when you take time for others, everyone benefits.\n\nFor example, Gallup discovered that employees whose managers held regular meetings with them were almost three times as likely to be engaged at work than counterparts who had no regular meetings. (Employees who had daily communication with their managers were most engaged.)\n\nOf course, this type of investment takes time. But it’s time well spent.\n\nWhat about our personal lives?\n\nIn a study conducted by psychologists at the University of Zurich, participants were assigned to meet up with three people they cared about in the course of a week, to give them a “gift of time.” (The gift needed to be more than the time they would normally spend with each person). \n\nWhen compared with another group who wrote about their memories in a daily journal, the “time-givers” reported greater happiness. The longer they continued the practice, the more happiness they reported.\n\nSo, this week, why don’t you plan your own gift of time? \n\nSimply:\n\n1️⃣ Pick a person you’d like to give some time to; then\n2️⃣ Plan to do something with that person.\n\nIt could be:\n\n💡 Inviting someone for a meal, or even just for ☕ \n👋 A surprise visit\n☀️ Meeting for a walk outside\n🖥️ A virtual call \n🥳 A morning or afternoon off to spend together\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind...\n\nYou hardly remember the time you spend alone. But you definitely remember the time you spend with others. \n\nMeaning, by simply sharing your time with others, you make an investment:\n\nYou’re creating memories for the future.\n\nSo, remember:\n\nTime is the most precious resource you have. Spend it wisely by sharing it with others.\n\nBecause once time is gone, you’re never getting it back.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n💬 Comment and share your thoughts\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more emotional intelligence tips & tools\n\nThanks to the very talented Roberto Ferraro for the image!\n\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 5mo ago": "Ever feel stuck and unable to make a decision or move forward?\n\nHere's a brilliant 3-word phrase that'll help you make quicker, better decisions:\n\n\"Run the experiment.\"\n\nWhy is this phrase so helpful?\n\nFirst of all, it’s important to remember that thinking is not the same as OVER-thinking. Thinking things through is good.\n\nBut overthinking is bad because:\n\n-Life rarely plays out exactly the way you’ve imagined it. \n\n-You spend hours, days, even months or years worrying about things that will never happen.\n\n-It paralyzes you and prevents you from moving forward.\n\nIn contrast, when you run the experiment, you take this approach:\n\n\"I'm not sure of the right way. But I won't know unless I make a decision.\n\n\"So, let's pick one. If it works out great, awesome. If not, I'll have more data and can adjust—or, will know what to do next time.\"\n\nThere are very few irreversible decisions. When you run the experiment, you choose to move forward, rather than standing still. \n\nAnd since time is money, standing still often costs more than changing your mind.\n\nAs you run more and more experiments, you'll get into a repeated cycle of:\n\n-think\n-decide\n-test\n-learn\n-adjust\n\nThat tight feedback loop will help you make better and better decisions over time.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself overthinking, take a step back and...\n\nRun the experiment.\n\nBecause the more experiments you run, the better decisions you’ll make.\n\n***\n\n♻️ Repost if you found this helpful\n➡️ Follow Justin Bariso for more emotional intelligence tools\n\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Someone unique, someone who would stand out. But Miyamoto was limited by game hardware and software at the time.\n\nTo make this small character look more human, Miyamoto gave him a big nose. He added a mustache so there was no need to draw a mouth or show facial expressions, and a hat so the character’s hair wouldn’t need to be animated when he jumped. The high contrast red overalls and blue shirt completed the look.\n\nYes—Mario, the most famous video game character of all time, was the product of working within constraints.\n\nThis teaches a great lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions:\n\nConstraints, while limiting, can breed innovation—if you change the way you view them.\n\nCheck out more examples, and how you can change the way YOU view constraints, in today's column. (It's in the comments.)\n\n***\n\nWhat about you: Have constraints helped you do better work? Look forward to reading your thoughts and stories in the comments.

But it's close. \n\nWhat's the trick?\n\nWriting by hand.\n\nWhen you write by hand (journal), you're forced to slow down and think about what you're writing. Research shows this promotes more elaborate brain connectivity, which is crucial for memory formation, encoding new information, and learning.\n\nIn other words, the process of writing not only allows you to clarify thoughts, it helps you “internalize” them—making them a part of you.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t happen instantaneously as in the movies. \n\nBut over time you'll find journaling like this helps you remember and practice what you learn. \n\nYes, it takes time and repeated practice to see the benefits. But the good news? It only takes a few minutes a day to see benefits.\n\nTry it out!\n\n***\n\nHave you experienced the benefits of handwriting and journaling?

    "Justin Bariso's post 5mo ago": "Is empathy good or bad? \n\nThe answer may surprise you.\n\nI’ve been told I’m a very empathetic person. I always considered that a strength...\n\nAnd it is, if kept in balance.\n\nDon't get me wrong—I think we need more empathy in the world. Empathy helps us to understand and relate to others.\n\nBut here's the thing: If you leave your empathy unchecked, it'll take a heavy toll. That's because you can't really turn empathy \"off.\" \n\nWhen others pour out their hearts to me, I take it all in. Unable to turn off my feelings, I’m often left feeling emotionally drained. And I'm not alone.\n\nResearch shows that nurses who work with terminally ill patients run a high risk of developing \"compassion fatigue,\" a condition of physical and emotional depletion. It’s easy for caregivers like these to focus on the needs of their patients at the expense of their own, putting them on a path to burnout.\n\nWe can compare empathy to a muscle. Used in the right way, it allows you to “lift” others up and even help carry their burdens. But like any muscle, it can become overworked.\n\nThe key, then, is to develop emotionally intelligent empathy—balanced empathy that works for you, instead of against you.\n\nHow can you exercise your empathy muscle in an emotionally intelligent way?\n\nA few tips: \n\n1. Give yourself buffer time.\nIf your job involves being around others much of the day, you may quickly find yourself emotionally exhausted.\n\nTo combat this, schedule buffer time between meetings or time with others. Take shorter, more frequent breaks that allow you to recharge your emotional batteries.\n\n2. Set boundaries.\nIf you're spending time with someone who you know needs more than usual attention, set a time limit. You might even make an appointment that you have to meet at a certain time—even if it's an appointment with yourself.\n\nOf course, you don't want to rush away...but recognize that if every time you're with them you overspend your emotional budget, you'll probably start avoiding them altogether.\n\nYour empathy muscle can be a major source of strength—but only if you don’t work it to the point of breakdown.\n\nSo, work to understand your own emotional needs; then, act accordingly. \n\nThat's that's emotionally intelligent empathy—empathy that helpful, instead of harmful.\n\n***\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever overworked your empathy muscle? I look forward to reading your comments.\n\n\n#emotionalintelligence #mentalhealth #management #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 5mo ago": "Embarrassing.\n\nThat's the word (in one form or another) Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, Lakers head coach J.J. Redick, and Lakers legend Magic Johnson used to describe the team's two recent blowout losses.\n\nWhich brings us to a question: \n\nHow do YOU deal with embarrassment?\n\nOf course, nobody likes to experience negative emotions like embarrassment...but they can be useful if you channel them the right way.\n\nAs Redick correctly identified in his postgame press conference, the tendency after a couple of losses like this is for the team to splinter, to start going through the motions. They might just show up for work, rather than continue to strive to work together as a team, with a shared vision and shared goals. \n\nRedick’s job is to identify how to make it the latter, rather than the former.\n\nWhat's the takeaway for you? \n\nWhen you suffer embarrassment, accept it. Process it. Then, use that negative feeling to motivate you to action: to identify what factors led to the embarrassment, to develop a plan to deal with those factors, and then to start working to implement that plan. \n\nI'm personally hopeful Redick will figure it out, as I'm a fan of his approach to the game. After all, it's a long season...and the team's just getting started.\n\n\nWhat do YOU think? \n\nCan embarrassment ever be a good thing? If so, how can you leverage it for a positive result?

You also must make sure everyone's voice is heard.\n\nAt some point, though, the time comes to make a decision. When that happens, if things don't go your way, can you disagree and commit? No silent sabotage (or public sabotage, for that matter), no passive-aggressive lack of support, no complaining or murmuring that \"I know this isn't going to work.\" Instead, you go all in and try to make the decision a success.\n\nSome people think this is unrealistic, and doesn't work in the real world.

Instead of offering discounts, the company has been offering more bonuses, like extra loyalty points. Additionally, in a recent strategy update, Starbucks told store leaders it will now focus on promoting seasonal drinks (think of the ubiquitous “Pumpkin Spice Latte”).\n\nThis change in strategy is brilliant for several reasons, including the following:\n\n1. You just don’t discount premium.\n2. You have to reward your most loyal customers.\n3. Deadlines increase urgency (and sales).\n\nThis strategy  shows evidence of Niccol’s business acumen, who's a rockstar in the restaurant industry.\n\nOf course, depending on which type of Starbucks customer you are, you’ll either love or hate this change. \n\n(For the full story, check out today's column.)\n\n#starbucks #leadership #management #strategy #branding #brianniccol",

I reached out to professional lip reader Nicola HICKLING, founder of LipReader. According to Hickling, it appears Lamb is saying: “Some ball control, come on.”\n\nOther online sleuths, though, thought Lamb was trying to encourage Prescott, saying: “Jump balls four. Jump balls, I got you.” (“Four” is Prescott’s jersey number.)\n\nRegardless of what Lamb really said, Prescott’s reply was brilliant: He simply looked down at the field in silence.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nBoth teams exchanged leads as the game went on. But on the Cowboys final play, 4th down and goal with less than 30 seconds to go, Prescott delivered a perfect touchdown pass.\n\nIt turned out to be the game winner.\n\nFor some, Prescott’s silence earlier in the game may not seem like much.

There's a lot of wisdom in it.\n\nIt shows the value of looking to the past to learn from mistakes—both our own, and those of others.\n\nBut it also emphasizes that you can't get stuck in the past. Rather, each day brings with it new opportunities. \n\nEmotional intelligence (EQ), the ability to understand and manage emotions, includes learning how to not get caught up in the moment, which can lead to us make an emotional decision we later regret.\n\nBut emotional intelligence ALSO involves being able to tap into your emotions—to leverage your feelings, learn from the past, and apply those learnings to the future.\n\nSo, ask yourself:\n\n-What can I learn from MY past?\n-What mistakes am I repeating over and over, without even thinking?\n-What am I doing now that I'll regret if I don't change?\n-What am I NOT doing now, that I really want to start?\n\nThe answers can help you start to make emotions work for you, not against you.\n\nAnd that's emotional intelligence at its best.\n\n#leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 8mo ago": "Starbucks' board of directors was worried.\n\nSales at the world's largest coffee company were slipping. An activist investor was clamoring for change. And Starbucks founder and former CEO Howard Schultz wasn't happy, sharing his displeasure in an open letter on LinkedIn criticizing the company's direction and leadership.\n\nSo, in July, the board started a conversation about a potential change in leadership. Soon after this, Hobson says she reached out to Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol through a third party.\n\n\"We thought we had the opportunity to engage with one of the biggest names in the industry,\" Hobson told CNBC. \"He knows this industry, and we thought he would be the right leader for this moment.\"\n\nNiccol took the call. And Hobson says she clearly remembers what Niccol told her when they spoke.\n\n\"I know what to do,\" Hobson says Niccol told him. \"This is a speed bump in this company's history. This is not something I fear going into.\"\n\n\"I know what to do.\"\n\nThose five words aren't just confident, they're emotionally intelligent—because they helped convince Hobson, and likely Starbucks' board, that Niccol was the right person for the job. The biggest reason why? Because Niccol had the track record to back his words up.\n\n(Read more about what convinced Starbucks to hire its new CEO—and how to build your own emotional intelligence—in today's column on Inc.)\n\n#starbucks #leadership #management #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Hurley is the head coach of the University of Connecticut Huskies, where he's led his last two teams to national championships. Because of his resume, his sophisticated play calling, and his reputation as a motivator, Hurley is regarded by many as the best coach in college basketball.\n\nHurley has stated his desire to one day coach in the NBA. So, you can imagine how he felt when the Lakers, one of the league's most storied franchises and the team of superstar LeBron James, began pursuing him as their next head coach. The Lakers reportedly offered Hurley a six-year contract worth $70 million, more than double his current contract with the University of Connecticut, which is reportedly worth $32.1 million, before incentives.\n\nYesterday, though, Hurley released a statement indicating he would be turning down the Lakers and staying with the Huskies.\n\nThere is a lesson here in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nThe lesson, tough, lies not in the decision itself. It's in the process Hurley used to make the decision, namely, that he took the time he needed--no more, no less.\n\nWhy is this lesson so important?

A big part of that success is due to the play of Celtics superstar Jayson Taytum; interestingly, though, Taytum’s scoring is down significantly. \n\nIn the regular season, Taytum averaged almost 27 points per game; in these first two games of the finals, he’s scored 16 and 18 points, respectively. But Taytum is doing other things his team may need even more: His assists and rebounds, for example, are up from his season averages.\n\nIn last night’s postgame press conference, a reporter asked Taytum about this change. His answer was insightful.\n\n“I’ve been here before [in the finals] and we didn’t win,” Taytum replied. “We’re so close to what we’re trying to accomplish. Why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points get in the way of that?”\n\nTaytum continued:\n\n“We always talk about, ‘do whatever it takes, for however long it takes.’ And if I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that’s what puts us in the best position to win…sign me up.”\n\nDo whatever it takes, for however long it takes.\n\nThis nine word philosophy is much more than a great sound bite, it’s a lesson in emotionally intelligent leadership. But to truly understand why, it helps to know some of the backstory behind Taytum’s comments.\n\nWhat events have led up to the Celtics current success? And how can the Celtics’ philosophy help you be a more emotionally intelligent leader?\n\nRead more in today's column.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eb6F-thj\n\n#leadership #management #EmotionalIntelligence #boston #celtics #NBA #NBAfinals #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Afterwards, Carter marched straight up to Clark, yelled, and laid her shoulder into her, sending Clark flying.\n\nCarter refused to answer any questions after the game about why she did what she did (or questions about Clark at all, for that matter). But in a post on social media platform “X,” Carter referenced what happened on the previous play, in which Clark slapps the ball away from Carter and then appears to yell at her afterwards.\n\nClark, on the other hand, did address the play.\n\n“I wasn’t expecting that,” Clark said after the game. “But I think it’s just like, ‘Respond, calm down, and let your play do the talking.’”\n\nRespond, calm down, and let your play do the talking.\n\nThat’s exactly what Clark did. Following the foul, she was able to sink the corresponding free throw. And that one point ended up being exactly what the Fever needed to defeat the Sky, 71-70.\n\nClark’s 10-word reply is more than a great sound bite, it’s a mini master class in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from Clark’s reply?

Although the caller ID didn’t show a number, Gifford says she was certain it was Stern. She didn’t answer but Stern left a powerful message.\n\n“He was basically saying ‘I can’t believe how nice you were to me,’” Gifford relates. “’I just need to apologize to you. Please call me.’”\n\nIn a separate interview several years ago, Gifford said Stern told her he was angry at her because “you were everything I wasn’t.”\n\nBut there’s more to this story. It turns out, that day in the Today show studio wasn’t the first time Gifford reached out to Stern.\n\nAs we dive in deeper, let’s examine why Gifford’s actions teach a master class in emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to break down barriers and manage the emotions of others. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#leadership #management #EmotionalIntelligence #communication #persuasion #conflictmanagement #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

The 3-Question Rule\n\nYears ago I was watching an interview with comedian Craig Ferguson. He made a funny but very insightful joke:\n\nThere are three things you must always ask yourself before you say anything:\n\n-Does this need to be said?\n-Does this need to be said by me?\n-Does this need to be said by me, now?\n\nFerguson quipped it took him three marriages to learn this lesson. \n\nBut all joking aside, I use this rule every day, and it's saved me more times than I can count.\n\n2. The Blue Dolphin Rule\n\nThe Blue Dolphin Rule is a solution to the \"White Bear Problem,\" also known as ironic process theory. \n\nThe problem was developed by Harvard psychologist Daniel Wegner and refers to a quote by Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky:\n\n\"Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute.\"\n\nOver time, psychologists identified one of the most effective solutions to the white bear problem was to replace unwanted thoughts with desired thoughts. \n\nI call these desired thoughts \"Blue Dolphins.\"\n\nFor example, if you're getting nervous before a big presentation, you can replace disquieting thoughts with a more encouraging one: \n\nWhite Bear: \"I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous. I'm so nervous.\"\n\nBlue Dolphin: \"I'm so excited. I've prepared well. This is going to go great.\"\n\n3. The Golden Question\n\nThe golden question is actually five questions in one. \n\nWhen you need to make a decision under pressure or stress, ask yourself:\n\nHow will I feel about this in:\n\n-a day?\n-a week?\n-a month?\n-a year?\n-5 years?\n\nThe Golden Question helps you keep things in perspective. AND it gives you a glimpse into the future—so you make better, more well-rounded decisions you don't later regret.\n\nWould you like 21 more frameworks like these? \n\nWant to drastically improve your emotional intelligence in just 24 days?\n\nFor the next 7 days, my course \"The Rules of Emotional Intelligence\" is on sale for $49 (normally $199).\n\nGet lifetime access to the psychology-based frameworks that have transformed my life—and that I've taught to thousands of persons across the world, including top executives, CEOs, coaches, and therapists. \n\nUse coupon code EQSPRING24 to get the discount. \n\nYou can learn more about the course here: \nhttps://lnkd.in/epWuYgRz",

Some were short, a minute or less. Others were not so short, even reaching up to five minutes--or longer.\n\nRecently, it seems this practice is going mainstream in the U.S. \"Burned out on screens, people are sending lengthy voice notes instead,\" reported the Washington Post last week. And this morning LinkedIn published a short article on \"The rise of the voice memo.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I used to hate on these types of messages. But over time, my opinion changed.\n \nPart of the reason for this is my work. As an emotional intelligence coach, I've spent thousands of hours researching, practicing, and helping others to better understand and manage their emotions. In doing so, I've grown to appreciate the value of voice messages.\n\nWhat advantages do voice messages offer over written messages, or phone or virtual calls?

    "Justin Bariso's post 11mo ago": "Remember in Spider-Man, when Peter Parker first discovered his super powers, but didn't know how to control them? He tried climbing and swinging between buildings, and fell flat on his face.\n\nOr how about in the story of Superman, when Clark Kent discovered X-ray vision and super-hearing for the first time--and got completely disoriented. \nIt's similar when building emotional intelligence.\n\nEmotions are powerful. Anger, sadness, and fear are all powerful emotions that can lead us to say or do things we later regret. Even so called positive emotions, like joy, can lead to regret if it causes us to agree to something because we're in a good mood, only to realize later we've over committed.\n\nBut those same emotions can be a force for good.\n\nFear can be paralyzing, but it can also motivate us to get away from a dangerous situation. \n\nSadness is painful, but it can help us to realign our priorities or to take action. \nAnd while a bad temper can ruin a relationship, controlled anger, displayed in the proper degree and in the right way, can inspire needed change.\n\nThat's why, once you start to develop it, you know: Emotional intelligence is a superpower.\n\nIn studying emotional intelligence for over a decade, I've seen firsthand how this ability gives persons a powerful edge. We could sum up the reason why in just seven words:\n\nEmotional Intelligence helps you see things differently.\n\nHow does emotional intelligence give you a different perspective from the rest of the world? Here are a few examples.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#leadership #management #EmotionalIntelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "Last Sunday evening, Dallas Mavericks star point guard Kyrie Irving was relaxing at home with his family. He had just watched the Minnesota Timberwolves defeat the Denver Nuggets in a grueling, seven game playoff series, earning the Timberwolves a spot in the NBA's Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe Timberwolves would be playing against Irving and the Mavericks. So, when Minnesota star player Anthony Edwards' was asked for his opinion on the upcoming series, Irving was all ears.\n\n\"My matchup [is] going to be Kyrie,\" Edwards said. \"So that's going to be fun. We're going to see what I can do versus him.\"\n\nOn the surface, these comments sound innocent. But they made up a soundbite that was the talk of the town in sports media and basketball circles over the next days. Many felt that the young but talented superstar Edwards was calling out the veteran Irving, implying he would limit Irving's effectiveness on the court.\n\nIrving's reply was, well...perfect.\n\nIn game one of the Western Conference Finals, Irving put on a masterful performance. His 30 points proved key to the underdog Mavericks defeating the Timberwolves.\n\nAfter the game, Irving was asked about Edwards comments.\n\n\"[I] used it as a motivation,\" Irving said. \"When I was sitting at home and I saw it, I was like, it's just a nod of respect...But also, that's a no-fear mentality, and that's why we love [Anthony Edwards].\"\n\nIrving's comments teach a master class in emotional intelligence, namely, in how to avoid taking offense in the comments of others, while still using those comments to provide motivation and focus.\n\nWhat are the biggest takeaways from Irving's response? And how can you apply them to your business and personal life?

Jassy loved his role at Amazon, which had included running several areas of the company, including AWS (Amazon Web Services, the company's successful cloud computing division). He knew Bezos would be leaving big shoes to fill.\n\n\"I really wasn't thinking about that role,\" Jassy said. \"I was surprised and I was flattered, and I said, well, if it's ok I'd like to talk to my wife about it.\"\n\nJassy went on to relate that his wife and he spoke about the job offer over dinner. Most of the conversation that night consisted of his wife asking him deep, soul-searching questions, a few of which included:\n\n-Why do you want to do this job?\n-You love your current job...Do you feel you're done with it?\n-Are you sure?\n\nJassy says he didn't realize it at the time, but that conversation led him to a major discovery: He was ready for a different challenge. \n\nSoon after, he accepted the job.\n\nBoth Jassy and his wife's actions teach powerful lessons in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Let's break down three valuable takeaways from this story and see how you can apply them to your own business. \n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#amazon #management #emotionalintelligence #AndyJassy #linkedin #ryanroslansky #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

It was a Saturday night, but he was just hanging around the house, not doing anything special.\n\n\"Oh, man,\" he sighed. \"Do I have to? I just want to chill.\"\n\nI was silent. I wanted to be balanced...But I also wanted the two of us to spend time together. I took a few minutes to think. Suddenly, I had an epiphany.\n\n\"Yeah, you have to,\" I said. \"Come on, let's go.\"\n\nYou can imagine his mood when I forced him to come. But that mood would change when I shared the reason behind my decision.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said to my son. \"You know why I didn't let you stay at home?\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of this number,\" I replied.\n\nI showed him the calculator on my phone, which showed a seemingly random figure:\n\n364.\n\n\"Is that a big number?\" I asked my son.\n\n\"Well, it's one day short of a year,\" he replied.\n\n\"Yeah, that's true,\" I said. \"But there's something else.\"\n\nI sat for a minute, letting the silence settle in.\n\n\"That's very possibly the number of weekends we have left together,\" I said.\n\n\"You're about to be a teenager,\" I explained. \"Which means you've probably lived longer with your mom and I than you'll still live with us. I mean, who knows, right? If you leave home around the time that I did, that's about what we've got left.\"\n\n\"I want to spend as much time with you as I can,\" I continued. \"Because there's nothing I enjoy more than spending time with you and your sisters.\"\n\nIt took a while, but eventually my son cheered up. The evening was amazing: We talked, we laughed, we had a great time.\n\nThis story illustrates how to use a powerful tool of emotional intelligence, something I call the \"Calendar Rule.\"\n\nWhat exactly is the Calendar Rule?

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "When it comes to leading Starbucks, Howard Schultz has always left big shoes to fill.\n\nThe former Starbucks CEO published a LinkedIn post yesterday, calling out the company's poor performance and pointing out how to fix it. Schultz says leaders need to \"model both humility and confidence,\" as they strive to restore trust and increase performance.\n\nBut take a moment to look beyond Schultz's analysis. Focus on the way he speaks about the brand, and a key insight emerges. \n\nFor example, see if you can identify just one word that stands out in the middle of Schultz's post. After highlighting that he no longer serves on the company's board of directors, and has had no formal role in Starbucks since last year, Schultz says the following:\n\n\"But my love of the company and all those who wear 'the cloth of the company'—the iconic green apron—knows no bounds.\"\n\nDid you catch the key word?\n\nLove.\n\nThere's no doubt Schultz truly loves Starbucks. The problem, though, is Starbucks continues to bring in outsiders to lead—and there's no way they can love Starbucks the way Schultz wants them to. \n\nThe lesson has to do with emotional intelligence, namely this: Starbucks needs more than a leader who knows how to run a global company.\n\nThey need a leader who truly loves Starbucks.\n\nTo prove this, let's dive into Starbucks' history. Then, we'll analyze the takeaway and see how you can apply it to your own business.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n\n#starbucks #management #emotionalintelligence #leadership #HowardSchultz #LinkedIn #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Cuban is arguably Shark Tank's most popular star, and he's invested in hundreds of companies over the years. Why stop now?\n\nSo, I reached out to Cuban over email to ask him. His reply:\n\n\"[Shark Tank] shoots in the summer and I want to spend that time with family before my kids are off on their own,\" Cuban told me. \n\nI can relate to this.\n\nA few months ago, I had an epiphany: My oldest son is about to become a teenager. Meaning, that my wife and I have already spent more time living with him than we will without him—as he too will likely leave home in just over a few more years.\n\nYes, when running a business there's always more work to do. Questions to answer, emails to write, deals to close. But you know what won't always be there, at least, not right in front of me?\n\nMy kids.\n\nConstantly reminding myself of these facts allows me to use them as a filter for my decision making. \n\nYes, I enjoy my work. But the goal of the business is not to grow as large as possible, or to make as much money as I can. The goal is to give me the freedom to pursue other interests that are even more important—like spending time with my family. \n\nHow can you apply this lesson to your own work life, regardless of whether or not you have a family?\n\nCheck out the three questions you can ask yourself in today's column.\n\n(Make sure to follow for more lessons like this one, which I drop once or twice a week!)\n\n#management #SharkTank #EmotionalIntelligence #MarkCuban #leadership #productivity #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou\n\n***",

This despite the fact that we just returned from vacation...and we have out of town guests coming...and the work was piling up.\n\nBut I knew pushing work aside for a few hours to spend time with my girls was a decision I wouldn't regret.\n\nAnd it's a privilege I'm thankful for.\n\nIn the past, people often started working for themselves because it was in their blood to start a business. Or, they wanted to make more money, despite the grueling schedule it often took to do so.\n\nBut over time, the reason many persons pursue entrepreneurship and solopreneurship has shifted:\n\nMany of us work for ourselves, not to earn more or accomplish more from a professional perspective.\n\nRather, we work for ourselves for the freedom it provides.\n\nFreedom to pursue our passions.\n\nFreedom to take a long lunch break, or go on a walk, or take an afternoon nap when we feel like it.\n\nFreedom to break free for a game of basketball...Or, yes, freedom to watch the season finale of Bluey with my girls as soon as possible.\n\nTruth be told, I never planned on starting a business.

You're at the absolute emotional climax as Joel plays the final song of his set, his most famous: Piano Man.\n\nThen, as you're singing along, right in the middle of the song...\n\nThe screen suddenly fades to black, followed by the beginning of the nightly news.\n\nThat's apparently what happened to countless viewers across the eastern and central parts of the U.S. on Sunday night. Apparently, there was a special report after the Masters that \"wasn't accounted for by the powers that be,\" according to Evan Closky, Sports Director for CBS affiliate 10 Tampa Bay.\n\nImmediately, Billy Joel fans took to social media to blast the network. \"Evidently, CBS was no longer in the mood for a melody,\" wrote sports media news site Awful Announcing on X.\n\nThe worst part of this debacle, though, was what happened next.

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "\"All I have to say is, the revenge tour is over.\"\n\nThat's what South Carolina point guard Raven Johnson said on the podium yesterday, after the South Carolina Gamecocks defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes for the Women's Basketball NCAA National Championship. The victory was especially sweet, considering Iowa and its star Caitlin Clark ousted South Carolina in last year's Final Four.\n\nBut there's a bit more to this story.\n\nYou might remember a viral moment from last year's Iowa-South Carolina game: At one point, Clark refused to guard Johnson from behind the three point arc. Clark even looked away from Johnson, making a hand gesture that in basketball culture is basically sign language for, \"I'm not worried about you making a shot from out there.\"\n\nAn embarrassing moment like that could destroy a player's confidence. But Johnson didn't allow that to happen. Instead, she used the moment as motivation.\n\n\"What happened last year was the best thing that happened to me because I got in the gym and worked on my weakness,\" Johnson said in a recent interview. \"I think it put a chip on my shoulder to just get in the gym and get better. Improve on my game, improve on who I am.\"\n\nBeyond that, though, it also inspired Johnson to double down on her ability to defend Clark.\n\nLast year, Clark torched South Carolina for 41 points. At the beginning of yesterday's game, it looked like she was on pace to better that, as she scored 18 points in the first quarter alone.\n\nThen, Johnson stepped in.\n\n\"When the game started, they started with a 20 point lead,\" Johnson said. \"I was asking coach, like, 'let me get her, let me get her.'\"\n\nJohnson said that she took what happened last year personally. That motivated her to take 200 three point shots a day in practice. It also moved her to watch film of Clark, studying her moves.\n\n\"I was ready for her,\" said Johnson.\n\nAnd ready she was. Clark clearly struggled as Johnson served as her primary defender for the rest of the game, scoring only 12 more points with an inefficient shot completion of 10 for 28. Additionally, Johnson tallied two blocks and four steals, including a clean pick of Clark's pocket that led to a layup putting the Gamecocks up by three to end the half.\n\nI've studied countless elite athletes and businesspeople over the years, and when it comes to mastering emotions and leveraging them to your advantage, one lesson keeps coming out loud and clear:\n\nEmotionally intelligent people experience negative emotions like everyone else. What sets them apart is their ability to bounce back from those emotions, and turn negative feelings into a catalyst for positive results.\n\n(Read more examples of this vital lesson in today's column.)\n\n#FinalFour #management #EmotionalIntelligence #ncaa #basketball #resilience #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

But the study is interesting because it was inspired by the Yerkes-Dodson Law, a little known law of psychology designed to model the relationship between stress and behavior, developed over a hundred years ago.\n\nAnd while this study is new with a small sample size, it actually builds on previous neuroscience research that analyzed the influence of background music on participants' emotions and performance.\n\nWhat is the Yerkes-Dodson Law, and how does it relate to previously published neuroscience research?

The company was cash flow negative, while facing billions of dollars in lawsuits with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Employee turnover was over 20 percent. It was under investigation by the Department of Justice due to shady accounting practices, and worst of all, same-store sales were declining dramatically.\n\nDuring this time you might have noticed that Krispy Kreme doughnuts were ubiquitous: You could find them in several different types of grocery stores, even in gas stations.\n\nBut these doughnuts were sold wholesale.

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "Over the past few years, I’ve received thousands of emails from readers who want to improve their emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions. \n\nOf all the skills people want to develop, the following pops up over and over again:\n\nHow do I manage my emotions and reduce anxiety?\n\nDeveloping emotional intelligence is a lifelong journey. But after studying and teaching these skills for several years, I’ve found that the right frameworks, habits, and systems—along with intentional practice—can help you make significant progress when it comes to managing your emotions and all the benefits that come along with that skill.\n\nHere are five things I do to help me keep my emotions under control. \n\n1. Control your thoughts\n\nLearn how to control your thoughts, and you'll learn how to manage emotions. That's why I've found the following frameworks are invaluable. \n\n2. Use the rule of reframing\n\nThe Rule of Reframing involves reconceptualizing a problem by changing the way I look at it. \n\nFor example, as someone who enjoys working under rules and structure, I get thrown off when I start my workday late. (I work for myself.) But that’s often necessary because my wife and I split the household and childcare duties.\n\nSo, I have to change my perspective from “I'm getting such a late start; I hate this” to “It's great that I'm so flexible; We need this!”\n\n3. Use the golden question\n\nWhen I need to make a decision under emotional circumstances, I ask myself:\n\nHow will I feel about this in:\n\n-A day\n-A week\n-A month\n-A year\n-Five years\n\nThe golden question gives me a glimpse into the future, so I make better decisions in the present.\n\n4. Remind yourself that \"they don't know\"\n\nIf someone makes an ignorant or judgmental comment directed at me, the phrase “they don’t know” reminds me that:\n\n“They don't know what I know. They don't know what my life is like. They don't know all the other stuff that goes with this.”\n\nThis framework simply helps me recognize there’s no way the person could understand my situation. \n\nIt changes your feelings from: “I can't believe they said that\" to \"Oh, yeah. They don't know. All good.\"\n\n5. Use an emotional postmortem\n\nI still make mistakes, sometimes even big ones. When that happens, I buy out time to reflect and identify what led to the mistake so I can reduce the times it happens in the future.\n\nTo help me do that, I use an “emotional postmortem.” It’s a simple process that allows me to clear my mind, identify root causes, and make needed adjustments.\n\n(Read more in today's column.)\n\n#management #mentalhealth #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou #leadership",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "\"You really have to stand up for yourself.\"\n\nThat's the message Shark Tank Star Barbara Corcoran sent loud and clear in a recent interview she gave LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky. The interview is full of powerful lessons from Corcoran's life, but one story stood head and shoulders above the rest:\n\nThe time Shark Tank \"fired\" her, before she filmed a single episode.\n\nCorcoran said she received a call from a woman asking her to be on a new show called \"Shark Tank.\" Ecstatic, Corcoran agreed. She immediately went on a shopping spree, buying new outfits and autograph signing materials. \"I'm going to Hollywood!\" she excitedly told her friends.\n\nThen, Corcoran got a dreadful phone call telling her \"they changed their mind,\" and they had decided to give her seat to another woman.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe it,\" said Corcoran. \"It was the equivalent of [my ex-husband] telling me he was marrying my secretary.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Corcoran says she was \"crestfallen.\" But after taking a minute to feel sorry for herself, she took matters into her own hands.\n\nCorcoran wrote an email directly to Shark Tank creator, Mark Burnett.\n\n\"Dear Mark, I consider your rejection a lucky charm,\" Corcoran says. \"Everything good happens to me after I get rejected.\"\n\nCorcoran then detailed multiple stories as evidence, including the time Donald Trump told her she'd never collect a penny of her $4 million commission, after which Corcoran says she sued Trump and got every penny.\n\nCorcoran ended the email like this:\n\n\"I expect to be on that plane on Tuesday. And I hope you let me compete for the seat.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Burnett's secretary wrote Corcoran telling her she would have her chance to compete for the seat.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nCorcoran's actions teach a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions effectively. Let's break down three valuable takeaways from Corcoran's story, and see how you can apply them to your own work life. \n\n#SharkTank #BarbaraCorcoran #emotionalintelligence #management #personalgrowth #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "\"You're the type of manager the rest of us hate.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I just heard. I stood there for a few seconds, just processing it. \n \n'Is that true?' I remember thinking. 'Who else feels that way?'\n \nThat moment led to various occasions of self-reflection over the years. \n\nAll of us have to lead at some point. Some are thrust into positions of authority whether they like it or not, like the couple who suddenly discover they will become parents. \n \nMaybe you become a leader at work because you were good at your job, but you never really got any leadership training.\n \nSo how do you lead effectively? \n\nYou can start with the following:\n \n1. Set the example.\nLet's say you ask me how to get somewhere you've never been before. I could outline step by step directions, draw you a map, even provide details about landmarks to look out for.\n \nOr I could say: \"That's not too far out of my way. Why don't you just follow me?\"\n \nGuess which method works better.\n\nWhen you work hard to show others what you believe in, they'll naturally follow.\n \n2. Practice humility.\nBoss #1: Makes a mistake. When it's exposed, he/she refuses to admit it or tries to blame someone else.\n \nBoss #2: Realizes he/she isn't perfect. After recognizing a mistake, they readily admit and learn from it.\n \nWho would you prefer to work for?\n \n\"Leaders\" are no more perfect than followers. Owning up to that inspires respect.\n \n3. Praise sincerely and specifically.\nPraise and recognition can be motivating and inspiring—if they're authentic and specific.\n \nHow to start: Pick one or two employees a day and tell them something specific you've valued about their work (e.g., the way they handled a project or problem or a specific quality you saw in action). Tell them how and why you found their actions so beneficial. The more details, the better.\n \nOf course, you have to give critical feedback, too. But praise and appreciation is how your people know you care. And once they feel cared for, they'll be more open to hear how they can improve.\n \nWe're all faced with opportunities to lead, so focus on leading effectively.\n \nThose who follow will do so, not because they have to, but because they want to.\n\n***\n\nWant to learn more about how to be an emotionally intelligent leader?

As he attempted to begin his press conference, Kelce started to break down in tears. He took about a minute to gather himself before proceeding.\n\nOver the next 40 minutes, he waxed poetic: about the game of football, about the joy of winning, and the agony of defeat. He praised his family, his teammates, his coaches, his trainers, the cafeteria workers--and the city of Philadelphia. He shared memories, some good, some bad, but all deeply moving.\n\nThrough it all, Kelce alternated between reading and weeping.\n\nIn doing so, he taught a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, namely:\n\nCrying is good for you.\n\nWhat are the benefits of crying? Why does crying help you in emotional moments? And how can you use this knowledge to your advantage? \n\nCheck out today's column—along with a personal story of why I can relate to Kelce.\n\n#eagles #leadership #emotionalintelligence #management #personalgrowth #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

    "Justin Bariso's post 1yr ago": "Recently I was speaking with a fellow business owner about a paid membership community I joined, raving about how helpful it's been for me personally. \n\nI told him how the community was capped at 200 and how I thought that was the sweet spot for giving and adding value, and how I thought it might be a really good fit for him, too.\n\nTo be clear, I had zero angle in sharing this info; I had no business interest in the community (other than being a paying member).\n\nBut afterwards, I couldn't help but think to myself:\n\nI wonder if he thought I was being too pushy?\n\nA few days later, he texted me.\n\n\"Ah looks like [the community's] maxed out already at 200. But thanks!\"\n\nI started to text him back. \"Oh, no worries,\" I typed. \"New spots open up every month! I can put in a good word for you; I'm sure I can get you in.\"\n\nBut then, I thought about it:\n\nWhat good would this do? \n\nHad my friend shown any real interest in joining the community? \n\nHow might he feel if I kept pushing? How might it affect our relationship?\n\nIn the end, I didn't type any reply at all. I simply thumbed up his message, forgot about it, and moved on.\n\nThe reason has to do with a simple, three-word phrase that's become part of my emotionally intelligent toolbox:\n\nPerception is reality.\n\nHow can \"perception is reality\" enable you to develop and show empathy?

Most presented the phrase \"dynamic pricing\" as indicating that Wendy’s would test raising prices during high-traffic hours, similar to how ridesharing companies like Uber use “surge pricing” during times of high demand.\n\nAs reports circulated, backlash ensued. \n\nSoon after, though, Wendy’s claimed the whole thing was a big misunderstanding. \n\nIn a statement on the company’s official blog, Wendy’s said the update about digital menuboards was “misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest at our restaurants.”\n\n“We have no plans to do that and would not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most,” the statement continues. \n\nYikes.\n\nThis brings up some very big problems that have much to do with emotional intelligence—and more specifically, with the power of language and the emotional effect of the words you choose. \n\nWhat can you learn from this fiasco?

The letter begins with a tribute to Munger, who served as Vice Chairman at Berkshire Hathaway for decades before passing away a few months ago.\n\nBut while the media often portrayed Munger as playing second fiddle, and Munger himself often deferred to Buffett publicly, Buffett used his letter to set the record straight.\n\n“Charlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me take the bows and receive the accolades,” writes Buffett. \n\n“In the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those who had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten,” Buffett continued. “Berkshire has become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction crew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.”\n\nCharlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\n\nWith those nine words, Buffett not only honors his friend and business partner, he teaches a powerful lesson in emotionally intelligent leadership—both on his part, and the part of Munger. \n\nIn today's column, take a closer look at the lessons revealed by Buffett’s tribute, and see how you can apply them to your own business. \n\n#management #berkshirehathaway #warrenbuffett #charliemunger #leadership #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

Everyone told Watson how great she was, that she was knocking at the door of the most senior level of the company.\n\nYet, years went by. Plenty of promises and no action.\n\n\"When I would ask what's going on,\" says Maya, \"I was met with some version of this...\"\n\n\"With everything going on, It's just not the right time.\"\n\"We're working on a plan for you, sit tight.\"\n\"We need to see more from you.\"\n\n\"I became increasingly frustrated,\" Maya says. \"I started to believe that maybe it was me. Maybe I wasn't ready.\"\n\nThen, one day, Maya ran into one of her mentors, a well-respected VP at the company. Seeing that Maya looked frustrated, he asked if she was ok.\n\n\"No, I'm not ok,\" Maya replied. \"What more do I need to show? How much longer do I have to wait?\"\n\nMaya's mentor chuckled. Looking her dead in the eye, he said:\n\n\"I have more than 200 people in my organization. It's not statistically possible for me to think about their development or roadmap for their life and career. You have to take matters into your own hands or you'll be waiting forever. No one is coming to save you.\"\n\nMaya stood there speechless.\n\n\"He was absolutely right and I couldn't believe I never saw it that way until that moment,\" says Maya. \"I have always believed that frustration comes from a gap between expectations and reality. It set me free.\"\n\nThat conversation set Maya on a new path. Within a couple of years, she left Netflix. And less than two years after that, she had cofounded her own company and was working--and living--on her own terms.\n\nAll of this because Maya was able to finally see reality. She was able to \"remove the illusion.\"\n\nThis story reminded me of a conversation I recently had with a friend. As an American living in Germany, I talk a lot about language and words, and this friend shared a brilliant German word with a fascinating meaning.\n\nThe word is Enttäuschung (pronounced ent-TOY-shung).\n\nEnttäuschung is officially translated \"disappointment,\" but there's a deeper meaning when you look at the literal breakdown of the word. Doing so teaches a major lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions, as it can help you transform disappointment into something motivating and empowering.\n\nWhat does the German word Enttäuschung have to do with Watson's story?

That extra zero led to a huge jump in share price in after-hours trading, briefly creating about $2 billion in market cap for Lyft. \n\nAnalysts said they had never seen a mistake like this in the history of financial reporting. \n\n“We go through hours and hours of checking and double checking before something like this goes [public],” Risher explained. “It’s an unacceptable error. Again, ultimately it’s on me—I’m the CEO, the buck stops with me.”\n\nRisher’s humble reply is a great example of emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to build trust, motivate, and inspire.

Last night he won his third Super Bowl MVP award, which ties him with Hall of Famer Joe Montana and places him second (along with Montana) behind Tom Brady, who has five Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nIn his postgame interview, though, Mahomes credited Kansas City Head Coach Andy Reid for enabling him to achieve this level of success. Calling Reid the “best coach of all time,” Mahomes explained exactly how his mentor has helped him through the years.\n\n“For me, he brings out the best in me because he lets me be me,” Mahomes said. “He doesn’t try to make me anyone else. I don’t think I’d be the quarterback that I am if I didn’t have coach Reid being my head coach.”\n\nHe brings out the best in me.\n\nIn just seven words, Mahomes identifies a hallmark trait of all great coaches and leaders, teaching a brilliant lesson in the process: \n\nGreat leaders bring out the best in their people.\n\nAs a business owner or leader, how can you bring out the best in your people? To answer that question, let’s take a closer look at Reid’s coaching style, and see how he’s helped nurture the potential of his players. Then, we’ll see how exactly you can apply those lessons to your own work.\n\n(Read the full story in today's column.)\n\n#KansasCity #Chiefs #SuperBowlLVIII #PatrickMahomes #AndyReid #leadership #management #personalgrowth #emotionalintelligence #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

It seems that most of the business owner \"influencers\" you find online nowadays are in their 20s or early 30s, many of them without children of their own. So, we started forming our own communities, just to chat and exchange advice.\n\nAfter all, no one tells you how to manage business responsibilities when your kids get sick. Or, when you work from home with small children. Or, when things aren't going well—with the family or the business—but you have to keep pushing forward. \n\nI won't pretend I've figured it out. Like everyone, I have good days and bad days. (And good and bad months, too.) But over the years, I've developed a series of habits that not only help me run my business and personal life more effectively, they've saved my mental health.\n\nHere are 12 habits I try to live by. Maybe you'll find something useful for you, too. \n\n#businessowner #workfromhome #emotionalintelligence #management #personalgrowth #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

But it's also a master class in emotional intelligence, as it teaches artists and content creators a brilliant and counterintuitive lesson in how to create in a way that resonates with others.\n\nWhat lessons can we glean from Chapman and Combs? And how can you apply them to your own work? To answer those questions, let's dive into the story of why Combs decided to record his own version of Fast Car.\n\n(Check out the full performance and lessons learned in today's column.)\n\n#personalgrowth #emotionalintelligence #grammys #fastcar #tracychapman #lukecombs #management #leadership #eq #eqapplied #MakeEmotionsWorkForYouNotAgainstYou",

How is everybody doing?\"\n\nThat's the innocent question the \"Elmo\" account, representing everyone's favorite furry red Muppet from Sesame Street, posed on social media platform X on Monday.\n\nThe responses varied, with many expressing feelings of dismay and distress. Others shared feelings of joy and happiness. But another sentiment also came out loud and clear in the replies: \n\nGratitude.\n\n\"Thanks for asking,\" wrote one person.\n\n\"I am grateful for you, Elmo,\" chimed in another.\n\n\"Thanks for stopping by, bud,\" shared another.\n\nIn less than 48 hours, the post has received over 12,000 replies, over 100,000 likes, and has been reposted over 46,000 times. At the time of publish of this article, \"Elmo\" is the number one trending topic in the U.S. on X (Twitter), with over 338,000 posts.\n\n\"Wow! Elmo is glad he asked!\" responded the \"Elmo\" account yesterday. \"Elmo learned it is important to ask a friend how they are doing.\"\n\nOn the surface, a question like this coming from Elmo—or, more accurately, the Sesame Workshop social media team—may seem silly, superficial even. But look deeper, and it teaches a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage emotions.\n\nWhy is Elmo's question so powerful? And what lessons can business owners and leaders glean from it?

I loved to see how bugs interacted with their environment, and with each other. It was a whole world that I was privileged to observe and learn from.\n\nWhen I got older, I became an avid reader. Fiction, non-fiction, it didn't really matter. I wanted to learn as much as I could about, well, everything.\n\nThe problem when I became an adult, though, was finding the time to learn.

Or maybe moving sounds like fun to you and the news rolls right off your back and the wonderings of what you will eat for lunch quickly replace all other thoughts.\n \nChange. We all go through it, but we all respond very differently to it. Regardless of how open-minded we are, change in the workplace is inevitable. On one hand, it’s what makes innovation possible, but on the other hand, if we and our teams aren’t prepared, the pace of change can quickly outpace our ability to adapt.\n \nOne of the ways that we can handle change in the workplace better is by being more open-minded. Stephanie Vozza’s recent article on open-mindedness addresses just this. She discusses ways we can self-talk ourselves into openness to change when it comes. Read the full article here:",

Join Dov Baron and myself on the Leadership and Loyalty Podcast (to be released next week!) as we discuss the right reasons to stay or leave.\n \nWhen making your decision, consider things like the kinds of projects you find valuable, the types of one-on-one interactions you have, or even if there are clearly defined work hours. \n \nUltimately, jobs that feel like dream jobs include us in the decision-making process. If we are given a say in what is happening, if we feel like we have a genuine relationship with our employment and our employer, we are much more likely to feel like we are living the dream.",

You spend time searching for the right fit, you get to know each other, you discuss what’s important to you, you compromise until you find the thing that works best for both of you, and ultimately you hope you’ll be happy and fulfilled in your choice. \n\nBut after a time - and it might be immediately, it might be months or even years - you start to notice things that don’t quite fit. Time reveals all things, so maybe you start to feel antsy, unappreciated, and undervalued. You begin to reassess: Is this what I want? Is this making me happy? Does it matter if I’m happy? \n\nBut just like a relationship, there are so many factors that determine whether the right move is to stick it out in your current job or move on. Maybe there’s enough good to outweigh the discomfort. \n\nMaybe the discomfort is irrelevant to your long-term goals. \n\nMaybe the discomfort is a good challenge. \n\nHow do you decide?",

If this adjustment back into the office after the pandemic has you feeling frustrated, you are not alone.\n\nAdjusting to any different work environment can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to steal joy from your job. While working remotely has its perks, working in the office does too.\n\nThree reasons why office work is advantageous to work are simple connection, easy collaboration, and stronger culture. Ask yourself to name five reasons why working in an office might work to your advantage. Write these reasons down in a place you can see them often. When we keep the positive reasons at the forefront, it’s harder to let office work get us into a rut.\n\nSpeaking of good reasons to work in the office, Pete High, President of Metis Strategy, a business and IT advisory firm, wrote a brilliant article on his five reasons to work in the office.

Here's my response to a disappointing performance review and promised promotion: \n\nLet's make the assumption that you received a glowing performance review because you delivered value, demonstrated your worth, and exceeded goals and expectations for your role. Even after an A+ performance review, there might be other circumstances outside of your supervisor’s control prohibiting that promotion you were promised when you started, but you absolutely deserve to know the reasoning behind it.\n\nI would recommend scheduling a follow up meeting with your supervisor to discuss your performance review in more detail. Come prepared with your questions and supporting evidence on why you deserve the promotion (outside of it being communicated to you when you started). There is always room to negotiate, especially with a stellar performance review, but if the company can’t promote you now due to financial reason, think outside the box. Request additional paid time off, flexible work time, or a transportation allowance. \n\nLastly, work with your supervisor to create a plan that will pave the path to promotion. Take the initiative to come up with goals to push the business forward and ask for feedback along the way.",

Here are my thoughts around the question: Is it better to work for a company in a large city for a couple of years with competitive pay and, if I don’t like it, move back to a smaller city? Or would just starting out where you want to live and stay there be better?\n\nThere really is no right or wrong answer to your question, but there are additional things you should consider before location and compensation when applying for jobs.\n\nThe most critical part of entering the workforce post college is gaining relevant experience.  I would recommend focusing on the jobs that will pave the path to your ideal career long term, and what potential companies you would like to work for first. Location does play an important role is personal happiness, so focus on that next. Would you thrive in a big urban city? Would you be bored in a small city? Does the city have things that are important to you (ie: weather, bike trails, sports, theater, etc.)?\n\nSo as you gear up to start your search, I encourage you to thoroughly examine the actual job opportunity, company, and personal happiness when applying for jobs.",

    "Jack McKissen's post 1yr ago": "#workingremotely  SURVIVAL TIP: Get yourself a Layla 🐶 \n\nI adopted my oldest child when she was 4 and I was 22. \n\nThat was twenty years ago!!!\n\nThat time went by way faster than I expected, and it was hard to see her move out of the house and become her own person. Luckily, right before she left, she got a small, mostly chihuahua long-haired black puppy named Layla. \n\nFortunately for me, right after she got Layla, my daughter moved somewhere that didn’t allow dogs – leaving Layla and I to figure out what came next. Left to make her way in a family she didn’t expect to be part of, Layla took the prison approach and befriended the biggest, most tattooed guy in the joint. \n\nThat was me. \n\nAnd it worked. \n\nOver the past two years, Layla has completely wrapped me around her finger. I have lost all perspective about this dog. I believe she has magical healing abilities. I believe she can understand and contextualize almost everything I say. I even believe the phase where she ate her own poop resulted from a too-powerful brain just getting its signals crossed, due mostly to Layla being on a whole other level. \n\nI have said, out loud, on multiple occasions, with my wife and children in the room, that if all the madness in the world leads to a zombie apocalypse, I am stuffing Layla in a backpack and keeping her safe. \n\nBefore I even try to save anyone else. \n\nI usually say this when she's sitting on my lap, and when I do, Layla always stands up and licks my chin. \n\nDespite my wife’s obvious annoyance when I guarantee Layla’s safety, I promise you that if I told her I was stuffing her in a backpack, she wouldn’t lick my chin. \n\nSo, yeah. \n\nIf you're working remotely, and you don't already have one, get yourself a Layla. \n\nYou’re going to need one. \n\n#dogsoflinkedin #fridayinspiration",

    "Jack McKissen's post 1yr ago": "Tips on How to be a LinkedIn Top Voice 🏆 ! \n\nI am beyond thrilled to share that the LinkedIn editorial team selected me as a “LinkedIn Top Voice” for 2024! 🚀 \n\nOn my profile you’ll notice the little blue icon beneath my name, which means I have joined the likes of Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Barack Obama. It’s a pretty prestigious group! 🎉 \n\nLike I’ve been telling Megan McKissen for 20 years, it’s also the logical list for me to belong on 🤣 \n\nSeriously though, I really can’t capture how much this means to me. I was part of the first two classes of Top Voices in 2015 and 2016 – but a lot has changed for me since then, and a lot has changed for the world. Honestly, 2015 seems like a lifetime ago and an entire world away. \n\nHaving been a creator on here for 10 years, I get asked a lot about how I’ve built this platform. I wrote the article below when I was privileged enough to be on the LinkedIn team, but here are a few additional tips for growing your presence on LinkedIn:\n\n- Other social media platforms revolve around sharing your opinions. LinkedIn, in one form or another, is often about sharing your hopes, aspirations, and dreams. That means that you can help someone achieve some of those hopes and dreams by becoming part of their community. When you do that, you achieve true influence.\n\n- Be an original. There are thought leaders, and there are parrots. I don’t know if it’s because beaks and talons aren’t compatible with keyboards, but parrots have limited impact on LinkedIn – and in life. There is no thought leadership in being the millionth person to say AI (or the trend of the moment) is going to change the world. \n\n- Be willing to say something controversial. Like the way I just p*ssed off parrot owners and AI evangelists while announcing my Top Voice designation. But don’t say something controversial just for the sake of it, and keep your partisan politics away from this platform. \n\n- More than anything, be kind. If you’re a good person, and you let that light shine, and you are willing to be courageous and say what you think – even (and especially) when you know a handful of people are going to call you an idiot (or worse) – then you won’t have to worry about building a personal brand or becoming a “thought leader.” You’re already there.\n\nSo, thank you to Katie Carroll, the LinkedIn editorial team, Paul Petrone, Sean Callahan, and a long list of additional current and former colleagues for their support. And more than anything, a heartfelt thank you to the people who have read my work and engaged with me on this platform over the last decade!\n\nLike my hero (and the best content creator ever) Bruce Springsteen often says before an encore, “Thank you, thank you, thank you. You’ve been a wonderful audience.” 🎸 \n\nAnd I genuinely hope every one of you has a had a great start to what will be an amazing 2024!",

    "Suzy Welch's post 2d ago": "I love getting older. No lie. I’ve come to believe it’s the only way you find out what really matters in life. There are short cuts, I suppose, but none you’d really want to live through when you’re still young and blithe, like death and disappointment. Leave those, if you can, for your later years, when you’ve built the wisdom wall to endure them.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about what really matters to me lately, because I’ve been in go-go-go mode on my Becoming You book tour. I’ve been missing my dogs so much it’s getting out of control, and I find myself randomly crying at photos of my dachshund, Pierre. But then, I remember, “Yeah, but this work you’ve done, it matters. Buck up. Keep going.”\n\nToday I was struck by another thing-that-matters which my dotage has taught me, and that is that real people matter. As in, human people – people in the room with you. This is not a platitude. It is more like a warning. Because our relationships can get very virtual these days, if we are not careful. They can become texts and emails and DMs, and never seeing a person in the flesh or hearing their voice. It is so easy. \n\nIt is too easy.\n\nMore on this below. ⬇️",

Yes, a ✴️ value. ✴️\n\nAnd your life – everyone’s life – would be better if we could understand and operationalize that fact.\n\nOur ideal place can drive everything about our lives and our careers. Do we need to live in Milwaukee because of family? Do we only feel at home near the ocean? Is our identity inextricably linked to LA or New Orleans or Miami?\n\nOr, by contrast, are we digital and emotional nomads, who can live anywhere?\n\nLocation, location, location. Yes, it matters. As much as the values of family and financial security.\n\nAnd yet, we too often don’t admit that out loud. We suppress it as a data point, or minimize it. Because the other “big” values – the usual suspects – get all the air time.\n\nIt’s kind of crazy, isn’t it? \n\nI was reminded of the importance of location as a value during my recent book tour visit to Boston, where I used to live. Let’s just say you can go home again, and it can be very confusing.\n\nSome of the happiest years of my family’s life were in Boston – my kids and husband loved it there – and when I looked out at the audience during my talk at the Harvard Club of Boston, I saw my two sisters, my daughter-in-law, my niece, and many dear friends. The event was even moderated by a longtime bestie, Linda P., the CEO of Boston Globe Media. \n\nAfter the event, many wonderful people – people whom I adore – approached and told me, “You should come back!” \n\nShould I? Could I? \n\nFor as long as I can remember, one of my resounding top values has been…New. York. City.\n\nSo there you go. For now, at least.\n\nLook, sometimes there are no easy answers to questions about location as a value. Where we live can be contentious and confusing, given circumstances and opportunities, and given the fact that we are, well, human.\n\nBut ignore location as a value at your peril.\n\nBecause in the end, home is one of the most personal choices we make—and one of the most revealing.\n\nPhoto credit: Aram Boghosian",

Apparently (and to my delight) he’d actually been listening to my interview with Gayle King about the Becoming You method.\n\nAnd so I told him about my (cool, new) research-backed test, The Values Bridge, which you can easily find online. But then I asked him, “What do you think your values are right now?”\n\nHe hesitated, stammered a bit, and then shrugged with a smile. “Of course, family,” he said, “then love, I guess, and friends?”  \n\nI was not surprised by his uncertainty!\n\nSo many of us barely understand the term “values,” let alone know our own with any clarity. That’s why I created The Values Bridge, which measures where you stand on each of the 15 personal values that drive our actions and behaviors.\n\nYes, 15.\n\nI mentioned that number to the sound tech, and his eyebrows shot upward. “Go find them out!” I laughed, and I hope he does.\n\nI hope everyone does, because it is only when we know our values that we can begin to construct a life of purpose, one lived by design, not default. \n\nAnd tell me, who doesn’t want that?",

And again, by “we,” I mean “we, definitely including me.”\n\nThe reasons are so, well, reasonable: We’re busy, things are crazy, and sometimes, the truth is, not everyone on our team is killing it. They’re distracted, or struggling, or just…behind. \n\nBut clap we still must. \n\nPeople need to hear it. To keep going.\n\nToday, I zipped around Brooklyn on a unseasonably chilly and windy morning to celebrate my daughter and her partner as they ran in their first half-marathon. They are both artists by trade. Translation: they were in it to finish, not win. 🙂\n\nMy other kids and I managed to holler our encouragement at several points along the route. It was thrilling — for us.\n\nAnd soon, we were to hear, it meant the world to them too.\n\nThey weren’t out there clocking six minute miles, but knowing we believed in them while they tried “made us want to be great,” as my daughter put it later. “It made us want to keep going as fast as we could go.”\n\nShe was exhausted but filled with joy as she spoke, for in fact, she and her partner had just posted their best times ever.\n\nMaybe you are a leader who gets this right every day. This cheering stuff. If so, bravo. \n\nI am not yet, but I sure want to be. And so I’m off to the races — how about you?",

And so, to entice you to smash that purchase button today, I’m offering a signed book plate if you do… and…drumroll please… an exclusive first look at Chapter Five, “The Bridge to Yourself, and Your Future,” in which I describe all the Becoming You values in gritty, vivid detail.\n\nHere’s my promise: your mind will be blown. In a good way! \n\nWhy? Because I am going to be bold enough to say you probably don’t know your values right now. Or you don’t know them well enough. My recent research shows that only 17% of people even know the definition of values with clarity, and only 7% can name their own with specificity. Usually, people list their values as “Family,” “Financial Security,” and then a virtue like “Honesty,” or an aspiration, like “Happiness.”\n\nSpoiler alert, there are 15 core human values, and they all exist on a continuum. Family and financial security are among them, but they are hardly all of them.\n\nThat matters. If you want to live your purpose.\n\nSo get a head start on that process today with Chapter 5!

Then my kids grew up and told me, well, that I was pretty darn good.\n\nGod, how I wish I had known all along! It would have saved me so much guilt, exhaustion, fear, and grief.\n\nSo, I invented a tool that can help. Brag incoming – sorry not sorry.\n\nIt's called PIE360 and it tells you – right here and right now – how the world experiences you. At home, at work, in life. Specifically, it tells you how your family, coworkers, and friends see you in terms of the quality of your relationships with people, the thoughtfulness of your ideas, and the reliability of your execution, aka how well you get things done. \n\nPeople. Ideas. Execution. P-I-E. \n\nThe “360” part of the tool’s name comes from the fact that you can send this assessment to up to 40 people from all around your life, giving you a 360-degree perspective. It has 15 questions, takes under five minutes to complete, and is completely and utterly anonymous.\n\nI invented this tool, very simply, because I think we waste too much time in life hating ourselves for crimes no one else thinks we committed. And because we too often ignore or deny behaviors of ours that we should fix ASAP.\n\nBecoming You, the career-discovery methodology I teach at NYU Stern School of Business, is designed to get you to your purpose. It is built on deep self-understanding. A big piece of that is knowing how the world experiences you…really.\n\nI love that PIE360 is here to help! I wish I’d had it myself. For the knowledge it would have given me, the heartache it would have prevented, and the growth it would have enabled. But ta-da, better late than never. If you end up using it, PLEASE PLEASE let me know what you think in the comments below. I mean it, because I made it for you.",

I laughed at the familiarity of it.\n\nIt reminded me (lovingly!) of so many of my students, who are alternatively nihilists and fabulists. One day they believe the world is ending and there is no hope for them ever making a decent living, and the next day, they are imagining becoming a top CEO by age 35 with three beautiful houses and four perfect kids.  \n\nSigh.\n\nI get the world is confusing these days. Those of us who’ve been through a few cycles of insanity don’t like the current chaos, but we sense it will eventually right itself. \n\nI think the difference with Gen Z is that all they have known in their lives is chaos; they think it’s never going away.\n\nAnd so they zig and zag between “whatever” of the \"bummer\" variety, and “whatever” of the “why not?” variety. You can’t blame them, I guess, and maybe they’re even right.\n\nAs for me, though, I’m still holding onto the long game view of the world.

We have to! \n\nIt’s the working parent’s lament. Perennial, frustrating, maddening…and occasionally even life-changing. \n\nThe other day, I spent the morning speaking to a group of brilliant young employees at Meta, Instagram, and Threads about the Becoming You purpose-discovery methodology (and my new book, thank you very much). The audience was mainly women in their 20s and 30s, a portion of them moms. Afterward, I spoke to many individually, and ended up in conversation with an engineer who posed the question above.\n\nDon’t get me wrong – she was not panicked. She was…pensive. Or better yet, perplexed. Because how could it be, she asked, that so many bright, highly competent, energized women keep finding themselves in the same place? \n\nTorn – sometimes agonizingly – between their love of their kids, their love of their work, and their love of their own authenticity?\n\nIt keeps happening, I told her with a sigh, because values are values – and sometimes they conflict. \n\nFor instance, they conflict like crazy when you’re between the ages of, say, 28 and 42, when your kids, boss, and sense of sanity and self-preservation all want all of you at the same time. In the language of Becoming You, we call those values, respectively, Familycentrism, Achievement, and Agency. \n\nIf you want them all with near-equal intensity, and many of us do, let’s just say it’s not easy to manifest. \n\nBut the inherent conflict of values can be managed better the same way all conflicts can be. \n\nWith a shared language of understanding.\n\nI hope Becoming You’s new lexicon can be helpful that way. \n\nBecause the question I heard at Meta will likely be with us forever. And we need to share solutions from every quarter. \n\nTell me, how are you talking about it now?\n\nBy the way, I'm offering a completely free 30-minute webinar about the Becoming You language of values on April 16 at 12:15pm.

That’s the plan.  \n\nAs one recent participant put it, “I left Discovery Day with a full heart and a mind brimming with possibilities. The journey to my purpose won’t be easy, but the work we did in class has become my compass - pointing me exactly where I need to go. I put my notice in after 13 years last week. Becoming You gave me the courage to do it.”  \n\nSpace for Discovery Day is limited, and please know that a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, an academic center committed to advancing the study of self-discovery and meaningful careers. \n\nFind more detailed information here: https://lnkd.in/ekQSaDmF Hope to see you there!",

    "Suzy Welch's post 2mo ago": "⛔ “No.” ⛔\n\n There, I said it. \n\nThe single most powerful word on the journey to your purpose.\n\nIt can be terrifying to utter, especially for a person like me. And maybe like you?\n\nAnd yet, saying it can free you. It can do better, too: It can fuel you and focus you.\n\nThis morning, I received an email from a CEO that I respect and admire. Over the years, I’ve said “yes” to his every request for advice and time without a moment’s hesitation, and he has often returned the favor. That’s how business –and friendship – work.\n\nBut this time, I took a dose of my own medicine. The Becoming You methodology, which I teach at NYU Stern School of Business, is designed to help people answer the question, “What should I do with my life?” I also teach the method to non-MBAs asking the same thing. In fact, I just spent the weekend teaching it to people from every walk of life who had traveled to our campus from Belgium and Singapore, California and Milwaukee (see the pic below). \n\nMy teaching always emphasizes that your journey to purpose cannot ever really be controlled – because life happens. But it is faster and clearer and has fewer bone-headed detours when you know your values, aptitudes, and interests in their very specifics. Because at the intersection of those three lies your “Area of Transcendence.\"\n\nYour purpose.\n\nMy purpose is helping people find their purpose. And part of that has to be walking the talk. \n\nDo I do that all the time? Of course not, because, well, I am a messy messball sometimes, just like most people, or at least the people I know and love. We are all just doing our best.\n\nBut today, looking at the email from the CEO, inspired by my students and their stories of self-discovery, I asked myself, “Does this demand on my time align with my values?”\n\nIt did not.\n\nNext: “Does it lean into my aptitudes?”\n\nAgain, nope.\n\nAnd then, finally, “Does it reflect my interests?”\n\nThird strike. I was out.\n\nAnd so I wrote my CEO friend back and said, “I love to say yes to you, but this time, I cannot.” And a minute later, he responded, “No problem. I understand.”\n\nIt made me wonder about the number of times I should have said no before!\n\nWe always talk about the power of yes to open doors. But I’m here to say that NO has the power to close the ones you shouldn’t enter, and keep you on the right path forward. \n\nIf you have a story about a time you said “No” and it changed your career for the better, drop it in the comments below. 👇",

The other kind.\n\nThe hater kind. 🤯\n\nHere’s the \"inflammatory\" thing I said on Instagram this week: “It’s so easy to live a B+ life, but an A+ is available to us – if we do the work.” \n\nI love this opinion of mine! It took me my whole life to get to it. Because I, like 99.999% of all human beings, let other people edit my life for years and years and years. Why? Because I loved them.\n\nBut over time, I came to know and embrace my true values, and I became the author of my life. None of the “editors” seemed to mind, by the way. The truth is, the people who love us usually want us to be authentic, once they get used to the idea. (Translation: “Eventually, my darling kids and beloved husband got over me working full-time.” 💗)\n\nMy journey to myself is hardly uncommon. Indeed, that’s why Becoming You exists, to help people on the road to full authenticity, where we live our values to our heart’s delight. Doing so is not a selfish thing, by the way, it is a flourishing thing.\n\nYou would think this would be uncontroversial, right, supporting authenticity? We certainly did, when we posted the offending video. But no. Apparently, urging people to not settle for OK, but keep trying for great is dangerous, entitled, and out of touch. Who knew?\n\nLook, people are entitled to their views, just as I am. More than anything, really, I don’t hate their comments, I hate how much some people want to hate. It’s entertainment to them. It’s sport.\n\nIck. \n\nThe mission statement of Becoming Universe, which is what we call our little company amongst ourselves, is “To support, assist, and throw love on every single messy messball of the world as we all do the hard work of answering what it is we plan to do with our one wild and precious life.”\n\nMy favorite part of that blurb is the phrase “throw love.” We are in the love business over here. My second favorite part is “messy messball,” a term I invented to describe humanity, myself thoroughly included.\n\nWhat I hate is that we are not all in the love business.",

    "Suzy Welch's post 2mo ago": "I hate hiring people. \n\nBefore I was a leader, I thought hiring was going to be fun and exciting. To be honest, I probably imagined it would be some kind of power trip where I’d get to sit back, audition eager candidates, and pick the best one. \n\nNowadays, I do a lot of hiring as the CEO of the company that makes Becoming You possible. I also teach hiring as part of my NYU Stern School of Business management class, where I repeatedly tell my MBAs that the only easy thing about hiring is getting it wrong. \n\nLately, I have been especially down on hiring because I am trying to find a copywriter. After investing hours and hours sorting through resumes and interviewing, and not a small amount of money on advertising, two great finalists dropped out saying the job entailed “too much work,” and a third great finalist stayed around until she didn’t. Yep, I got ghosted. Sadly, this is a familiar pattern.\n\nNow, there is one bright spot, in that we have just brought on board a spectacular CRM lead, who was perfect throughout the hiring journey from start to finish. But she’s a rare bird – which is why we are so happy she’s now part of our flock.\n\nI have no great wisdom here except to acknowledge that business is hard. It’s worth it, yes. But it’s hard in every way. \n\nWhat are your tips for hiring, or getting through business when the going gets tough? Comment your thoughts below. 👇",

Others not so much, to put it mildly. Such an approach to life, they seemed to concur, is a fast track to burnout. \n\nMaybe so, but not in my experience. In fact, every time I’ve pushed myself to be better at something, or urged my team to reach for the next level, it’s led to excitement. And hope.🤸\n\nYesterday, I wrapped up teaching “Becoming You: Crafting The Authentic Life You Want and Need” for the semester. You can see from the pic below that it ended on a high note. 👏 \n\nI should have felt great – and I did.\n\nBut this morning, I woke up and scribbled two full pages of notes about what I need to do better next semester. That’s me in my robe at 7am getting all my ideas for improvements logged into my notebook. \n\nNo, I don’t think there was anything “mediocre” about my class this semester. I wouldn’t have taught it if I thought so. But I also think that we can – and should – always keep striving to elevate, expand, and deepen what we share with the world.\n\nIt kind of annoys me to feel any other way. 😉",

And you probably wouldn't be wrong.\n\nBut all of those things could happen -- and probably did happen -- because the company's culture facilitated poor decision-making, lack of urgency, and diminished transparency. In other words, the culture allowed mediocrity and paralysis to creep in and take hold. \n\nI don't know the details of the Forever 21 situation, but I know how business works. And how it doesn't. \n\nBehind every bankruptcy is a broken culture. I'd bet the company on it.",

It was a great story, my producer said, because for every pair of false eyelashes this entrepreneur sold, she donated a pair to a woman who had lost her own eyelashes during chemotherapy.\n\n“How sweet,” I thought, and off I went.\n\nAnd thus began my friendship with Karissa Bodnar, the founder and CEO of Thrive Causemetics Inc. – a company that has become so successful that last year it gave $150 million to charity. \n\nThrive is so well run as a business and Karissa is such a freaking great CEO that last year I invited her to do a star turn in my management class at NYU Stern School of Business. My students were awestruck by her wisdom about leadership. By the way, she is now 34.\n\nIn my Becoming You class – and in my podcast, newsletter, and workshops – I am always urging people to do the hard work to discover their values, their aptitudes, and economically viable interests so that they can find and live their purpose. Because your purpose makes you feel exquisitely alive, and usually, when you feel that way, you turn around and spread the joy.\n\nKarissa is case in point. When I met her in Seattle in 2015, she was making lipstick in her kitchen. She knew her purpose even then, to build a company that was as philanthropic as it was profitable, and in doing so, make the world a better place. \n\nShe’s done that, but at Thrive’s 10th anniversary party that I attended this week, she said she’d only just begun. \n\nI love that good news – and Karissa – too. For who she is, what she’s done, and for being an example of purpose to us all.\n\nWho comes to mind for you as someone living their true purpose? Tag them in the comments below!",

    "Suzy Welch's post 2mo ago": "A few weeks ago, my podcast was devoted to a listener – a working mother of two teens – who wanted advice about whether she should abandon her successful career as a museum administrator. Her presenting symptom, if you will, was that she was profoundly exhausted. The career-kids balancing act was just getting too hard.\n\nAs I listened to her all-too-familiar lament, at one point I observed that the problem with trying to do kids and work at the same time comes down to biology. There are, I noted, about fifteen years of your life when your children need your undivided attention and complete availability, and the same goes for work, that is, if you’d like to get taken seriously and get promoted. \n\nSadly, due to the nature of baby-making and the conventional professional trajectory baked into the economic system, those 15 years overlap. That is, child-rearing and career-planning tend to occur roughly between the ages of 27 and 42. \n\nIn that period, everybody wants all of you, bosses and kids alike, and that’s not even mentioning your partner, friends, siblings, and parents.\n\nIt’s just a terrible, inescapable trick of timing. And here’s the thing, until AI figures out a way to replumb the human body, that trick will not change.  \n\nSo, like never.\n\nI wish it weren’t so. But it is. I love AI, and, like many, I think it is capable of doing almost everything. Coding whole websites. Analyzing massive documents. Forging marketing plans out of the ether. \n\nBut making working parenthood easier? To that, I just say, “Hmm.” How about you? More on this in today's newsletter. ⬇️",

Your sense of possibility about the future?\n\nI’m sitting here hoping ardently that you’re thinking, “All good, Suzy, all good.”\n\nBut!\n\nBut if you’re not saying “All good,” and instead something closer to, “Well, um,” then I have something to share.\n\nI’m beyond excited to announce that my NYU Stern School of Business class, “Becoming You: Crafting the Life You Want and Need,” is once again being offered as a three-day intensive on campus, open to all, from recent college grads trying to figure out their first job to retirees wondering what to do with their next chapter. The dates are March 21-23, 2025.\n\nEvery time we hold this Intensive, I am floored (in a good way!) by how just three days can change someone’s life. But please don’t take it from me; here are a few comments from previous participants:\n\n“I have that fire back… I only wish that I had been able to do it earlier.” \n\n“For the first time, I felt truly seen and validated and I was finally able to acknowledge: Yep, this is my calling! I know what to do with my life.” \n\n“Whether you are starting out in your studies or career, or want a change in direction later in life, this course is for you. The class was interactive, the material was so powerful, and learning how to talk about values was incredibly impactful.”\n\nOn the first day we will work together to excavate your unique core values, deploying multiple self-discovery exercises – which I happen to love because they’re fun, but also, and mainly, because they’re remarkably effective. We will then move on to day two, where we will assess and pinpoint your underlying aptitudes with a series of scientifically validated tests. And on the final day, we will explore which kinds of jobs, industries, and/or megatrends are the best match for you, before synthesizing the process to craft your own “Area of Transcendence,” that is, the purpose that lies at the intersection of your values, aptitudes, and interests.\n\nSpace for the Becoming You Three-Day Intensive is limited, and please know that a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund the NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, an academic center committed to advancing the study of self-discovery and meaningful careers.\n\nFor more detailed information, including an FAQ, click here: https://lnkd.in/ePxS7EwT I hope to see you there!",

She was just home from medical school on break, and I had been waiting for her. “Is it possible for someone my age to have a heart attack?” I whispered urgently.\n\n“For God’s sake, Suzy, you just have heartburn!” she assured me, laughing. “Lay off the candy canes!”\n\nShe wasn’t wrong about the candy canes, but she wasn’t right about me having heartburn. \n\nI had anxiety. \n\nI didn’t know that, though, until I had my own kids. One day, on the way to first grade, speaking softly from the back seat, one of my sons said, “Mommy, my chest is burning. It always burns in the morning.” We were soon at the doctor, who put a name to his ailment.\n\nBy that time in my life, and indeed, by the time I was away at the boarding school shown in the photo below, I had assembled a toolkit of strategies for managing my “heartburn” – running, journaling, and praying. To that list, I soon added an origami class with my son, and together we began a journey together to create his own set of coping skills.\n\nI rarely think about my own anxiety anymore, but I think all the time about the anxiety of the students I teach, because I must. Especially in my NYU Stern School of Business class Becoming You, where we talk about discovering your purpose and then designing your life to seize it.\n\nTime and again, my students ask, “Is it even possible to plan your career when you have anxiety? Just living feels hard enough.”\n\nMy answer – and you may disagree – is that planning is an antidote to anxiety, not an anathema. \n\nLook, careers can cause stress whether you have anxiety or not. You can run from that stress, or avoid it, and just let life happen to you. \n\nOr you can step into your fear by amassing detailed data about yourself and the world of work. And then using that data to build a roadmap.\n\nI understand the first approach. Indeed, I literally feel for people who choose it.\n\nBut if you can, even if it feels very hard at first, I urge you to try the second. Your anxiety will fight you, but it’s the fight of your life to fight back. \n\nI am working on a podcast right now to talk more about anxiety and career planning. If you have any thoughts – or better yet, advice – please share them in the comments below. \n\nAnd by the way, I never did lay off the candy canes.",

How current you are, in terms of events, people, and trends, drives the level of your currency, i.e. your value, to your organization and/or your customers.\n\nWhich is why every year my team watches me weep softly into my hands when my invitation to the highly coveted JP Morgan Miami conference arrives. Why? Because this conference makes me so much smarter. \n\nSo. Much. Smarter. \n\nThe conference, which has become renowned for its “over-the-top brilliant and extremely famous” speakers, fills my head with insights I would have never had, introduces me to trends I would have never seen coming, and explains aspects of the economy and the markets that it would take me years to understand otherwise. I remember sitting in the audience several years ago as a young CEO described a technology his company was working on. When his words finally clicked, I jotted in my notebook, “This could change EVERYTHING.”\n\nThat was Sam Altman letting us know #AI and OpenAI was coming. \n\nMy brain after this conference makes me SUCH a better teacher and guide to people trying to figure out what to do with their lives, because of what I know about where the economy is actually going. \n\nWhich is why I 🩶 love 🩶 attending. Also, Miami in February is not a bad thing. (See photo.☀️)\n\nOK! Let’s carry on! \n\nThe conference, however, or more specifically its aftermath, left me wondering if people might be approaching the point of new-stuff saturation. I mean, could it be 🚨 newphobia 🚨 is creeping in?\n\nWhen I got home from the conference, I was euphoric, but I noticed something different for the first time. Whenever I started to share all the futurist ideas and oncoming changes I heard about with friends…eyes began to glazeth over.\n\nAt first I thought it was me being extra, but then one friend and another and another started to say things like, “Wow, ok. So that’s enough, OK? I just can’t take in any more change.” \n\nA few data points does not make a trend. But I’ve gotten enough pushback on my reports from Miami that I am thinking that maybe, as a society, we might be reaching some kind of tipping point with non-stop upheaval. And if that’s true, what will it mean for all of us?\n\nThat question makes me go hmm. How about you?\n\nIf you’re wondering HOW to increase your currency, I’m having a free, free, totally free 30-minute webinar to share how I stay current (and why it’s so important).

But this week, I was with my students when media icon Joanna Coles did a star turn as a guest in my “Management with Purpose” class at NYU Stern School of Business. Her insights were many and various, but one in particular left me shooketh, and I was not alone.\n\n💣 “Trust only happens in person.” 💣\n\nJoanna dropped this truth bomb when I asked her how, as the chief content officer of Hearst's Hearst Magazines, she’d managed to oversee 300 different magazines around the world. She quickly responded that she’d built trust with each publication’s editorial and business leaders. I pushed again – “How?”\n\n“Well, face-to-face,” she replied, “because that’s the thing, isn’t it? Trust only happens in person. It can’t really grow without actually being in the same room, having a meal, having a laugh, talking –”\n\nAt which point, I snuck a glance at my students to see who was still breathing. Because I knew that these words were not, shall we say, music to the ears of all of them, e.g. the ones still holding onto the hopes of careers of remote or hybrid work.\n\nAre they music to yours? \n\nThey are to mine. In fact, I love them. Because they are so true.\n\nLook, I adore working from home as much as the next dog person.

We want change. Many times, we need change. But then we try to make change, and boom, we hit our first roadblock, and then our next. One wheel of the “New You” dragster comes off, and then the engine seizes, and the next thing you know, we’ve hit a wall and the reinvention race is, well, kaput.\n\nThere has to be a better way, and there is. Which is to stop thinking just about what we want to be when we’re our \"new selves\" – but how we’re going to get there.

Good news, though! A proven methodology is ready to help.  \n\nDiscovery Day: The Becoming You Experience, an accelerated, one-day version of my career-discovery course Becoming You, is coming to NYU Stern School of Business’s campus on Saturday, February 1, 2025. My plan is that you walk out the door with nothing short of a new sense of purpose and a roadmap to your future.\n\nAre you wondering, “But how?” Read on!\n\nIn the first part of the Discovery Day, we will work together to excavate your unique core values, deploying six of my tested self-discovery exercises, which I happen to love because they’re fun, but also, and mainly, because they’re remarkably effective. We will then move on to assessing and pinpointing your underlying aptitudes with a series of scientifically validated tests, and after that, we will explore which kinds of jobs, industries, and/or megatrends are the best match for you.  \n\nDiscovery Day concludes with each participant using Becoming You’s synthesis process to craft their own “Area of Transcendence,” the purpose that lies at the intersection of their values, aptitudes, and interests. \n\nIf this all sounds intense, truth be told, it is. In academic settings, Becoming You involves 24 hours of instruction. Other Becoming You workshops cover its material in three back-to-back, eight-hour days. The Discovery Experience is different. Much of its testing occurs before we convene, and it is, for lack of a better term, an exercise in “extreme learning,” requiring a certain kind of commitment and focus from its participants. But we’ve seen it work time and again, and we know it can be a great fit for those who want and need Becoming You’s outcomes as quickly and efficiently as possible. \n\nSpace for Discovery Day is limited, and please know that a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund NYU Stern |  Initiative on Purpose and Flourishing, an academic center committed to advancing the study of self-discovery and meaningful careers. \n\nFor more detailed information, including an FAQ, click here: https://lnkd.in/eb_Ed_GT I hope to see you there!",

Who, for instance, hasn’t called themselves a “good listener?” Thought so!\n\nSame goes for the term “adaptable.” Suddenly, that’s what everyone claims to be. \n\nExcept…are we really? How can we even tell?\n\nGood news, here’s a hack. In my recent Becoming You podcast conversation with Daniel Roth, the Editor-in-Chief of LinkedIn and LinkedIn News, he suggested that we take a look at how tightly we hold on to how things are done. Not why. Not if. Not when.\n\n➡️ How. ⬅️\n\nI love this advice because it’s immediately actionable. The next time someone asks you to do something differently at work or in life, stop and watch your reaction. Do you instantly get riled up? Do you start to feel a resistance ball form in your chest? Or do you pause and think, “Hmm, interesting. Worth a try!”\n\nI had just such an opportunity for self-observation today when a team member suggested we use AI to write a piece of content that’s been on my to-do list for a long time. Now, let it be noted, I hate this particular task – it’s a caption-type thing – but still, it’s been MY job.\n\nThen: “Let’s see if the Suzy Bot can do it!” my colleague brightly offered. \n\nWith Dan’s advice at the front of my mind, I paused. I will admit, a tweak of “nfw” came over me. But then, just as quickly, I almost felt giddy. “What a cool idea!” I said.\n\nThat’s the good news. This old gray mare is, it seems, adaptable. The bad news is that the Suzy Bot delivered a D-minus product, so Real Suzy still has a job. For now!\n\nAnd maybe for the time being too, because I’m taking Dan Roth’s advice to heart. Stop, ponder, and welcome every new how.",

Which is that you should collect mentors like Pokemon cards and trade them the same way. Yep.\n\nLook, the received wisdom is that young people should latch onto a powerful, brilliant, older, wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi type, who will protect and guide them as they criss-cross the career universe all their lives long.\n\nOops, the problem is, such a mentor does not exist, and this never happens. It’s nonsense.\n\nThat’s why I advise my students at NYU Stern School of Business to see everyone they meet as a mentor – because everyone knows something you don’t. Everyone is better at something than you. Everyone can teach you something, even if it’s just a little something, about how to operate and thrive in this world. \n\nAnd guess what? They don’t even have to know they’re your mentor while they’re at it. \n\nFurther – as soon as you get such mentors into your collection, you should tell other people about them. Why not? It’s always wonderful to help other people, and in the best case scenario, those same people will return the favor with, “Hey, check out this person too…”\n\nIn that spirit, here are two of my mentors for you to add to your pack, the great Hoda Kotb of NBC News, and the brilliant Wendy Suzuki, a colleague at New York University. I cannot more enthusiastically recommend you to follow them, take in their many lessons about life, growth, overcoming adversity, and self-discovery.

I relaxed, went on a tangent or two, told stories I rarely tell, and found the time to stop and laugh at myself along with the audience. I can't lie. I kind of loved being unprepared. And I totally loved the many conversations I had with audience members afterward, who reached out to me just as I had reached out to them.\n\nAs an imperfect fellow traveler trying to figure it all out. \n\nNow, I'm not saying I won't be in my usual Seal Team Six prep mode for my next speech. Winging it is generally not my thing. But my spontaneous speech the other day was a great reminder of how wonderful authenticity always is, for you and those you touch.",

And it hurts a lot.\n\nI was reminded of this eternal business truism when my family convened recently to take our newest member on her first museum trip. We picked the Temple of Dendur installation at The Metropolitan Museum of Art because, with a 2-year-old in the stroller, we were definitely going for the “wow” factor. \n\nIt worked. But what wowed me along the way – remember, I’m a management professor – was learning that the Roman Emperor Augustus built the temple in 10 B.C. essentially to convince his newly conquered territory that, sure, there was a new leader in town, but they had nothing to worry about. He got Egyptian values and traditions. He respected them. Look, he’d even build a huge monument proving it!\n\nThe rest, literally, is history. In the years that followed, things changed rapidly and massively, with the imposition of new laws and a new culture. For most  Egyptians, nothing was ever the same.  \n\nSound familiar?\n\nMy class Becoming You at NYU Stern School of Business is designed to guide students to identify their values, aptitudes, and interests. I’ve always thought (forgive me) my curriculum was timely. Now I’m wondering if it’s timeless, too?\n\nBosses come and bosses go. And when they do, everything will change.

    "Suzy Welch's post 7mo ago": "With the DIRECTTV and DISH Network announcement, another big merger is in the news, which can only mean one thing. Three deadly sins are about to be committed by the leadership of both companies. They won’t mean to! But most mergers have a way of being a lot messier than they should be. And who pays the price? Employees for starters, but customers and shareholders too. (From LinkedIn News's Emma W. Thorne: https://lnkd.in/ePCCVs7S) \n\nMy husband Jack Welch and I originally wrote about these merger “sins” about 20 years ago in our book WINNING. And I still teach them in my NYU Stern School of Business class about management. Let’s just say, sadly, that they have stood the test of time. Consider:\n\n1. The first merger sin occurs when leadership claims there has been a “merger of equals.” That’s exactly the case with DirectTV and Dish. As any business veteran will tell you, such a thing only exists in theory. In the real world, leaders would be better off quickly and candidly identifying who’s the new boss, so that employees can plan their lives and careers accordingly.\n\n2. The second sin occurs when leadership pays excessive, and sometimes exclusive, attention to strategic fit instead of cultural fit. Talk about putting the cart in front of the horse! If anything good is to come of this merger – or any – a healthy new, consolidated culture must come first. Culture is how work gets done, and to quote the great Peter Drucker, it eats strategy for breakfast.\n\n3. The third merger sin is related to the first. It occurs when leaders engage in what I call “timid integration,” with both sides tiptoeing around each other to see where the landmines are buried. It’s human – but that doesn’t make it a best practice. With good leadership, a full integration should take no longer than 90 days. That’s right, 90 days.\n\nLook, mergers are hard to get right, but companies keep doing them for a reason. They hold so much promise! Here’s hoping the leaders of DirectTV and Dish can fulfill theirs by avoiding the mistakes so many executives have before them.",

Try giving it! \n\nEvery manager – every human being – struggles with delivering a tough message in a way that will be heard and yet not hurtful.\n\nThere is a solution. It’s called the OILS approach, invented by Emily Field, a partner at McKinsey & Company, whom I am fortunate enough to bring to my class NYU Stern School of Business every semester.\n\nOILS guides managers through delivering feedback with four steps.\n\n\t✴️ You start with an observation, literally. “Can I make an observation,” you might say to a team member, “I noticed you interrupted the client a lot in our meeting yesterday.”\n\n\t✴️ Next, you talk about impact. “We have so much to learn from the client, and we could be missing critical information about their problem if they think the conversation is just a one-way street.”\n\n\t✴️ The third step of OILS is the hardest. You have to listen. You have to give the chance for the feedback-recipient to respond. People want to explain themselves, and deserve that opportunity.\n\n\t✴️ Finally, you turn to creating a solution together. You might suggest, for instance, that you come up with a secret signal if you see an interruption happening. Oftentimes, the feedback receiver also has solutions to offer, and that’s all for the good.\n\nWhenever Emily visits my class on managerial skills, my students leave smarter and wiser, and so do I! Giving feedback is never easy, but OILS greases the way.",

Years ago, they instituted a policy to allow well-behaved, supervised dogs at the office. It’s obviously great for the dogs, CEO Kitty Block told me. But, she added, “During a tense meeting or a difficult moment, the empathetic presence of a dog can make connections easier and serve as a breath of fresh air.”\n\nTL;DR: Bring on the dogs. As management edicts go, it’s certainly cheaper and easier than replacing good people who want to work in the office, but just can’t say goodbye to the one thing keeping them sane. Oh wait, maybe that’s just me?\n\nRaise your paws if you like this plan. I would vote first, but Pierre is in the way.",

Does a sick day fill you with dread because you love work that much? Welcome to the Workcentrism Club. \n\nIf you’re one of the GenZers that Business Insider and LinkedIn News reports are embracing “guilt-free sick days,” I’m going to guess Workcentrism is not exactly high on your values list.

    "Suzy Welch's post 9mo ago": "I value a naughty little dachshund named Pierre and iced coffee, black. But I’m lucky that way, because if my research is correct, you probably don’t know yours.\n\nYour values, that is. Yes, I’m serious.\n\nWe talk about values at work and at home all the time – they matter. But my recent research at NYU Stern School of Business shows that only 17% of respondents who were asked, “What are your values?” could supply an answer. Most checked the box for “Don’t know,” or listed words that could best be described as virtues, such as “generosity” and “kindness.” Only a smattering of the 400 respondents, aged between 22-45 and in professional jobs, answered, “financial security” or “money.”  \n\nBecause that’s another thing about values. Even when we know our own, they can be hard to admit out loud. They’re personal, or we fear they might strike other people the wrong way. \n\nIn my class Becoming You, we spend two weeks doing activities and exercises that help us identify our values in gritty and serious detail. (For instance, Pierre and coffee are not technically values, but both reveal truer, deeper ones around self-determination and belonging.) Such inquiry is absolutely essential to the larger purpose of the class, which is answering the question, “What should I do with my life?”\n\nBut I would make the case that knowing your values is essential, period.\n\nIf you don’t know yours, my advice is to start trying to figure them out today. Books abound, and so do courses. And if you have 40 minutes to spare, you might also attend my totally free digital workshop on August 27 at 5 PM EST (link is the comments).  \n\nLook, values matter, as I said. If you know yours, let us know below how you got out of the 17%. ⬇️ If you don’t, keep searching. The sooner you find them, the sooner you can live into them, perhaps even with a crazy little pup (or two or three) by your side.",

Or, in my rather immature case this week, makes you run around announcing, “I TOLD YOU SO!” to anyone who will listen.  \n\nI’m talking about a study, reported in the The New York Times, that suggests that the more you actively seek happiness, the less happy you tend to be. Indeed, the research seems to indicate that happiness as a life goal has been vastly overhyped and oversold.\n\nSo what are we to do? Give up on trying to be happy? Of course not. We just need to try ➡ differently. ⬅  Read all about it in this week’s newsletter. Trigger warning: There will be gloating.",

    "Suzy Welch's post 9mo ago": "News flash: The fastest way to get canceled is to suggest remote work could possibly, perhaps, maybe-maybe, compromise business effectiveness. \n\nThat’s what former Google CEO Eric Schmidt just found out, as you might have heard, (https://lnkd.in/gvtK5wBa) but his experience is no surprise. Questioning remote work is a dangerous game out there. I once was quoted saying you probably would not become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company while working from home, and for the next 48 hours, I found out what it felt like to be Joan of Arc.\n\nCan we please, please stop this polarized enmity and have a normal, rational, public conversation about an important issue that touches so many? I, for one, see the pros and cons of remote work. I think most of us do. I love spending the day with my dogs and can often be just as productive working from the comfort of my home office. (Pierre also approves.) But I have also experienced the 1+1 = 3 magic of having everyone brainstorming in a room together. For instance, I am working with Perpetual right now to build a digital product, and our in-person meetings are undeniably more creative and productive. Sorry not sorry. \n\nI fully support anyone who makes the decision to work 100% remote, and I fully support the companies that require their people to be in the office some or all of the time. The world is big enough, and there is enough talent and opportunity to go around, that these two groups can co-exist without acrimony. \n\nOr am I just being too logical?",

    "Suzy Welch's post 9mo ago": "Real leadership means having the courage to be (gulp) hated. \n\nI, for one, cannot claim this super power. Blame my genes. Blame my upbringing. Blame my general wimpiness. I like it when everyone is happy. (And, even better, when no one is mad at me too.)\n\nBut think about it: Hasn’t every truly transformational leader you’ve ever known been kind of fearless? Actually, scratch “kind of.”\n\nThey’ve been bold, decisive, and risk-embracing, haters be damned. \n\nI can’t be like them, but I can really, truly admire them. \n\nCase in point: Uma Valeti, MD, the CEO of UPSIDE Foods, who just today filed a lawsuit against Florida, demanding it reverse its ban on the sale of cultivated meat. https://lnkd.in/e-5ZZ2pW\n\nYou may find animal-loving, plant-based folks (like me) annoying, overly sensitive, or just plain wrong. But you have to respect a start-up that takes on one of the world’s most powerful and well-funded special interest groups, the U.S. Agriculture Lobby.\n\nThat is conviction of purpose.\n\nWhen Upside Foods succeeds, and I believe it will, people will speak of the company’s courage. And I will be among them – recalling the first time I tasted cultivated meat in my own kitchen, with Uma and Bruce Friedrich of the The Good Food Institute.\n\nRight now, however, Upside is making history with its legal challenge, and it won’t be pretty.  \n\nLeadership (gulp again) can’t always be.",

The Steve Jobs Archive posted a short piece outlining the origin of Steve’s “Make Something Wonderful” in which Jobs says the following:\n\n“People express their deep appreciation for their species in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful, and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours, but somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted.” —Steve Jobs.\n\nThis clip of Steve Jobs inspired me to look back over this past year of writing about human creativity in many of its forms and against the background of the burgeoning use of AI on MBH4H. I’m not sure whether Ross Miller 🔜 GDC and I have made something wonderful, but at least we have made something creatively fulfilling for us and, hopefully, for our subscribers and everyone else out there in the world who has read any of the words we’ve written.\n\nHere’s to the crazy ones.",

It was a cathartic way to process my thoughts on the iconic novel I had just finished. Sketching and moving pixels is a great way to let my mind wander.\n\nBefore I started, all I knew was that I wanted the artwork to feel like a cyberpunk book cover. I had seen other designers break up the word Neuromancer on their covers, but I chose NEU / ROM / AN / CER to highlight “ROM,” a reference to ROM Construct in the book.\n\nThe word Neuromancer is also, annoyingly, 11 letters long. To fill the gap after “AN,” I added four dots—referencing the four dots Gibson uses as line breaks in the text messages Molly (a cyberpunk “Razorgirl”) reads on the inside of her mirror lenses.\n\nI built the letters in Adobe Illustrator, then glitched and distorted the image in Photoshop to mimic a CRT screen—a nod to Neuromancer’s 1984 release. The three colorways draw from the old Sony Trinitron logo’s green, blue, and red. And, of course, the whole creative process began with sketching. I believe in pencil before pixel.",

I respect the marque, but it’s never even occurred to me to buy one.\n\nAll of which is to say I have very mixed feelings about the rebrand: I kind of hate it, but I also admire it too.

And that, I agree, is a genuine concern.\n\nAs AI becomes more prevalent it stands to reason that it becomes increasingly more important to disclose exactly when an image has been manipulated; it's a safety issue.\"\n\nThis quote is from an essay I published yesterday on MBH4H. Later that same day, The Verge's Chris Welch published an incredible set of pictures using Google's \"reimagine\" feature as part of his review of the Pixel 9 phones, and... well, the photos speak for themselves.\n\nChris managed to add car wrecks, a helicopter crash, drug paraphernalia, and even corpses in a crash scene to his photos in a matter of seconds just by typing a prompt.\n\nAs I wrote in my piece yesterday, all of these photo editing techniques have been available to photographers for decades. However, this level of retouching was time-consuming, difficult, and required powerful computers.\n\nBut what I find genuinely alarming is that there is nothing to alert the viewer to the fact that the image has been altered (except deep down in the metadata). It's not so much what \"reimagine\" can do but the speed with which it can do it.\n\nYesterday, I wrote that putting these AI tools in phones \"is a genuine concern.\" After seeing the photos in Chris's review, that was a monumental understatement.",
